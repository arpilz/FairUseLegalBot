SONY CORPORATION OF AMERICA ET AL. v.
UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC., ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 81-1687. Argued January 18, 1983—Reargued October 3, 1988—
Decided January 17, 1984

Petitioner Sony Corp. manufactures home video tape recorders (VTR’s),
and markets them through retail establishments, some of which are also
petitioners. Respondents own the copyrights on some of the television
programs that are broadcast on the public airwaves. Respondents
brought an action against petitioners in Federal District Court, alleging
that VTR consumers had been recording some of respondents’ copy-
righted works that had been exhibited on commercially sponsored tele-
vision and thereby infringed respondents’ copyrights, and further that
petitioners were liable for such copyright infringement because of their
marketing of the VTR’s. Respondents sought money damages, an equi-
table accounting of profits, and an injunction against the manufacture
and marketing of the VTR’s. The District Court denied respondents all
relief, holding that noncommercial home use recording of material broad-
cast over the public airwaves was a fair use of copyrighted works and did
not constitute copyright infringement, and that petitioners could not be
held liable as contributory infringers even if the home use of a VTR was
considered an infringing use. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding
petitioners liable for contributory infringement and ordering the District
Court to fashion appropriate relief.

Held: The sale of the VTR’s to the general public does not constitute con-
tributory infringement of respondents’ copyrights. Pp. 428-456.

(a) The protection given to copyrights is wholly statutory, and, in a
case like this, in which Congress has not plainly marked the course to be
followed by the judiciary, this Court must be circumspect in construing
the scope of rights created by a statute that never contemplated such a
calculus of interests. Any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work
for a “fair use”; the copyright owner does not possess the exclusive right
to such ause. Pp. 428-434.

(b) Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S. 55, does not support re-
spondents’ novel theory that supplying the “means” to accomplish an in-
fringing activity and encouraging that activity through advertisement
are sufficient to establish liability for copyright infringement. This case
does not fall in the category of those in which it is manifestly just to

Syllabus 464 U.S.

impose vicarious liability because the “contributory” infringer was in a
position to control the use of copyrighted works by others and had au-
thorized the use without permission from the copyright owner. Here,
the only contact between petitioners and the users of the VTR’s occurred
at the moment of sale. And there is no precedent for imposing vicarious
liability on the theory that petitioners sold the VTR’s with construc-
tive knowledge that their customers might use the equipment to make
unauthorized copies of copyrighted material. The sale of copying equip-
ment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute
contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate,
unobjectionable purposes, or, indeed, is merely capable of substantial
noninfringing uses. Pp. 434~442.

(c) The record and the District Court’s findings show (1) that there is a
significant likelihood that substantial numbers of copyright holders who
license their works for broadcast on free television would not object to
having their broadcast time-shifted by private viewers (i. e., recorded at
a time when the VTR owner cannot view the broadcast so that it can be
watched at a later time); and (2) that there is no likelihood that time-
shifting would cause nonminimal harm to the potential market for, or the
value of, respondents’ copyrighted works. The VTR’s are therefore ca-
pable of substantial noninfringing uses. Private, noncommercial time-
shifting in the home satisfies this standard of noninfringing uses both
because respondents have no right to prevent other copyright holders
from authorizing such time-shifting for their programs, and because the
District Court’s findings reveal that even the unauthorized home time-
shifting of respondents’ programs is legitimate fair use. Pp. 442-456.

vision programs that are broadcast on the public airwaves.
Some members of the general public use video tape recorders
sold by petitioners to record some of these broadcasts, as
well as a large number of other broadcasts. The question
presented is whether the sale of petitioners’ copying equip-
ment to the general public violates any of the rights con-
ferred upon respondents by the Copyright Act.

Respondents commenced this copyright infringement ac-
tion against petitioners in the United States District Court
for the Central District of California in 1976. Respondents
alleged that some individuals had used Betamax video tape
recorders (VTR’s) to record some of respondents’ copy-
righted works which had been exhibited on commercially
sponsored television and contended that these individuals
had thereby infringed respondents’ copyrights. Respond-
ents further maintained that petitioners were liable for the
copyright infringement allegedly committed by Betamax con-
sumers because of petitioners’ marketing of the Betamax
VTR’s.!. Respondents sought no relief against any Beta-
max consumer. Instead, they sought money damages and
an equitable accounting of profits from petitioners, as well
as an injunction against the manufacture and marketing of
Betamax VTR’s.

After a lengthy trial, the District Court denied respond-
ents all the relief they sought and entered judgment for peti-
tioners. 480 F. Supp. 429 (1979). The United States Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court’s
judgment on respondents’ copyright claim, holding petition-
ers liable for contributory infringement and ordering the
District Court to fashion appropriate relief. 659 F. 2d 963

These claims are not before this Court.

(1981). We granted certiorari, 457 U. S. 1116 (1982); since
we had not completed our study of the case last Term, we or-
dered reargument, 463 U. S. 1226 (1983). We now reverse.

An explanation of our rejection of respondents’ unprece-
dented attempt to impose copyright liability upon the distrib-
utors of copying equipment requires a quite detailed recita-
tion of the findings of the District Court. In summary, those
findings reveal that the average member of the public uses a
VTR principally to record a program he cannot view as it is
being televised and then to watch it once at a later time.
This practice, known as “time-shifting,” enlarges the tele-
vision viewing audience. For that reason, a significant
amount of television programming may be used in this man-
ner without objection from the owners of the copyrights on
the programs. For the same reason, even the two respond-
ents in this case, who do assert objections to time-shifting in
this litigation, were unable to prove that the practice has im-
paired the commercial value of their copyrights or has cre-
ated any likelihood of future harm. Given these findings,
there is no basis in the Copyright Act upon which respond-
ents can hold petitioners liable for distributing VTR’s to the
general public. The Court of Appeals’ holding that respond-
ents are entitled to enjoin the distribution of VTR’s, to collect
royalties on the sale of such equipment, or to obtain other
relief, if affirmed, would enlarge the scope of respondents’
statutory monopolies to encompass control over an article of
commerce that is not the subject of copyright protection.
Such an expansion of the copyright privilege is beyond the
limits of the grants authorized by Congress.

I

The two respondents in this action, Universal City Studios,
Inc., and Walt Disney Productions, produce and hold the
copyrights on a substantial number of motion pictures and
other audiovisual works. In the current marketplace, they
can exploit their rights in these works in a number of ways:


--- Page 7 ---
422 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion of the Court 464 U. S.

by authorizing theatrical exhibitions, by licensing limited
showings on cable and network television, by selling syn-
dication rights for repeated airings on local television sta-
tions, and by marketing programs on prerecorded videotapes
or videodiscs. Some works are suitable for exploitation
through all of these avenues, while the market for other
works is more limited.

Petitioner Sony manufactures millions of Betamax video
tape recorders and markets these devices through numerous
retail establishments, some of which are also petitioners in
this action.2 Sony’s Betamax VTR is a mechanism consisting
of three basic components: (1) a tuner, which receives elec-
tromagnetic signals transmitted over the television band of
the public airwaves and separates them into audio and visual
signals; (2) a recorder, which records such signals on a mag-
netic tape; and (3) an adapter, which converts the audio and
visual signals on the tape into a composite signal that can be
received by a television set.

Several capabilities of the machine are noteworthy. The
separate tuner in the Betamax enables it to record a broad-
cast off one station while the television set is tuned to another
channel, permitting the viewer, for example, to watch two
simultaneous news broadcasts by watching one “live” and re-
cording the other for later viewing. Tapes may be reused,
and programs that have been recorded may be erased either
before or after viewing. A timer in the Betamax can be used
to activate and deactivate the equipment at predetermined

?The four retailers are Carter Hawley Hales Stores, Inc., Associated
Dry Goods Corp., Federated Department Stores, Inc., and Henry’s Cam-
era Corp. The principal defendants are Sony Corporation, the manufac-
turer of the equipment, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Sony Corporation
of America, The advertising agency of Doyle Dane Bernback, Inc., also
involved in marketing the Betamax, is also a petitioner. An individual
VTR user, William Griffiths, was named as a defendant in the District
Court, but respondents sought no relief against him. Griffiths is not a
petitioner. For convenience, we shall refer to petitioners collectively as
Sony.

times, enabling an intended viewer to record programs that
are transmitted when he or she is not at home. Thus a per-
son may watch a program at home in the evening even
though it was broadcast while the viewer was at work during
the afternoon. The Betamax is also equipped with a pause
button and a fast-forward control. The pause button, when
depressed, deactivates the recorder until it is released, thus
enabling a viewer to omit a commercial advertisement from
the recording, provided, of course, that the viewer is present
when the program is recorded. The fast-forward control
enables the viewer of a previously recorded program to run
the tape rapidly when a segment he or she does not desire to
see is being played back on the television screen.

The respondents and Sony both conducted surveys of
the way the Betamax machine was used by several hundred
owners during a sample period in 1978. Although there
were some differences in the surveys, they both showed that
the primary use of the machine for most owners was “time-
shifting”—the practice of recording a program to view it once
at a later time, and thereafter erasing it. Time-shifting en-
ables viewers to see programs they otherwise would miss
because they are not at home, are occupied with other tasks,
or are viewing a program on another station at the time of
a broadcast that they desire to watch. Both surveys also
showed, however, that a substantial number of interviewees
had accumulated libraries of tapes.* Sony’s survey indicated

* As evidence of how a VTR may be used, respondents offered the tes-

timony of William Griffiths. Griffiths, although named as an individual
defendant, was a client of plaintiffs’ law firm. The District Court sum-
marized his testimony as follows:
“He owns approximately 100 tapes. When Griffiths bought his Betamax,
he intended not only to time-shift (record, play-back and then erase)
but also to build a library of cassettes. Maintaining a library, however,
proved too expensive, and he is now erasing some earlier tapes and reusing
them.

“Griffiths copied about 20 minutes of a Universal motion picture called
‘Never Give An Inch,’ and two episodes from Universal television series

Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

that over 80% of the interviewees watched at least as much
regular television as they had before owning a Betamax.‘ Re-
spondents offered no evidence of decreased television viewing
by Betamax owners.°

Sony introduced considerable evidence describing televi-
sion programs that could be copied without objection from
any copyright holder, with special emphasis on sports, reli-
gious, and educational programming. For example, their
survey indicated that 7.3% of all Betamax use is to record
sports events, and representatives of professional baseball,
football, basketball, and hockey testified that they had no ob-
jection to the recording of their televised events for home
use.®

entitled ‘Baa Baa Black Sheep’ and ‘Holmes and Yo Yo.’ He would have
erased each of these but for the request of plaintiffs’ counsel that it be kept.
Griffiths also testified that he had copied but already erased Universal
films called ‘Alpha Caper’ (erased before anyone saw it) and ‘Amelia Ear-
hart.’ At the time of his deposition Griffiths did not intend to keep any
Universal film in his library.

“Griffiths has also recorded documentaries, news broadcasts, sporting
events and political programs such as a rerun of the Nixon/Kennedy
debate.” 480 F. Supp. 429, 436-487 (1979).

Four other witnesses testified to having engaged in similar activity.

‘The District Court summarized some of the findings in these surveys

as follows:

“According to plaintiffs’ survey, 75.4% of the VTR owners use their
machines to record for time-shifting purposes half or most of the time.
Defendants’ survey showed that 96% of the Betamax owners had used the
machine to record programs they otherwise would have missed.

“When plaintiffs asked interviewees how many cassettes were in their li-
brary, 55.8% said there were 10 or fewer. In defendants’ survey, of the
total programs viewed by interviewees in the past month, 70.4% had been
viewed only that one time and for 57.9%, there were no plans for further
viewing.” Id., at 438.

581.9% of the defendants’ interviewees watched the same amount or
more of regular television as they did before owning a Betamax. 83.2%
reported their frequency of movie going was unaffected by Betamax.”
Id., at 439.

SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 425
417 Opinion of the Court

Respondents offered opinion evidence concerning the fu-
ture impact of the unrestricted sale of VTR’s on the commer-
cial value of their copyrights. The District Court found,
however, that they had failed to prove any likelihood of
future harm from the use of VTR’s for time-shifting. 480
F, Supp., at 469.

The District Court’s Decision

The lengthy trial of the case in the District Court con-
cerned the private, home use of VTR’s for recording pro-
grams broadcast on the public airwaves without charge to the
viewer.” No issue concerning the transfer of tapes to other
persons, the use of home-recorded tapes for public perform-
ances, or the copying of programs transmitted on pay or
cable television systems was raised. See id., at 4382-433,
442.

The District Court concluded that noncommercial home use
recording of material broadcast over the public airwaves was
a fair use of copyrighted works and did not constitute copy-
right infringement. It emphasized the fact that the material
was broadcast free to the public at large, the noncommercial
character of the use, and the private character of the activity
conducted entirely within the home. Moreover, the court
found that the purpose of this use served the public interest
in increasing access to television programming, an interest
that “is consistent with the First Amendment policy of pro-
viding the fullest possible access to information through the
public airwaves. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94, 102.” Id., at
454. Even when an entire copyrighted work was recorded,

7The trial also briefly touched upon demonstrations of the Betamax by
the retailer petitioners which were alleged to be infringements by respond-
ents. The District Court held against respondents on this claim, 480 F.
Supp., at 456-457, the Court of Appeals affirmed this holding, 659 F. 2d
963, 976 (1981), and respondents did not cross-petition on this issue.

®The court also found that this “access is not just a matter of conven-
ience, as plaintiffs have suggested. Access has been limited not simply by
inconvenience but by the basic need to work. Access to the better pro-

426 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

the District Court regarded the copying as fair use “because
there is no accompanying reduction in the market for ‘plain-
tiff’s original work.’” Ibid.

As an independent ground of decision, the District Court
also concluded that Sony could not be held liable as a con-
tributory infringer even if the home use of a VTR was consid-
ered an infringing use. The District Court noted that Sony
had no direct involvement with any Betamax purchasers who
recorded copyrighted works off the air. Sony’s advertising
was silent on the subject of possible copyright infringement,
but its instruction booklet contained the following statement:

“Television programs, films, videotapes and other ma-
terials may be copyrighted. Unauthorized recording of
such material may be contrary to the provisions of the
United States copyright laws.” Id., at 436.

The District Court assumed that Sony had constructive
knowledge of the probability that the Betamax machine
would be used to record copyrighted programs, but found
that Sony merely sold a “product capable of a variety of
uses, some of them allegedly infringing.” Jd., at 461. It
reasoned:

“Selling a staple article of commerce—e. g., a type-
writer, a recorder, a camera, a photocopying machine—
technically contributes to any infringing use subse-
quently made thereof, but this kind of ‘contribution,’ if
deemed sufficient as a basis for liability, would expand
the theory beyond precedent and arguably beyond judi-
cial management.

“.,. Commerce would indeed be hampered if manufac-
turers of staple items were held liable as contributory in-
fringers whenever they ‘constructively’ knew that some
purchasers on some occasions would use their product

gram has also been limited by the competitive practice of counterprogram-
ming.” 480 F. Supp., at 454.


--- Page 12 ---
SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 427

4\7 Opinion of the Court

for a purpose which a court later deemed, as a matter of
first impression, to be an infringement.” bid.

Finally, the District Court discussed the respondents’
prayer for injunctive relief, noting that they had asked for an
injunction either preventing the future sale of Betamax ma-
chines, or requiring that the machines be rendered incapable
of recording copyrighted works off the air. The court stated
that it had “found no case in which the manufacturers, dis-
tributors, retailers and advertisers of the instrument en-
abling the infringement were sued by the copyright holders,”
and that the request for relief in this case “is unique.” Id.,
at 465.

It concluded that an injunction was wholly inappropriate
because any possible harm to respondents was outweighed by
the fact that “the Betamax could still legally be used to
record noncopyrighted material or material whose owners
consented to the copying. An injunction would deprive the
public of the ability to use the Betamax for this noninfringing
off-the-air recording.” Id., at 468.

The Court of Appeals’ Decision

The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s judg-
ment on respondents’ copyright claim. It did not set aside
any of the District Court’s findings of fact. Rather, it con-
cluded as a matter of law that the home use of a VTR was not
a fair use because it was not a “productive use.”® It there-
fore held that it was unnecessary for plaintiffs to prove any
harm to the potential market for the copyrighted works, but
then observed that it seemed clear that the cumulative effect
of mass reproduction made possible by VTR’s would tend to
diminish the potential market for respondents’ works. 659
F. 2d, at 974.

*“Without a ‘productive use,’ i. e. when copyrighted material is repro-
duced for its intrinsic use, the mass copying of the sort involved in this case
precludes an application of fair use.” 659 F. 2d, at 971-972.


--- Page 13 ---
428 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

On the issue of contributory infringement, the Court of Ap-
peals first rejected the analogy to staple articles of commerce
such as tape recorders or photocopying machines. It noted
that such machines “may have substantial benefit for some
purposes” and do not “even remotely raise copyright prob-
lems.” Jd., at 975. WVTR’s, however, are sold “for the pri-
mary purpose of reproducing television programming” and
“{vjirtually all” such programming is copyrighted material.
Ibid. The Court of Appeals concluded, therefore, that VTR’s
were not suitable for any substantial noninfringing use even
if some copyright owners elect not to enforce their rights.

_The Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court’s re-
liance on Sony’s lack of knowledge that home use constituted
infringement. Assuming that the statutory provisions defin-
ing the remedies for infringement applied also to the non-
statutory tort of contributory infringement, the court stated
that a defendant’s good faith would merely reduce his dam-
ages liability but would not excuse the infringing conduct.
It held that Sony was chargeable with knowledge of the
homeowner’s infringing activity because the reproduction of
copyrighted materials was either “the most conspicuous use”
or “the major use” of the Betamax product. Ibid.

On the matter of relief, the Court of Appeals concluded
that “statutory damages may be appropriate” and that the
District Court should reconsider its determination that an in-
junction would not be an appropriate remedy; and, referring
to “the analogous photocopying area,” suggested that a con-
tinuing royalty pursuant to a judicially created compulsory
license may very well be an acceptable resolution of the relief
issue. Id., at 976.

Il

Article I, §8, of the Constitution provides:

“The Congress shall have Power . . . To Promote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for lim-
ited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right
to their respective Writings and Discoveries.”


--- Page 14 ---
SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 429
417 Opinion of the Court

The monopoly privileges that Congress may authorize are
neither unlimited nor primarily designed to provide a special
private benefit. Rather. the limited grant is a means by
which an important public purpose may be achieved. It is
intended to motivate the creative activity of authors and in-
ventors by the provision of a special reward, and to allow the
public access to the products of their genius after the limited
period of exclusive control has expired.

“The copyright law, like the patent statutes, makes re-
ward to the owner a secondary consideration. In Fox
Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U. S. 123, 127, Chief Justice
Hughes spoke as follows respecting the copyright mo-
nopoly granted by Congress, ‘The sole interest of the
United States and the primary object in conferring the
monopoly lie in the general benefits derived by the pub-
lic from the labors of authors.’ It is said that reward to
the author or artist serves to induce release to the public
of the products of his creative genius.” United States v.
Paramount Pictures, Inc., 384 U. S. 181, 158 (1948).

As the text of the Constitution makes plain, it is Congress.
that has been assigned the task of defining the scope of the
limited monopoly that should be granted to authors or to in-
ventors in order to give the public appropriate access to their
work product. Because this task involves a difficult balance
between the interests of authors and inventors in the control
and exploitation of their writings and discoveries on the one
hand, and society’s competing interest in the free flow of
ideas, information, and commerce on the other hand, our pat-
ent and copyright statutes have been amended repeatedly.”

“In its Report accompanying the comprehensive revision of the Copy-
right Act in 1909, the Judiciary Committee of the House of Represent-
atives explained this balance:

“The enactment of copyright legislation by Congress under the terms of
the Constitution is not based upon any natural right that the author has in
his writings, . . . but upon the ground that the welfare of the public will be

Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

From its beginning, the law of copyright has developed in
response to significant changes in technology."" Indeed, it
was the invention of a new form of copying equipment—the
printing press—that gave rise to the original need for copy-
right protection.” Repeatedly, as new developments have

served and progress of science and useful arts will be promoted by securing
to authors for limited periods the exclusive rights to their writings. . . .

“In enacting a copyright law Congress must consider . . . two questions:
First, how much wil! the legislation stimulate the producer and so benefit
the public; and, second, how much will the monopoly granted be detri-
mental to the public? The granting of such exclusive rights, under the
proper terms and conditions, confers a benefit upon the public that out-
weighs the evils of the temporary monopoly.” H.R. Rep. No. 2222, 60th
Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1909).

""Thus, for example, the development and marketing of player pianos
and perforated rolls of music, see White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v.
Apollo Co., 209 U. S. 1 (1908), preceded the enactment of the Copyright
Act of 1909; innovations in copying techniques gave rise to the statutory
exemption for library copying embodied in § 108 of the 1976 revision of the
copyright law; the development of the technology that made it possible to
retransmit television programs by cable or by microwave systems, see
Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U. S. 390 (1968),
and Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415
U.S. 894 (1974), prompted the enactment of the complex provisions set
forth in 17 U. S. C. §111(d)(2)(B) and § 111(d)(5) (1982 ed.) after years of
detailed congressional study, see Eastern Microwave, Inc. v. Doubleday
Sports, Inc., 691 F. 2d 125, 129 (CA2 1982).

By enacting the Sound Recording Amendment of 1971, 85 Stat. 391,
Congress also provided the solution to the “record piracy” problems that
had been created by the development of the audio tape recorder. Sony
argues that the legislative history of that Act, see especially H. R. Rep.
No. 92-487, p. 7 (1971), indicates that Congress did not intend to prohibit
the private home use of either audio or video tape recording equipment.
In view of our disposition of the contributory infringement issue, we ex-
press no opinion on that question.

““Copyright protection became necessary with the invention of the
printing press and had its early beginnings in the British censorship laws.
The fortunes of the law of copyright have always been closely connected
with freedom of expression, on the one hand, and with technological im-
provements in means of dissemination, on the other. Successive ages
have drawn different balances among the interest of the writer in the con-
trol and exploitation of his intellectual property, the related interest of the

occurred in this country, it has been the Congress that has
fashioned the new rules that new technology made necessary.
Thus, long before the enactment of the Copyright Act of
1909, 35 Stat. 1075, it was settled that the protection given
to copyrights is wholly statutory. Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet.
591, 661-662 (1834). The remedies for infringement “are
only those prescribed by Congress.” Thompson v. Hub-
bard, 131 U. S. 128, 151 (1889).

The judiciary’s reluctance to expand the protections af-
forded by the copyright without explicit legislative guidance
is a recurring theme. See, e. g., Teleprompter Corp. v.
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U. 8. 394 (1974);
Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392
U.S. 390 (1968); White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v.
Apollo Co., 209 U. S. 1 (1908); Williams & Wilkins Co. v.
United States, 203 Ct. Cl. 74, 487 F. 2d 1345 (1973), aff’d
by an equally divided Court, 420 U. S. 376 (1975). Sound
policy, as well as history, supports our consistent deference
to Congress when major technological innovations alter the
market for copyrighted materials. Congress has the con-
stitutional authority and the institutional ability to accom-
modate fully the varied permutations of competing interests
that are inevitably implicated by such new technology.

In a case like this, in which Congress has not plainly
marked our course, we must be circumspect in construing the
scope of rights created by a legislative enactment which
never contemplated such a calculus of interests. In doing so,
we are guided by Justice Stewart’s exposition of the correct
approach to ambiguities in the law of copyright:

“The limited scope of the copyright holder’s statutory
monopoly, like the limited copyright duration required
by the Constitution, reflects a balance of competing
claims upon the public interest: Creative work is to be

publisher, and the competing interest of society in the untrammeled dis-
semination of ideas.” Foreword to B. Kaplan, An Unhurried View of
Copyright vii-viii (1967).

encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must
ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public
availability of literature, music, and the other arts. The
immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair
return for an ‘author’s’ creative labor. But the ultimate
aim is, by this incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity
for the general public good. ‘The sole interest of the
United States and the primary object in conferring the
monopoly,’ this Court has said, ‘lie in the general bene-
fits derived by the public from the labors of authors.’
Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U. S. 128, 127. See Ken-
dall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 327-328; Grant v. Ray-
mond, 6 Pet. 218, 241-242. When technological change
has rendered its literal terms ambiguous, the Copyright
Act must be construed in light of this basic purpose.”

Copyright protection “subsists . . . in original works of

absolute control of his work, the natural tendency of legal rights to express
themselves in absolute terms to the exclusion of all else is particularly pro-
nounced in the history of the constitutionally sanctioned monopolies of the
copyright and the patent. See, e. g., United States v. Paramount Pic-

copyright holder “exclusive” rights to use and to authorize
the use of his work in five qualified ways, including repro-
duction of the copyrighted work in copies. §106. All re-
productions of the work, however, are not within the exclu-
sive domain of the copyright owner; some are in the public
domain. Any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work
for a “fair use”; the copyright owner does not possess the
exclusive right to such a use. Compare § 106 with § 107.

“Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the
copyright owner,” that is, anyone who trespasses into his
exclusive domain by using or authorizing the use of the copy-
righted work in one of the five ways set forth in the statute,
‘4s an infringer of the copyright.” §501(a). Conversely,
anyone who is authorized by the copyright owner to use the
copyrighted work in a way specified in the statute or who
makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copy-
right with respect to such use.

The Copyright Act provides the owner of a copyright with
a potent arsenal of remedies against an infringer of his work,
including an injunction to restrain the infringer from violat-

U. S. 181 (1936) (patentees claiming right to tie sale of unpatented article
to lease of patented device).

“Section 106 of the Act provides:

“Subject to sections 107 through 118, the owner of copyright under this
title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:

“(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;

“(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;

“(8) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to
the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending;

“(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform
the copyrighted work publicly; and

“(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the indi-
vidual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the
copyrighted work publicly.”

ing his rights, the impoundment and destruction of all re-
productions of his work made in violation of his rights, a
recovery of his actual damages and any additional profits re-
alized by the infringer or a recovery of statutory damages,
and attorney’s fees. §§502-505.""

The two respondents in this case do not seek relief against
the Betamax users who have allegedly infringed their copy-
rights. Moreover, this is not a class action on behalf of all
copyright owners who license their works for television
broadcast, and respondents have no right to invoke whatever
rights other copyright holders may have to bring infringe-
ment actions based on Betamax copying of their works.""® As
was made clear by their own evidence, the copying of the re-
spondents’ programs represents a small portion of the total
use of VTR’s. It is, however, the taping of respondents’
own copyrighted programs that provides them with standing
to charge Sony with contributory infringement. To prevail,
they have the burden of proving that users of the Betamax
have infringed their copyrights and that Sony should be held
responsible for that infringement.

Il

The Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable
for infringement committed by another. In contrast, the

Moreover, anyone who willfully infringes the copyright to reproduce a
motion picture for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial
gain is subject to substantial criminal penalties, 17 U. S. C. § 506(a) (1982
ed.), and the fruits and instrumentalities of the crime are forfeited upon
conviction, § 506(b).

In this regard, we reject respondents’ attempt to cast this action as
comparable to a class action because of the positions taken by amict with
copyright interests and their attempt to treat the statements made by
amici as evidence in this case. See Brief for Respondents 1, and n. 1, 6,
52, 53, and n. 116. The stated desires of amici concerning the outcome of
this or any litigation are no substitute for a class action, are not evidence in
the case, and do not influence our decision; we examine an amicus curiae
brief solely for whatever aid it provides in analyzing the legal questions
before us.

SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 435
417 Opinion of the Court

Patent Act expressly brands anyone who “actively induces
infringement of a patent” as an infringer, 35 U. S. C. §271(b),
and further imposes liability on certain individuals labeled
“contributory” infringers, §271(c). The absence of such ex-
press language in the copyright statute does not preclude the
imposition of liability for copyright infringements on certain
parties who have not themselves engaged in the infringing
activity.” For vicarious liability is imposed in virtually all
areas of the law, and the concept of contributory infringe-
ment is merely a species of the broader problem of identify-
ing the circumstances in which it is just to hold one individual
accountable for the actions of another.

Such circumstances were plainly present in Kalem Co. v.
Harper Brothers, 222 U. S. 55 (1911), the copyright decision
of this Court on which respondents place their principal reli-
ance. In Kalem, the Court held that the producer of an un-
authorized film dramatization of the copyrighted book Ben
Hur was liable for his sale of the motion picture to jobbers,
who in turn arranged for the commercial exhibition of the
film. Justice Holmes, writing for the Court, explained:

“The defendant not only expected but invoked by ad-
vertisement the use of its films for dramatic reproduc-

"" As the District Court correctly observed, however, “the lines between
direct infringement, contributory infringement and vicarious liability are
not clearly drawn....” 480 F. Supp., at 457-458. The lack of clarity in
this area may, in part, be attributable to the fact that an infringer is not
merely one who uses a work without authorization by the copyright owner,
but also one who authorizes the use of a copyrighted work without actual
authority from the copyright owner.

We note the parties’ statements that the questions of Sony’s liability
under the “doctrines” of “direct infringement” and “vicarious liability” are
not nominally before this Court. Compare Brief for Respondents 9, n. 22,
41, n. 90, with Reply Brief for Petitioners 1, n. 2. We also observe, how-
ever, that reasoned analysis of respondents’ unprecedented contributory
infringement claim necessarily entails consideration of arguments and case
law which may also be forwarded under the other labels, and indeed the
parties to a large extent rely upon such arguments and authority in support
of their respective positions on the issue of contributory infringement.

tion of the story. That was the most conspicuous pur-
pose for which they could be used, and the one for which
especially they were made. If the defendant did not
contribute to the infringement it is impossible to do so
except by taking part in the final act. It is liable on
principles recognized in every part of the law.” Id., at
62-63.

The use for which the item sold in Kalem had been “espe-
cially” made was, of course, to display the performance that
had already been recorded upon it. The producer had per-
sonally appropriated the copyright owner’s protected work
and, as the owner of the tangible medium of expression upon
which the protected work was recorded, authorized that use
by his sale of the film to jobbers. But that use of the film
was not his to authorize: the copyright owner possessed the
exclusive right to authorize public performances of his work.
Further, the producer personally advertised the unau-
thorized public performances, dispelling any possible doubt
as to the use of the film which he had authorized.

Respondents argue that Kalem stands for the proposition
that supplying the “means” to accomplish an infringing activ-
_ ity and encouraging that activity through advertisement are
sufficient to establish liability for copyright infringement.
This argument rests on a gross generalization that cannot
withstand scrutiny. The producer in Kalem did not merely
provide the “means” to accomplish an infringing activity; the
producer supplied the work itself, albeit in a new medium of
expression. Sony in the instant case does not supply
Betamax consumers with respondents’ works; respondents
do. Sony supplies a piece of equipment that is generally
capable of copying the entire range of programs that may
be televised: those that are uncopyrighted, those that are
copyrighted but may be copied without objection from the
copyright holder, and those that the copyright holder would
prefer not to have copied. The Betamax can be used to

SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 487
417 Opinion of the Court

make authorized or unauthorized uses of copyrighted works,
but the range of its potential use is much broader than the
particular infringing use of the film Ben Hur involved in
Kalem. Kalem does not support respondents’ novel theory
of liability.

Justice Holmes stated that the producer had “contributed”
to the infringement of the copyright, and the label “contribu-
tory infringement” has been applied in a number of lower
court copyright cases involving an ongoing relationship be-
tween the direct infringer and the contributory infringer at
the time the infringing conduct occurred. In such cases, as
in other situations in which the imposition of vicarious lia-
bility is manifestly just, the “contributory” infringer was in.a
position to control the use of copyrighted works by others
and had authorized the use without permission from the
copyright owner.” This case, however, plainly does not fall

""The so-called “dance hall cases,” Famous Music Corp. v. Bay State
Harness Horse Racing & Breeding Assn., Inc., 554 F. 2d 1218 (CA1 1977)
(racetrack retained infringer to supply music to paying customers); KECA
Music, Inc. v. Dingus McGee's Co., 432 F. Supp. 72 (WD Mo. 1977)
(cocktail lounge hired musicians to supply music to paying customers);
Dreamland Ball Room, Inc. v. Shapiro, Bernstein & Co., 36 F. 2d 354
(CAT 1929) (dance hall hired orchestra to supply music to paying custom-
ers), are often contrasted with the so-called landlord-tenant cases, in which
landlords who leased premises to a direct infringer for a fixed rental and
did not participate directly in any infringing activity were found not to be
liable for contributory infringement. FE. g., Deutsch v. Arnold, 98 F. 2d
686 (CA2 1938).

In Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304 (CA2
1963), the owner of 23 chainstores retained the direct infringer to run its
record departments. The relationship was structured as a licensing ar-
rangement, so that the defendant bore none of the business risk of running
the department. Instead, it received 10% or 12% of the direct infringer’s
gross receipts. The Court of Appeals concluded:

“(The dance-hall cases] and this one lie closer on the spectrum to the

in that category. The only contact between Sony and the
users of the Betamax that is disclosed by this record occurred
at the moment of sale. The District Court expressly found
that “no employee of Sony, Sonam or DDBI had either direct
involvement with the allegedly infringing activity or direct
contact with purchasers of Betamax who recorded copy-
righted works off-the-air.” 480 F. Supp., at 460. And it
further found that “there was no evidence that any of the
copies made by Griffiths or the other individual witnesses
in this suit were influenced or encouraged by [Sony’s] adver-
tisements.” Ibid.

‘bootleg’ records.

“. .. [T]he imposition of vicarious liability in the case before us cannot be
deemed unduly harsh or unfair. Green has the power to police carefully
the conduct of its concessionaire . . .; our judgment will simply encourage
it to do so, thus placing responsibility where it can and should be effec-
tively exercised.” Id., at 8308 (emphasis in original).

In Gershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management, Inc.,
443 F. 2d 1159 (CA2 1971), the direct infringers retained the contribu-
tory infringer to manage their performances. The contributory infringer
would contact each direct infringer, obtain the titles of the musical compo-
sitions to be performed, print the programs, and then sell the programs to
its own local organizations for distribution at the time of the direct infringe-
ment. Jd., at 1161. The Court of Appeals emphasized that the contribu-
tory infringer had actual knowledge that the artists it was managing were
performing copyrighted works, was in a position to police the infringing
conduct of the artists, and derived substantial benefit from the actions of
the primary infringers. Id., at 1163.

In Screen Gems-Columbia Music, Inc. v. Mark-Fi Records, Inc., 256 F.
Supp. 399 (SDNY 1966), the direct infringer manufactured and sold boot-
leg records. In denying a motion for summary judgment, the District
Court held that the infringer’s advertising agency, the radio stations that
advertised the infringer’s works, and the service agency that boxed and
mailed the infringing goods could all be held liable, if at trial it could be
demonstrated that they knew or should have known that they were dealing
in illegal goods.


--- Page 24 ---
SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 439
417 Opinion of the Court

If vicarious liability is to be imposed on Sony in this case, it
must rest on the fact that it has sold equipment with con-
structive knowledge of the fact that its customers may use
that equipment to make unauthorized copies of copyrighted
material. There is no precedent in the law of copyright for
the imposition of vicarious liability on such a theory. The
closest analogy is provided by the patent law cases to which
it is appropriate to refer because of the historic kinship
between patent law and copyright law.”

""E.g., United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 384 U. S., at 158;
Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U. S., at 131; Wheaton v, Peters, 8 Pet. 591,
657-658 (1834). The two areas of the law, naturally, are not identical
twins, and we exercise the caution which we have expressed in the past
in applying doctrine formulated in one area to the other. See generally
Mazer v. Stein, 347 U. S. 201, 217-218 (1954); Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus,
210 U. S., at 345.

We have consistently rejected the proposition that a similar kinship ex-
ists between copyright law and trademark law, and in the process of doing
so have recognized the basic similarities between copyrights and patents.
The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 91-92 (1879); see also United Drug
Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., 248 U. 8. 90, 97 (1918) (trademark right
“has little or no analogy” to copyright or patent); McLean v. Fleming, 96
U. S. 245, 254 (1878); Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall, 311, 322 (1872). Given
the fundamental differences between copyright law and trademark law, in
this copyright case we do not look to the standard for contributory infringe-
ment set forth in Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456
U. S. 844, 854-855 (1982), which was crafted for application in trademark
eases. There we observed that a manufacturer or distributor could be
held liable to the owner of a trademark if it intentionally induced a mer-
chant down the chain of distribution to pass off its product as that of
the trademark owner’s or if it continued to supply a product which could
readily be passed off to a particular merchant whom it knew was mislabel-
ing the product with the trademark owner’s mark. If Imwood’s narrow
standard for contributory trademark infringement governed here, re-
spondents’ claim of contributory infringement would merit little discussion.
Sony certainly does not “intentionally inducfe]}” its customers to make
infringing uses of respondents’ copyrights, nor does it supply its products
to identified individuals known by it to be engaging in continuing infringe-
ment of respondents’ copyrights, see id., at 855.


--- Page 25 ---
440 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

In the Patent Act both the concept of infringement and
the concept of contributory infringement are expressly de-
fined by statute.” The prohibition against contributory in-
fringement is confined to the knowing sale of a component
especially made for use in connection with a particular pat-
ent. There is no suggestion in the statute that one patentee
may object to the sale of a product that might be used in con-
nection with other patents. Moreover, the Act expressly
provides that the sale of a “staple article or commodity of
commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use” is not
contributory infringement. 35 U.S. C. §271(c).

When a charge of contributory infringement is predicated
entirely on the sale of an article of commerce that is used by
the purchaser to infringe a patent, the public interest in ac-
cess to that article of commerce is necessarily implicated. A

® Title 35 U. S. C. §271 provides:

“(a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without author-
ity makes, uses or sells any patented invention, within the United States
during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.

“(b) Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as
an infringer.

“(c) Whoever sells a component of a patented machine, manufacture,
combination or composition, or a material or apparatus for use in practicing
a patented process, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing
the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringe-
ment of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce
suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory
infringer.

“(d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement or
contributory infringement of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed
guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his hav-
ing done one or more of the following: (1) derived revenue from acts which
if performed by another without his consent would constitute contributory
infringement of the patent; (2) licensed or authorized another to perform
acts which if performed without his consent would constitute contributory
infringement of the patent; (3) sought to enforce his patent rights against
infringement or contributory infringement.”

SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 441
417 Opinion of the Court

finding of contributory infringement does not, of course, re-
move the article from the market altogether; it does, how-
ever, give the patentee effective control over the sale of that
item. Indeed, a finding of contributory infringement is nor-
mally the functional equivalent of holding that the disputed
article is within the monopoly granted to the patentee.”
For that reason, in contributory infringement cases arising
under the patent laws the Court has always recognized the
critical importance of not allowing the patentee to extend
his monopoly beyond the limits of his specific grant. These
cases deny the patentee any right to control the distribution
of unpatented articles unless they are “unsuited for any com-
mercial noninfringing use.” Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm
& Hass Co., 448 U. S. 176, 198.(1980). Unless a commodity
“has no use except through practice of the patented method,”
id., at 199, the patentee has no right to claim that its distri-
bution constitutes contributory infringement. “To form the
basis for contributory infringement the item must almost be
uniquely suited as a component of the patented invention.”
P. Rosenberg, Patent Law Fundamentals § 17.02[2] (2d ed.
1982). “[A] sale of an article which though adapted to an in-
fringing use is also adapted to other and lawful uses, is not
enough to make the seller a contributory infringer. Such a
rule would block the wheels of commerce.” Henry v. A. B.
Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, 48 (1912), overruled on other grounds,

“Tt seems extraordinary to suggest that the Copyright Act confers upon
all copyright owners collectively, much less the two respondents in this
case, the exclusive right to distribute VTR’s simply because they may be
used to infringe copyrights. That, however, is the logical implication of
their claim. The request for an injunction below indicates that respond-
ents seek, in effect, to declare VTR’s contraband. Their suggestion in this
Court that a continuing royalty pursuant to a judicially created compulsory
license would be an acceptable remedy merely indicates that respondents,
for their part, would be willing to license their claimed monopoly interest in
VTR’s to Sony in return for a royalty.

Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243
U.S. 502, 517 (1917).

We recognize there are substantial differences between the
patent and copyright laws. But in both areas the contribu-
tory infringement doctrine is grounded on the recognition
that adequate protection of a monopoly may require the
courts to look beyond actual duplication of a device or publi-
cation to the products or activities that make such duplication
possible. The staple article of commerce doctrine must
strike a balance between a copyright holder’s legitimate de-
mand for effective—not merely symbolic—protection of the
statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage
in substantially unrelated areas of commerce. Accordingly,
the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of
commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if
the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable
purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial
noninfringing uses.

IV

The question is thus whether the Betamax is capable of
commercially significant noninfringing uses. In order to
resolve that question, we need not explore all the different
potential uses of the machine and determine whether or not
they would constitute infringement. Rather, we need only
consider whether on the basis of the facts as found by the
District Court a significant number of them would be non-
infringing. Moreover, in order to resolve this case we need
not give precise content to the question of how much use is
commercially significant. For one potential use of the Beta-
max plainly satisfies this standard, however it is understood:
private, noncommercial time-shifting in the home. It does
so both (A) because respondents have no right to prevent
other copyright holders from authorizing it for their pro-
grams, and (B) because the District Court’s factual findings
reveal that even the unauthorized home time-shifting of
respondents’ programs is legitimate fair use.

7 Opinion of the Court ,

""A. Authorized Time-Shifting

Each of the respondents owns a large inventory of valuable
copyrights, but in the total spectrum of television program-
ming their combined market share is small. The exact per-
centage is not specified, but it is well below 10%.” If they
were to prevail, the outcome of this litigation would have a
significant impact on both the producers and the viewers of
the remaining 90% of the programming in the Nation. No
doubt, many other producers share respondents’ concern
about the possible consequences of unrestricted copying.
Nevertheless the findings of the District Court make it clear
that time-shifting may enlarge the total viewing audience and
that many producers are willing to allow private time-shifting
to continue, at least for an experimental time period.”

The District Court found:

“Even if it were deemed that home-use recording of
copyrighted material constituted infringement, the Beta-
max could still legally be used to record noncopyrighted
material or material whose owners consented to the
copying. An injunction would deprive the public of the
ability to use the Betamax for this noninfringing off-the-
air recording.

2The record suggests that Disney’s programs.at the time of trial con-
sisted of approximately one hour a week of network television and one
syndicated series. Universal’s percentage in the Los Angeles market on
commercial television stations was under 5%. See Tr. 532-533, 549-550.

“The District Court did not make any explicit findings with regard to
how much broadcasting is wholly uncopyrighted. The record does include
testimony that at least one movie—My Man Godfrey—falls within that cat-
egory, id., at 2300-2301, and certain broadcasts produced by the Federal
Government are also uncopyrighted. See 17 U.S. C. §105 (1982 ed.).
Cf. Schnapper v. Foley, 215 U.S. App. D. C. 59, 667 F. 2d 102 (1981)
(explaining distinction between work produced by the Government and
work commissioned by the Government). To the extent such broadcasting
is now significant, it further bolsters our conclusion. Moreover, since
copyright protection is not perpetual, the number of audiovisual works in
the public domain necessarily increases each year.

444 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

“Defendants introduced considerable testimony at
trial about the potential for such copying of sports, re-
ligious, educational and other programming. This in-
cluded testimony from representatives of the Offices of
the Commissioners of the National Football, Basketball,
Baseball and Hockey Leagues and Associations, the Ex-
ecutive Director of National Religious Broadcasters and
various educational communications agencies. Plaintiffs
attack the weight of the testimony offered and also con-
tend that an injunction is warranted because infringing
uses outweigh noninfringing uses.

“Whatever the future percentage of legal versus il-
legal home-use recording might be, an injunction which
seeks to deprive the public of the very tool or article of
commerce capable of some noninfringing use would be an
extremely harsh remedy, as well as one unprecedented
in copyright law.” 480 F. Supp., at 468.

Although the District Court made these statements in the
context of considering the propriety of injunctive relief, the
statements constitute a finding that the evidence concerning
“sports, religious, educational and other programming” was
sufficient to establish a significant quantity of broadcasting
whose copying is now authorized, and a significant potential
for future authorized copying. That finding is amply sup-
ported by the record. In addition to the religious and sports
officials identified explicitly by the District Court,* two items
in the record deserve specific mention.

417 Opinion of the Court

First is the testimony of John Kenaston, the station man-
ager of Channel 58, an educational station in Los Angeles
affiliated with the Public Broadcasting Service. He ex-
plained and authenticated the station’s published guide to its
programs.” For each program, the guide tells whether un-
limited home taping is authorized, home taping is authorized
subject to certain restrictions (such as erasure within seven
days), or home taping is not authorized at all. The Spring
1978 edition of the guide described 107 programs. Sixty-two
of those programs or 58% authorize some home taping.
Twenty-one of them or almost 20% authorize unrestricted
home taping.®

Second is the testimony of Fred Rogers, president of the
corporation that produces and owns the copyright on Mister
Rogers’ Neighborhood. The program is carried by more
public television stations than any other program. Its audi-
ence numbers over 3,000,000 families a day. He testified
that he had absolutely no objection to home taping for non-
commercial use and expressed the opinion that it is a real
service to families to be able to record children’s programs
and to show them at appropriate times.”

See also Tr. 2833-2844 (similar testimony by executive director of New
Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority). Cf. id., at 2592-2605 (testimony

cations approving home taping for educational purposes).

7“Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the
‘Neighborhood’ at hours when some children cannot use it. I think that
it’s a real service to families to be able to record such programs and show
them at appropriate times. I have always felt that with the advent of all
of this new technology that allows people to tape the ‘Neighborhood’ off-
the-air, and I’m speaking for the ‘Neighborhood’ because that’s what I
produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of
their family’s television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being
programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always
been ‘You are an important person just the way you are. You can make
healthy decisions.’ Maybe I’m going on too long, but I just feel that any-
thing that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life,

446 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

If there are millions of owners of VTR’s who make copies of
televised sports events, religious broadcasts, and educational
programs such as Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, and if the
proprietors of those programs welcome the practice, the busi-
ness of supplying the equipment that makes such copying fea-
sible should not be stifled simply because the equipment is
used by some individuals to make unauthorized reproductions
of respondents’ works. The respondents do not represent a
class composed of all copyright holders. Yet a finding of con-
tributory infringement would inevitably frustrate the inter-
ests of broadcasters in reaching the portion of their audience
that is available only through time-shifting.

Of course, the fact that other copyright holders may wel-
come the practice of time-shifting does not mean that re-
spondents should be deemed to have granted a license to copy
their programs. Third-party conduct would be wholly irrel-
evant in an action for direct infringement of respondents’
copyrights. But in an action for contributory infringement
against the seller of copying equipment, the copyright holder
may not prevail unless the relief that he seeks affects only his
programs, or unless he speaks for virtually all copyright hold-
ers with an interest in the outcome. In this case, the record
makes it perfectly clear that there are many important pro-
ducers of national and local television programs who find
nothing objectionable about the enlargement in the size of the
television audience that results from the practice of time-
shifting for private home use.” The seller of the equipment
that expands those producers’ audiences cannot be a con-

in a healthy way, is important.” Jd., at 2920-2921. See also Defendants’
Exh. PI, p. 85.

“Tt may be rare for large numbers of copyright owners to authorize
duplication of their works without demanding a fee from the copier. In
the context of public broadcasting, however, the user of the copyrighted
work is not required to pay a fee for access to the underlying work. The
traditional method by which copyright owners capitalize upon the tele-
vision medium—commercially sponsored free public broadcast over the
public airwaves—is predicated upon the assumption that compensation for

tributory infringer if, as is true in this case, it has had no
direct involvement with any infringing activity.

B. Unauthorized Time-Shifting

Even unauthorized uses of a copyrighted work are not nec-
essarily infringing. An unlicensed use of the copyright is not
an infringement unless it conflicts with one of the specific ex-
clusive rights conferred by the copyright statute. Twentieth
Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S., at 154-155. More-
over, the definition of exclusive rights in § 106 of the present
Act is prefaced by the words “subject to sections 107 through
118.” Those sections describe a variety of uses of copy-
righted material that “are not infringements of copyright”
“notwithstanding the provisions of section 106.” The most
pertinent in this case is § 107, the legislative endorsement of
the doctrine of “fair use.” ”

the value of displaying the works will be received in the form of advertising
revenues. :

In the context of television programming, some producers evidently be-
lieve that permitting home viewers to make copies of their works off the air
actually enhances the value of their copyrights. Irrespective of their rea-
sons for authorizing the practice, they do so, and in significant enough
numbers to create a substantial market for a noninfringing use of the Sony
VTR’s. No one could dispute the legitimacy of that market if the produc-
ers had authorized home taping of their programs in exchange for a license
fee paid directly by the home user. The legitimacy of that market is not
compromised simply because these producers have authorized home taping
of their programs without demanding a fee from the home user. The copy-
right law does not require a copyright owner to charge a fee for the use of
his works, and as this record clearly demonstrates, the owner of a copy-
right may well have economic or noneconomic reasons for permitting cer-
tain kinds of copying to occur without receiving direct compensation from
the copier. It is not the role of the courts to tell copyright holders the best
way for them to exploit their copyrights: even if respondents’ competitors
were ill-advised in authorizing home videotaping, that would not change
the fact that they have created a substantial market for a paradigmatic
noninfringing use of Sony’s product.

The Copyright Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 1075, did not have a “fair use” pro-
vision. Although that Act’s compendium of exclusive rights “to print,


--- Page 33 ---
448 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

That section identifies various factors® that enable a court
to apply an “equitable rule of reason” analysis to particular
claims of infringement."" Although not conclusive, the first

reprint, publish, copy, and vend the copyrighted work” was broad enough
to encompass virtually all potential interactions with a copyrighted work,
the statute was never so construed. The courts simply refused to read the
statute literally in every situation. When Congress amended the statute
in 1976, it indicated that it “intended to restate the present judicial doc-
trine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way.” H.R.
Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 66 (1976).

* Section 107 provides:

“Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the fair use of a copy-
righted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords
or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criti-
cism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for
classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copy-
right. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular
case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

“(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is
of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

“(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

“(8) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole; and

“(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work.” 17 U.S. C. § 107 (1982 ed.).

“The House Report expressly stated that the fair use doctrine is an
“equitable rule of reason” in its explanation of the fair use section:

“Although the courts have considered and ruled upon the fair use doc-
trine over and over again, no real definition of the concept has ever
emerged. Indeed, since the doctrine is an equitable rule of reason, no gen-
erally applicable definition is possible, and each case raising the question
must be decided on its own facts. ...

“General intention behind the provision

“The statement of the fair use doctrine in section 107 offers some guid-
ance to users in determining when the principles of the doctrine apply.
However, the endless variety of situations and combinations of circum-
stances that can rise in particular cases precludes the formulation of exact
rules in the statute. The bill endorses the purpose and general scope of
the judicial doctrine of fair use, but there is no disposition to freeze the

SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 449
47 Opinion of the Court

factor requires that “the commercial or nonprofit character
of an activity” be weighed in any fair use decision.“ If the
Betamax were used to make copies for a commercial or profit-
making purpose, such use would presumptively be unfair.
The contrary presumption is appropriate here, however, be-
cause the District Court’s findings plainly establish that time-
shifting for private home use must be characterized as a
noncommercial, nonprofit activity. Moreover, when one con-
siders the nature of a televised copyrighted audiovisual work,
see 17 U. S. C. §107(2) (1982 ed.), and that time-shifting
merely enables a viewer to see such a work which he had
been invited to witness in its entirety free of charge, the fact

doctrine in the statute, especially during a period of rapid technological
change. Beyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and
some of the criteria applicable to it, the courts must be free to adapt the
doctrine to particular situations on a case-by-case basis.” H.R. Rep.
No. 94-1476, supra, at 65-66.

The Senate Committee similarly eschewed a rigid, bright-line approach
to fair use. The Senate Report endorsed the view “that off-the-air record-
ing for convenience” could be considered “fair use” under some circum-
stances, although it then made it clear that it did not intend to suggest
that off-the-air recording for convenience should be deemed fair use under
any circumstances imaginable. S. Rep. No. 94-473, pp. 65-66 (1975).
The latter qualifying statement is quoted by the dissent, post, at 481,
and if read in isolation, would indicate that the Committee intended to con-
demn all off-the-air recording for convenience. Read in context, however,
it is quite clear that that was the farthest thing from the Committee’s
intention.

2“The Committee has amended the first of the criteria to be consid-
ered—‘the purpose and character of the use’—to state explicitly that this
factor includes a consideration of ‘whether such use is of a commercial
nature or is for non-profit educational purposes.’ This amendment is not
intended to be interpreted as any sort of not-for-profit limitation on edu-
cational uses of copyrighted works. It is an express recognition that, as
under the present law, the commercial or non-profit character of an
activity, while not conclusive with respect to fair use, can and should
be weighed along with other factors in fair use decisions.” H.R. Rep.
No. 94-1476, supra, at 66.

Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

that the entire work is reproduced, see §107(3), does not
have its ordinary effect of militating against a finding of fair
use.®
This is not, however, the end of the inquiry because Con-
gress has also directed us to consider “the effect of the use
upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work.” §107(4). The purpose of copyright is to create
incentives for creative effort. Even copying for noncom-
mercial purposes may impair the copyright holder’s ability
_ to obtain the rewards that Congress intended him to have.
But a use that has no demonstrable effect upon the potential
market for, or the value of, the copyrighted work need not
be prohibited in order to protect the author’s incentive to
create. The prohibition of such noncommercial uses would

®Tt has been suggested that “consumptive uses of copyrights by home
VTR users are commercial even if the consumer does not sell the home-
made tape because the consumer will not buy tapes separately sold by the
copyrightholder.” Home Recording of Copyrighted Works: Hearing be-
fore the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration
of Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 97th Cong., 2d Sess.,
pt. 2, p. 1250 (1982) (memorandum of Prof. Laurence H. Tribe). Further-
more, “{t}he error in excusing such theft as noncommercial,” we are told,
“can be seen by simple analogy: jewel theft is not converted into a noncom-
mercial veniality if stolen jewels are simply worn rather than sold.” bid.
The premise and the analogy are indeed simple, but they add nothing to
the argument. The use to which stolen jewelry is put is quite irrelevant in
determining whether depriving its true owner of his present possessory in-
terest in it is venial; because of the nature of the item and the true owner’s
interests in physical possession of it, the law finds the taking objectionable
even if the thief does not use the item at all. Theft of a particular item
of personal property of course may have commercial significance, for the
thief deprives the owner of his right to sell that particular item to any in-
dividual. Time-shifting does not even remotely entail comparable con-
sequences to the copyright owner. Moreover, the time-shifter no more
steals the program by watching it once than does the live viewer, and the
live viewer is no more likely to buy prerecorded videotapes than is the
time-shifter. Indeed, no live viewer would buy a prerecorded videotape if
he did not have access to a VTR.

merely inhibit access to ideas without any countervailing
benefit.*

Thus, although every commercial use of copyrighted mate-
rial is presumptively an unfair exploitation of the monopoly
privilege that belongs to the owner of the copyright, noncom-
mercial uses are a different matter. A challenge to a non-
commercial use of a copyrighted work requires proof either
that the particular use is harmful, or that if it should become
widespread, it would adversely affect the potential market
for the copyrighted work. Actual present harm need not be
shown; such a requirement would leave the copyright holder
with no defense against predictable damage. Nor is it nec-
essary to show with certainty that future harm will result.
What is necessary is a showing by a preponderance of the evi-
dence that some meaningful likelihood of future harm exists.
If the intended use is for commercial gain, that likelihood
may be presumed. But if it is for a noncommercial purpose,
the likelihood must be demonstrated.

In this case, respondents failed to carry their burden with
regard to home time-shifting. The District Court described
respondents’ evidence as follows:

“Plaintiffs’ experts admitted at several points in the
trial that the time-shifting without librarying would re-
sult in ‘not a great deal of harm.’ Plaintiffs’ greatest
concern about time-shifting is with ‘a point of important
philosophy that transcends even commercial judgment.’
They fear that with any Betamax usage, ‘invisible bound-
aries’ are passed: ‘the copyright owner has lost control
over his program.’” 480 F. Supp., at 467.

“Cf. A. Latman, Fair Use of Copyrighted Works (1958), reprinted in
Study No. 14 for the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Copyright Law
Revision, Studies Prepared for the Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks,
and Copyrights, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 30 (1960):

“In certain situations, the copyright owner suffers no substantial harm
from the use of his work. . . . Here again, is the partial marriage between
the doctrine of fair use and the legal maxim de minimus non curat lex.”


--- Page 37 ---
452 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

Later in its opinion, the District Court observed:

“Most of plaintiffs’ predictions of harm hinge on specu-
lation about audience viewing patterns and ratings, a
measurement system which Sidney Sheinberg, MCA’s
president, calls a ‘black art’ because of the significant
level of imprecision involved in the calculations.” Id.,
at 469.*

There was no need for the District Court to say much about
past harm. “Plaintiffs have admitted that no actual harm to
their copyrights has occurred to date.” IJd., at 451.

On the question of potential future harm from time-shifting,
the District Court offered a more detailed analysis of the
evidence. It rejected respondents’ “fear that persons ‘watch-
ing’ the original telecast of a program will not be meas-
ured in the live audience and the ratings and revenues will
decrease,” by observing that current measurement technol-
ogy allows the Betamax audience to be reflected. Id., at
466.% It rejected respondents’ prediction “that live televi-

® See also 480 F. Supp., at 451:

“It should be noted, however, that plaintiffs’ argument is more complicated
and speculative than was the plaintiff’s in Williams & Wilkins. . .. Here,
plaintiffs ask the court to find harm based on many more assumptions. . . .
As is discussed more fully in Part IV infra, some of these assumptions are
based on neither fact nor experience, and plaintiffs admit that they are to
some extent inconsistent and illogical.”

*“There was testimony at trial, however, that Nielsen Ratings has
already developed the ability to measure when a Betamax in a sample
home is recording the program. Thus, the Betamax owner will be meas-
ured as a part of the live audience. The later diary can augment that
measurement with information about subsequent viewing.” Jd., at 466.

In a separate section, the District Court rejected plaintiffs’ suggestion
that the commercial attractiveness of television broadcasts would be dimin-
ished because Betamax owners would use the pause button or fast-forward
control to avoid viewing advertisements:

“It must be remembered, however, that to omit commercials, Betamax
owners must view the program, including the commercials, while record-
ing. To avoid commercials during playback, the viewer must fast-forward


--- Page 38 ---
SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 453
417 Opinion of the Court

sion or movie audiences will decrease as more people watch
Betamax tapes as an alternative,” with the observation that
“{t]here is no factual basis for [the underlying] assumption.”
Ibid.” It rejected respondents’ “fear that time-shifting will
reduce audiences for telecast reruns,” and concluded instead
that “given current market practices, this should aid plain-
tiffs rather than harm them.” Jbid.* And it declared that
respondents’ ‘suggestion that “theater or film rental exhi-
bition of a program will suffer because of time-shift recording
of that program” “lacks merit.” Id., at 467.°

and, for the most part, guess as to when the commercial has passed. For
most recordings, either practice may be too tedious. As defendants’ sur-
vey showed, 92% of the programs were recorded with commercials and
only 25% of the owners fast-forward through them. Advertisers will have
to make the same kinds of judgments they do now about whether persons
viewing televised programs actually watch the advertisements which inter-
rupt them.” Id., at 468.

* “Here plaintiffs assume that people will view copies when they would
otherwise be watching television or going to the movie theater. There is
no factual basis for this assumption. It seems equally likely that Betamax
owners will play their tapes when there is nothing on television they. wish
to see and no movie they want to attend. Defendants’ survey does not
show any negative effect of Betamax ownership on television viewing or
theater attendance.” Jd., at 466.

*“The underlying assumptions here are particularly difficult to accept.
Plaintiffs explain that the Betamax increases access to the original tele-
vised material and that the more people there are in this original audience,
the fewer. people the rerun will attract. Yet current marketing practices,
including the success of syndication, show just the opposite. Today, the
larger the audience for the original telecast, the higher the price plaintiffs
can demand from broadcasters from rerun rights. There is no survey
within the knowledge of this court to show that the rerun audience is com-
prised of persons who have not seen the program. In any event, if ratings
can reflect Betamax recording, original audiences may increase and, given
market practices, this should aid plaintiffs rather than harm them.” bid.

""“This suggestion lacks merit. By definition, time-shift recording en-
tails viewing and erasing, so the program will no longer be on tape when
the later theater run begins. Of course, plaintiffs may fear that the Beta-
max owners will keep the tapes long enough to satisfy all their interest in


--- Page 39 ---
454 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

After completing that review, the District Court restated
its overall conclusion several times, in several different ways.
“Harm from time-shifting is speculative and, at best, mini-
mal.” Ibid. “The audience benefits from the time-shifting
capability have already been discussed. It is not implausible
that benefits could also accrue to plaintiffs, broadcasters, and
advertisers, as the Betamax makes it possible for more per-
sons to view their broadcasts.” Ibid. “No likelihood of
harm was shown at trial, and plaintiffs admitted that there
had been no actual harm to date.” Id., at 468-469. “Testi-
mony: at trial suggested that Betamax may require adjust-
ments in marketing strategy, but it did not establish even
a likelihood of harm.” Jd., at 469. “Television production
by plaintiffs today is more profitable than it has ever been,
and, in five weeks of trial, there was no concrete evidence to
suggest that the Betamax will change the studios’ financial
picture.” Ibid.

The District Court’s conclusions are buttressed by the fact
that to the extent time-shifting expands public access to
freely broadcast television programs, it yields societal bene-
fits. In Community Television of Southern California v.
Gottfried, 459 U. S. 498, 508, n. 12 (1983), we acknowledged
the public interest in making television broadcasting more
available. Concededly, that interest is not unlimited. But
it supports an interpretation of the concept of “fair use” that
requires the copyright holder to demonstrate some likelihood
of harm before he may condemn a private act of time-shifting
as a violation of federal law.

When these factors are all weighed in the “equitable rule of
reason” balance, we must conclude that this record amply

the program and will, therefore, not patronize later theater exhibitions.
To the extent that this practice involves librarying, it is addressed in
section V. C., infra. It should also be noted that there is no evidence to
suggest that the public interest in later theatrical exhibitions of motion
pictures will be reduced any more by Betamax recording than it already is
by the television broadcast of the film.” Jd., at 467.


--- Page 40 ---
SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 455
417 Opinion of the Court

supports the District Court’s conclusion that home time-
shifting is fair use. In light of the findings of the Dis-
trict Court regarding the state of the empirical data, it
is clear that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that
the statute as presently written bars such conduct.®

“The Court of Appeals chose not to engage in any “equitable rule of rea-
son” analysis in this case. Instead, it assumed that the category of “fair
use” is rigidly circumscribed by a requirement that every such use must be
“productive.” It therefore concluded that copying a television program
merely to enable the viewer to receive information or entertainment that
he would otherwise miss because of a personal scheduling conflict could
never be fair use. That understanding of “fair use” was erroneous.

Congress has plainly instructed us that fair use analysis calls for a sensi-
tive balancing of interests. The distinction between “productive” and “un-
productive” uses may be helpful in calibrating the balance, but it cannot be
wholly determinative. Although copying to promote a scholarly endeavor
certainly has a stronger claim to fair use than copying to avoid interrupting
a poker game, the question is not simply two-dimensional. For one thing,
it is not true that all copyrights are fungible. Some copyrights govern ma-
terial with broad potential secondary markets. Such material may well
have a broader claim to protection because of the greater potential for com-
mercial harm. Copying a news broadcast may have a stronger claim to
fair use than copying a motion picture. And, of course, not all uses are
fungible. Copying for commercial gain has a much weaker claim to fair
use than copying for personal enrichment. But the notion of social “pro-
ductivity” cannot be a complete answer to this analysis. A teacher who
copies to prepare lecture notes is clearly productive. But so is a teacher
who copies for the sake of broadening his personal understanding of his
specialty. Ora legislator who copies for the sake of broadening her under-
standing of what her constituents are watching; or a constituent who copies
a news program to help make a decision on how to vote.

Making a copy of a copyrighted work for the convenience of a blind per-
son is expressly identified by the House Committee Report as an example
of fair use, with no suggestion that anything more than a purpose to enter-
tain or to inform need motivate the copying. In a hospital setting, using a
VTR to enable a patient to see programs he would otherwise miss has no
productive purpose other than contributing to the psychological well-being
of the patient. Virtually any time-shifting that increases viewer access
to television programming may result in a comparable benefit. The statu-
tory language does not identify any dichotomy between productive and

Opinion of the Court 464 U.S.

In summary, the record and findings of the District Court
lead us to two conclusions. First, Sony demonstrated a sig-
nificant likelihood that substantial numbers of copyright hold-
ers who license their works for broadeast on free television
would not object to having their broadcasts time-shifted by
private viewers. And second, respondents failed to demon-
strate that time-shifting would cause any likelihood of non-
minimal harm to the potential market for, or the value of,
their copyrighted works. The Betamax is, therefore, capa-
ble of substantial noninfringing uses. Sony’s sale of such
equipment to the general public does not constitute contribu-
tory infringement of respondents’ copyrights.

“The direction of Art. I is that Congress shall have the
power to promote the progress of science and the useful
arts. When, as here, the Constitution is permissive, the
sign of how far Congress has chosen to go can come only
from Congress.” Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram
Corp., 406 U. S. 518, 580 (1972).

One may search the Copyright Act in vain for any sign that
the elected representatives of the millions of people who
watch television every day have made it unlawful to copy a
program for later viewing at home, or have enacted a flat
prohibition against the sale of machines that make such copy-
ing possible.

It may well be that Congress will take a fresh look at this
new technology, just as it so often has examined other inno-
vations in the past. But it is not our job to apply laws that
have not yet been written. Applying the copyright statute,
as it now reads, to the facts as they have been developed
in this case, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be
reversed.

It is so ordered.

417 BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL,
JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, dissenting.

A restatement of the facts and judicial history of this case
is necessary, in my view, for a proper focus upon the issues.
Respondents’ position is hardly so “unprecedented,” ante, at
421, in the copyright law, nor does it really embody a “gross
generalization,” ante, at 436, or a “novel theory of liability,”
ante, at 437, and the like, as the Court, in belittling their
claims, describes the efforts of respondents.

I

The introduction of the home videotape recorder (VTR)
upon the market has enabled millions of Americans to make
recordings of television programs in their homes, for future
and repeated viewing at their own convenience. While this
practice has proved highly popular with owners of television
sets and VTR’s, it understandably has been a matter of con-
cern for the holders of copyrights in the recorded programs.
A result is the present litigation, raising the issues whether
the home recording of a copyrighted television program is an
infringement of the copyright, and, if so, whether the manu-
facturers and distributors of VTR’s are liable as contribu-
tory infringers. I would hope that these questions ultimately
will be considered seriously and in depth by the Congress and
be resolved there, despite the fact that the Court’s decision
today provides little incentive for congressional action. Our
task in the meantime, however, is to resolve these issues as
best we can in the light of ill-fitting existing copyright law.

It is no answer, of course, to refer to and stress, as the Court
does, this Court’s “consistent deference to Congress” when-
ever “major technological innovations” appear. Ante, at
431. Perhaps a better and more accurate description is that
the Court has tended to evade the hard issues when they arise
in the area of copyright law. I see no reason for the Court to
be particularly pleased with this tradition or to continue it.
Indeed, it is fairly clear from the legislative history of the
1976 Act that Congress meant to change the old pattern and

enact a statute that would cover new technologies, as well
as old.

In 1976, respondents Universal City Studios, Inc., and
Walt Disney Productions (Studios) brought this copyright
infringement action in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California against, among others, peti-
tioners Sony Corporation, a Japanese corporation, and Sony
Corporation of America, a New York corporation, the manu-
facturer and distributor, respectively, of the Betamax VTR.
The Studios sought damages, profits, and a wide-ranging
injunction against further sales or use of the Betamax or
Betamax tapes.

The Betamax, like other VTR’s, presently is capable of re-
cording television broadcasts off the air on videotape cassettes,
and playing them back at a later time.! Two kinds of Beta-
max usage are at issue here.’ The first is “time-shifting,”
whereby the user records a program in order to watch it at
a later time, and then records over it, and thereby erases
the program, after a single viewing. The second is “library-

‘The Betamax has three primary components: a tuner that receives tele-
vision (“RF”) signals broadcast over the airwaves; an adapter that con-
verts the RF signals into audio-video signals; and a recorder that places
the audio-video signals on magnetic tape. Sony also manufactures VTR’s
without built-in tuners; these are capable of playing back prerecorded
tapes and recording home movies on videotape, but cannot record off the
air. Since the Betamax has its own tuner, it can be used to record off one
channel while another channel is being watched.

The Betamax is available with auxiliary features, including a timer, a
pause control, and a fast-forward control; these allow Betamax owners to
record programs without being present, to avoid (if they are present)
recording commercial messages, and to skip over commercials while play-
ing back the recording. Videotape is reusable; the user erases its record
by recording over it.

?This case involves only the home recording for home use of television
programs broadcast free over the airwaves. No issue is raised concerning
cable or pay television, or the sharing or trading of tapes.

building,” in which the user records a program in order to
keep it for repeated viewing over a longer term. Sony’s ad-
vertisements, at various times, have suggested that Betamax
users “record favorite shows” or “build a library.” Sony’s
Betamax advertising has never contained warnings about
copyright infringement, although a warning does appear in
the Betamax operating instructions.

The Studios produce copyrighted “movies” and other works
that they release to theaters and license for television broad-
east. They also rent and sell their works on film and on
prerecorded videotapes and videodiscs. License fees for
television broadcasts are set according to audience ratings,
compiled by rating services that do not measure any play-
backs of videotapes. The Studios make the serious claim
that VTR recording may result in a decrease in their revenue
from licensing their works to television and from marketing
them in other ways.

After a 5-week trial, the District Court, with a detailed
opinion, ruled that home VTR recording did not infringe the
Studios’ copyrights under either the Act of Mar. 4, 1909 (1909
Act), 35 Stat. 1075, as amended (formerly codified as 17
U.S. C. §1 et seg.), or the Copyright Revision Act of 1976
(1976 Act), 90 Stat. 2541, 17 U. S. C. §101 et seg. (1982 ed.).°
The District Court also held that even if home VTR recording
were an infringement, Sony could not be held liable under
theories of direct infringement, contributory infringement,
or vicarious liability. Finally, the court concluded that an in-
junction against sales of the Betamax would be inappropriate
even if Sony were liable under one or more of those theories.
480 F. Supp. 429 (1979).

3 At the trial, the Studios proved 32 individual instances where their
copyrighted works were recorded on Betamax VTR’s. Two of these in-
stances occurred after January 1, 1978, the primary effective date of the
1976 Act; all the others occurred while the 1909 Act was still effective.
My analysis focuses primarily on the 1976 Act, but the principles governing
copyright protection for these works are the same under either Act.

BLACKMUN, J., dissenting 464 U.S.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
reversed in virtually every respect. 659 F. 2d 963 (1981).
It held that the 1909 Act and the 1976 Act contained no im-
plied exemption for “home use” recording, that such record-
ing was not “fair use,” and that the use of the Betamax to
record the Studios’ copyrighted works infringed their copy-
rights. The Court of Appeals also held Sony liable for con-
tributory infringement, reasoning that Sony knew and antici-
pated that the Betamax would be used to record copyrighted
material off the air, and that Sony, indeed, had induced,
caused, or materially contributed to the infringing conduct.
The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District
Court for appropriate relief; it suggested that the District
Court could consider the award of damages or a continuing
royalty in lieu of an injunction. Id., at 976.

The Copyright Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, §8, cl. 8,
empowers Congress “To promote the Progress of Science and
useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and In-
ventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and
Discoveries.” This Nation’s initial copyright statute was
passed by the First Congress. Entitled “An Act for the en-
couragement of learning,” it gave an author “the sole right
and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing and vending”
his “map, chart, book or books” for a period of 14 years. Act
of May 31, 1790, §1, 1 Stat. 124. Since then, as the technol-
ogy available to authors for creating and preserving their
writings has changed, the governing statute has changed
with it. By many amendments, and by complete revisions
in 1831, 1870, 1909, and 1976,‘ authors’ rights have been

expanded to provide protection to any “original works of
authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression,” in-
cluding “motion pictures and other audiovisual works.” 17
U.S. C. §102(a) (1982 ed.).®

Section 106 of the 1976 Act grants the owner of a copyright
a variety of exclusive rights in the copyrighted work,’ includ-

5Section 102(a) provides:

“Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original
works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now
known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced,
or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or
device. Works of authorship include the following categories:

“(1) literary works; ,

“(2) musical works, including any accompanying words;

“(3) dramatic works, including any accompanying music;

“(4) pantomimes and choreographic works;

“(5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works;

“(6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works; and

“(1) sound recordings.”

Definitions of terms used in § 102(a)(6) are provided by § 101: “Audiovisual
works” are “works that consist of a series of related images which are in-
trinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines, or devices such as
projectors, viewers, or electronic equipment, together with accompanying
sounds, if any, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as
films or tapes, in which the works are embodied.” And “motion pictures”
are “audiovisual works consisting of a series of related images which, when
shown in succession, impart an impression of motion, together with ac-
companying sounds, if any.” Most commercial television programs, if
fixed on film or tape at the time of broadcast or before, qualify as “audio-
visual works.” Since the categories set forth in § 102(a) are not mutually
exclusive, a particular television program may also qualify for protection as
a dramatic, musical, or other type of work.

‘Section 106 provides:

“Subject to sections 107 through 118, the owner of copyright under this
title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:

“(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;

“(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;

“(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to
the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending;

ing the right “to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or
phonorecords.”’ This grant expressly is made subject to
§§ 107-118, which create a number of exemptions and limita-
tions on the copyright owner’s rights. The most important
of these sections, for present purposes, is § 107; that section
states that “the fair use of a copyrighted work . . . is not an
infringement of copyright.” *

The 1976 Act, like its predecessors,’ does not give the
copyright owner full and complete control over all possible

“(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform
the copyrighted work publicly; and

“(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the indi-
vidual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the
copyrighted work publicly.”

TA “phonorecord” is defined by § 101 as a reproduction of sounds other
than sounds accompanying an audiovisual work, while a “copy” is a re-
production of a work in any form other than a phonorecord.

*Section 107 provides:

“Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the fair use of a copy-
righted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords
or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criti-
cism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for
classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copy-
right. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular
case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

“(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is
of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

“(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

“(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole; and

“(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work.”

Section 101 makes it clear that the four factors listed in this section are
“illustrative and not limitative.”

®The 1976 Act was the product of a revision effort lasting more than
20 years. Spurred by the recognition that “significant developments in
technology and communications” had rendered the 1909 Act inadequate,

uses of his work. Ifthe work is put to some use not enumer-
ated in §106, the use is not an infringement. See Fort-
nightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U.S.
390, 393-395 (1968). Thus, before considering whether
home videotaping comes within the scope of the fair use ex-
emption, one first must inquire whether the practice appears
to violate the exclusive right, granted in the first instance
by § 106(1), “to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or
phonorecords.”
A

Although the word “copies” is in the plural in §106(1),
there can be no question that under the Act the making of
even a single unauthorized copy is prohibited. The Senate
and House Reports explain: “The references to ‘copies or
phonorecords,’ although in the plural, are intended here and
throughout the bill to include the singular (1 U. S. C. §1).”""°

Congress in 1955 authorized the Copyright Office to prepare a series of
studies on all aspects of the existing copyright law. Thirty-four studies
were prepared and presented to Congress. The Register of Copyrights
drafted a comprehensive report with recommendations, House Committee
on the Judiciary, Copyright Law Revision, Report of the Register of Copy-
rights on the General Revision of the U. S. Copyright Law, 87th Cong., 1st
Sess. (Comm. Print 1961) (Register’s 1961 Report), and general revision
bills were introduced near the end of the 88th Congress in 1964. H. R.
11947/S. 3008, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964). The Register issued a second
report in 1965, with revised recommendations. House Committee on the
Judiciary, Copyright Law Revision, pt. 6, Supplementary Report of the
Register of Copyrights on the General Revision of the U. S. Copyright
Law: 1965 Revision Bill, 89th Cong., lst Sess. (Comm. Print 1965) (Regis-
ter’s Supplementary Report). Action on copyright revision was delayed
from 1967 to 1974 by a dispute on cable television, see generally Second
Supplementary Report of the Register of Copyrights on the General Revi-
sion of the U. S. Copyright Law: 1975 Revision Bill, ch. V, pp. 2-26 (Draft

mise led to passage of the present Act in 1976.

“Title 1 U. S. C. §1 provides in relevant part:

text indicates otherwise . . . words importing the plural include the

Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 61 (1976) (1976 House Report). The
Reports then describe the reproduction right established by
§ 106(1):

“(The right ‘to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies
or phonorecords’ means the right to produce a material
object in which the work is duplicated, transcribed, imi-
tated, or simulated in a fixed form from which it can
be ‘perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated,
either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.’
As under the present law, a copyrighted work would
be infringed by reproducing it in whole or in any sub-
stantial part, and by duplicating it exactly or by imita-
tion or simulation.” 1975 Senate Report 58; 1976 House
Report 61.

The making of even a single videotape recording at home falls
within this definition; the VTR user produces a material ob-
ject from which the copyrighted work later can be perceived.
Unless Congress intended a special exemption for the making
of a single copy for personal use, I must conclude that VTR
recording is contrary to the exclusive rights granted by
§ 106(1).

The 1976 Act and its accompanying Reports specify in
some detail the situations in which a single copy of a copy-
righted work may be made without infringement concerns.
Section 108(a), for example, permits a library or archives “to
reproduce no more than one copy or phonorecord of a work”
for a patron, but only under very limited conditions; an entire
work, moreover, can be copied only if it cannot be obtained
elsewhere at a fair price."" § 108(e); see also § 112(a) (broad-

caster may “make no more than one copy or phonorecord of
a particular transmission program,” and only under certain
conditions). In other respects, the making of single copies is
permissible only within the limited confines of the fair use
doctrine. The Senate Report, in a section headed “Single
and multiple copying,” notes that the fair use doctrine would
permit a teacher to make a single copy of a work for use in
the classroom, but only if the work was not a “sizable” one
such as a novel or treatise. 1975 Senate Report 63-64;
accord, 1976 House Report 68-69, 71: Other situations
in which the making of a single copy would be fair use are
described in the House and Senate Reports.” But neither _
the statute nor its legislative history suggests any intent to
create a general exemption for a single copy made for per-
sonal or private use.

Indeed, it appears that Congress considered and rejected
the very possibility of a special private use exemption.’ The
issue was raised early in the revision process, in one of the
studies prepared for Congress under the supervision of the
Copyright Office. A. Latman, Fair Use of Copyrighted
Works (1958), reprinted in Study No. 14 for the Senate Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, Copyright Law Revision, Studies
Prepared for the Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks, and
Copyrights, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1960) (Latman Fair Use
Study). This study found no reported case supporting the
existence of an exemption for private use, although it noted
that “the purpose and nature of a private use, and in some

supervised use of its copying equipment provided that the equipment bears
a notice informing users that “the making of a copy” may violate the copy-
right law. § 108(f)(1).

""For example, “the making of a single copy or phonorecord by an indi-
vidual as a free service for a blind person” would be a fair use, as would “a
single copy reproduction of an excerpt from a copyrighted work by a callig-
rapher for a single client” or “a single reproduction of excerpts from a copy-
righted work by a student calligrapher or teacher in a learning situation.”

cases the small amount taken, might lead a court to apply the
general principles of fair use in such a way as to deny liabil-
ity.” Id.,at 12. After reviewing a number of foreign copy-
right laws that contained explicit statutory exemptions for
private or personal use, id., at 25, Professor Latman outlined
several approaches that a revision bill could take to the gen-
eral issue of exemptions and fair use. One of these was the
adoption of particularized rules to cover specific situations,
including “the field of personal use.” Id., at 33.""

Rejecting the latter alternative, the Register of Copyrights
recommended that the revised copyright statute simply men-
tion the doctrine of fair use and indicate its general scope.
The Register opposed the adoption of rules and exemptions
to cover specific situations,“ preferring, instead, to rely
on the judge-made fair use doctrine to resolve new problems
as they arose. See Register’s 1961 Report 25; Register’s
Supplementary Report 27-28.

The Register’s approach was reflected in the first copy-
right revision bills, drafted by the Copyright Office in 1964.

the fair use doctrine in these situations, of course, would be unnecessary if
the 1976 Act created a general exemption for the making of a single copy.

"" Professor Latman made special mention of the “personal use” issue be-
cause the area was one that “has become disturbed by recent developments

Photoduplication devices may make authors’ and publishers’ groups
apprehensive. The Copyright Charter recently approved by [the Interna-
tional Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers] emphasizes
the concern of authors over ‘private’ uses which, because of technological
developments, are said to be competing seriously with the author’s eco-
nomic interests.” Latman Fair Use Study 33-34.

“The one exemption proposed by the Register, permitting a library to
make a single photocopy of an out-of-print work and of excerpts that a
requester certified were needed for research, met with opposition and was
not included in the bills initially introduced in Congress. See Register’s
1961 Report 26; H. R. 11947/S. 3008, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964); Regis-

These bills, like the 1976 Act, granted the copyright owner
the exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work, sub-
ject only to the exceptions set out in later sections. H. R.
11947/S. 3008, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., §5(a) (1964). The pri-
mary exception was fair use, §6, containing language virtu-
ally identical to § 107 of the 1976 Act. Although the copy-
right revision bills underwent change in many respects from
their first introduction in 1964 to their final passage in 1976,
these portions of the bills did not change. I can con-
clude only that Congress, like the Register, intended to rely
on the fair use doctrine, and not on a per se exemption
for private use, to separate permissible copying from the
impermissible.

*The 1964 bills provided that the fair use of copyrighted material for
purposes “such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholar-
ship, or research” was not an infringement of copyright, and listed four
“factors to be considered” in determining whether any other particular use
was fair. H. R. 11947/S. 3008, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., § 6 (1964). Revised
bills, drafted by the Copyright Office in 1965, contained a fair use provision
merely mentioning the doctrine but not indicating its scope: “Notwith-
standing the provisions of section 106, the fair use of a copyrighted work is
not an infringement of copyright.” H. R. 4847/S. 1006, 89th Cong., ‘Ist

sion to its earlier wording, H. R. Rep. No. 2237, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 5,

in later Congresses. See H. R. 2512/S. 597, 90th Cong., Ist Sess., § 107

for private use, moreover, it said so explicitly. One such
explicit statement appears in §106 itself. The copyright
owner’s exclusive right to perform a copyrighted work, in
contrast to his right to reproduce the work in copies, is lim-
ited. Section 106(4) grants a copyright owner the exclusive
right to perform the work “publicly,” but does not afford the
owner protection with respect to private performances by
others. A motion picture is “performed” whenever its images
are shown or its sounds are made audible. §101. Like “sing-

sible, and because the practice of making personal copies continued after
typewriters and photostat machines were developed, the making of per-
sonal copies by means other than hand copying should be permissible as
well. 203 Ct. Cl., at 84-88, 487 F. 2d, at 1350-1352.

. There appear to me to be several flaws in this reasoning. First, it is
by no means clear that the making of a “hand copy” of an entire work is
permissible; the most that can be said is that there is no reported case
on the subject, possibly because no copyright owner ever thought it worth-
while to sue. See Latman Fair Use Study 11-12; 3 M. Nimmer, Copyright
§ 13.05[E][4}[a] (1983). At least one early treatise asserted that infringe-
ment would result “if an individual made copies for his personal use, even
in his own handwriting, as there is no rule of law excepting manuscript
copies from the law of infringement.” A. Weil, American Copyright Law
§ 1066 (1917). Second, hand copying or even copying by typewriter is self-
limiting. The drudgery involved in making hand copies ordinarily ensures
that only necessary and fairly small portions of a work are taken; it is un-
likely that any user would make a hand copy as a substitute for one that
could be purchased. The harm to the copyright owner from hand copying
thus is minimal. The recent advent of inexpensive and readily available
copying machines, however, has changed the dimensions of the problem.

H. R. 2223 before the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the

Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U. S. 151 (1975), this Court had held that the reception
of a radio or television broadcast was not a “performance” under the 1909
Act. The Court’s “narrow construction” of the word “perform” was “com-
pletely overturned by the [1976 Act] and its broad definition of ‘perform’ in’
section 101.” 1976 House Report 87.

“ A work is performed “publicly” if it takes place “at a place open to the

*One purpose of the exemption for private performances was to permit
the home viewing of lawfully made videotapes. The Register noted in
1961 that “[nJew technical devices will probably make it practical in the
future to reproduce televised motion pictures in the home. We do not be-
lieve the private wse of such a reproduction can or should be precluded by
copyright.” Register’s 1961 Report 30 (ernphasis added). The Register
did not suggest that the private making of a reproduction of a televised
motion picture would be permitted by the copyright law. The Register
later reminded Congress that “{iJn general the concept of ‘performance’
must be distinguished sharply from the reproduction of copies.” Regis-
ter’s Supplementary Report 22.

whether it would apply to works of fiction such as “Gone With the Wind,”

The District Court in this case nevertheless concluded that
the 1976 Act contained an implied exemption for “home-use
recording.” 480 F. Supp., at 444-446. The court relied pri-
marily on the legislative history of a 1971 amendment to the
1909 Act, a reliance that this Court today does not duplicate.
Ante, at 430, n. 11. That amendment, however, was ad-
dressed to the specific problem of commercial piracy of sound
recordings. Act of Oct. 15, 1971, 85 Stat. 391 (1971 Amend-
ment). The House Report on the 1971 Amendment, in a
section entitled “Home Recording,” contains the following
statement:

“In approving the creation of a limited copyright in
sound recordings it is the intention of the Committee
that this limited copyright not grant any broader rights
than are accorded to other copyright proprietors under
the existing title 17. Specifically, it is not the intention
of the Committee to restrain the home recording, from
broadcasts or from tapes or records, of recorded per-

uncontradicted response was that it would apply only in “general terms of
science . . . [and] the useful arts.” 1975 House Hearings 251 (testimony of

not asking . . . for the right to copy ‘Gone With the Wind’”).

“The mention in the Senate and House Reports of situations in which
copies for private use would be permissible under the fair use doctrine—for
example, the making of a free copy for a blind person, 1975 Senate Report
66; 1976 House Report 73, or the “recordings of performances by music stu-
dents for purposes of analysis and criticism,” 1975 Senate Report 63—
would be superfluous as well. See n. 12, supra.

formances, where the home recording is for private use
and with no purpose of reproducing or otherwise capital-
izing commercially on it. This practice is common and
unrestrained today, and the record producers and per-
formers would be in no different position from that of
the owners of copyright in recorded musical composi-
tions over the past 20 years.” H.R. Rep. No. 92-487,

""The following exchange took place during the testimony of Barbara
Ringer, then Assistant Register of Copyrights:

“{Rep.] BIESTER. . . . I can tell you I must have a small pirate in my own
home. My son hasa cassette tape recorder, and as a particular record be-
comes a hit, he will retrieve it onto his little set. . . . [TJhis legislation,
of course, would not point to his activities, would it?

“Miss RINGER. I think the answer is clearly, ‘No, it would not.’ I have
spoken at a couple of seminars on video cassettes lately, and this question
is usually asked: ‘What about the home recorders?” The answer I have
given and will give again is that this is something you cannot control. You
simply cannot control it. My own opinion, whether this is philosophical
dogma or not, is that sooner or later there is going to be a crunch here.
But that is not what this legislation is addressed to, and I do not see the
crunch coming in the immediate future. . . . I do not see anybody going
into anyone’s home and preventing this sort of thing, or forcing legisla-
tion that would engineer a piece of equipment not to allow home taping.”

House Committee on the Judiciary, 92d Cong., Ist Sess., 22-23 (1971)

Shortly before passage of the bill, a colloquy took place between
Representative Kastenmeier, Chairman of the House Subcommittee that

proceedings. In concluding that these statements created
a general exemption for home recording, the District Court,
in my view, paid too little heed to the context in which the
statements were made, and failed to consider the limited pur-
pose of the 1971 Amendment and the structure of the 1909
Act.

Unlike television broadcasts and other types of motion
pictures, sound recordings were not protected by copyright
prior to the passage of the 1971 Amendment. Although the
underlying musical work could be copyrighted, the 1909 Act
provided no protection for a particular performer’s rendition
of the work. Moreover, copyrighted musical works that had
been recorded for public distribution were subject to a “com-
pulsory license”: any person was free to record such a work
upon payment of a 2-cent royalty to the copyright owner.
§1(e), 35 Stat. 1075-1076. While reproduction without pay-
ment of the royalty was an infringement under the 1909 Act,
damages were limited to three times the amount of the un-
paid royalty. §25(e), 35 Stat. 1081-1082; Shapiro, Bernstein
& Co. v. Goody, 248 F. 2d 260, 262-268, 265 (CA2 1957), cert.
denied, 355 U. S. 952 (1958). It was observed that the prac-
tical effect of these provisions was to legalize record piracy.
See S. Rep. No. 92-72, p. 4 (1971); 1971 House Report 2.

In order to suppress this piracy, the 1971 Amendment ex-
tended copyright protection beyond the underlying work and
to the sound recordings themselves. Congress chose, how-
ever, to provide only limited protection: owners of copyright
in sound recordings were given the exclusive right “[t]o re-
produce [their works] and distribute [them] to the public.”

it for her own personal pleasure, for listening pleasure, this use would not
be included under the penalties of this bill?

“Mr. KASTENMEIER. This is not included in the bill. I am glad the
gentleman raises the point.

“On page 7 of the report, under ‘Home Recordings,’ Members will note
that under the bill the same practice which prevails today is called for;
namely, this is considered both presently and under the proposed law to be
fair use. The child does not do this for commercial purposes. This is
made clear in the report.” 117 Cong. Rec. 34748-34749 (1971).

1971 Amendment, § 1(a), 85 Stat. 391 (formerly codified as 17
U.S. C. §1(f)).% This right was merely the right of com-
mercial distribution. See 117 Cong. Rec. 34748-34749 (1971)
(colloquy of Reps. Kazen and Kastenmeier) (“the bill pro-
tects copyrighted material that is duplicated for commercial
purposes only”). .

Against this background, the statements regarding home
recording under the 1971 Amendment appear in a very dif-
ferent light. If home recording was “common and unre-
strained” under the 1909 Act, see 1971 House Report 7, it
was because sound recordings had no copyright protection
and the owner of a copyright in the underlying musical work
could collect no more than a 2-cent royalty plus 6 cents in
damages for each unauthorized use. With so little at stake,
it is not at all surprising that the Assistant Register “d[id]
not see anybody going into anyone’s home and preventing
this sort of thing.” 1971 House Hearings 23.

But the references to home sound recording in the 1971
Amendment’s legislative history demonstrate no congres-
sional intent to create a generalized home-use exemption
from copyright protection. Congress, having recognized
that the 1909 Act had been unsuccessful in controlling home
sound recording, addressed only the specific problem of com-
mercial record piracy. To quote Assistant Register Ringer
again, home use was “not what this legislation [was] ad-
dressed to.” Id., at 22.

“The 1909 Act’s grant of an exclusive right to “copy,” §1(a), was of
no assistance to the owner of a copyright in a sound recording, because a
reproduction of a sound recording was technically considered not to be
a “copy.” See 1971 House Hearings 18 (testimony of Barbara Ringer,
Assistant Register of Copyrights); 1971 Amendment, § 1(e), 85 Stat. 391
(formerly codified as 17 U. S. C. §26) (“For the purposes of [specified
sections, not including § 1(a)], but not for any other purpose, a reproduc-
tion of a (sound recording] shall be considered to be a copy thereof”). This
concept is carried forward into the 1976 Act, which distinguishes between
“copies” and “phonorecords.” See n. 7, supra.

* During consideration of the 1976 Act, Congress, of course, was well
aware of the limited nature of the protection granted to sound recordings

AT4 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
\ BLACKMUN, J., dissenting 464 U.S.

While the 1971 Amendment narrowed the sound record-
ings loophole in then existing copyright law, motion pictures
and other audiovisual works have been accorded full copy-
right protection since at least 1912, see Act of Aug. 24, 1912,
37 Stat. 488, and perhaps before, see Edison v. Lubin, 122 F.
240 (CA8 1903), appeal dism’d, 195 U. S. 625 (1904). Con-
gress continued this protection in the 1976 Act. Unlike the
sound recording rights created by the 1971 Amendment, the
reproduction rights associated with motion pictures under
§106(1) are not limited to reproduction for public distribu-
tion; the copyright owner’s right to reproduce the work ex-
ists independently, and the “mere duplication of a copy may
constitute an infringement even if it is never distributed.”
Register’s Supplementary Report 16; see 1975 Senate Report
57 and 1976 House Report 61. Moreover, the 1976 Act was
intended as a comprehensive treatment of all aspects of copy-
right law. The Reports accompanying the 1976 Act, unlike
the 1971 House Report, contain no suggestion that home-use
recording is somehow outside the scope of this all-inclusive
statute. It was clearly the intent of Congress that no addi-
tional exemptions were to be implied.”

under the 1971 Amendment. See 1975 House Hearings 113 (testimony of
Barbara Ringer, Register of Copyrights) (1971 Amendment “created a
copyright in a sound recording . . . but limited it to the particular situation
of so-called piracy”); id., at 1380 (letter from John Lorenz, Acting Librar-
ian of Congress) (under 1971 Amendment “only the unauthorized reproduc-
tion and distribution to the public of copies of the sound recording is pro-
hibited. Thus, the duplication of sound recordings for private, personal
use and the performance of sound recordings through broadcasting or
other means are outside the scope of the amendment”).

* Representative Kastenmeier, the principal House sponsor of the 1976
revision bill and Chairman of the House Subcommittee that produced it,
made this explicit on the opening day of the House hearings:

“[F}rom time to time, certain areas have not been covered in the bill.

does apply whether or not we specifically deal with a subject or not?...

I therefore find in the 1976 Act no implied exemption to
cover the home taping of television programs, whether it be
for a single copy, for private use, or for home use. Taping a
copyrighted television program is infringement unless it is
permitted by the fair use exemption contained in § 107 of the
1976 Act. I now turn to that issue.

IV
Fair Use

The doctrine of fair use has been called, with some justifi-
cation, “the most troublesome in the whole law of copyright.”
Dellar v. Samuel Goldwyn, Inc., 104 F. 2d-661, 662 (CA2
1939); see Triangle Publications, Inc. v. Knight-Ridder News-
papers, Inc., 626 F. 2d 1171, 1174 (CA5 1980); Meeropol v.
Nizer, 560 F. 2d 1061, 1068 (CA2 1977), cert. denied, 434
U. S. 1013 (1978). Although courts have constructed lists of
factors to be considered in determining whether a particular
use is fair,” no fixed criteria have emerged by which that

with one way or the other. The code, title 17, will cover it. So we have
made a conscientious decision even by omission.

. By virtue of passing this bill, we will deal with every issue.
Whether we deal with it completely or not for the purpose of resolving the
issues involved is the only question, not whether it has dealt with the four
corners of the bill because the four corners of the bill will presume to deal
with everything in copyright.” Id., at 115.

""The precise phrase “fair use” apparently did not enter the case law
until 1869, see Lawrence v. Dana, 15 F. Cas. 26, 60 (No. 8,136) (CC
Mass.), but the doctrine itself found early expression in Folsom v. Marsh,
9 F. Cas, 342 (No. 4,901) (CC Mass. 1841). Justice Story was faced there
with the “intricate and embarrassing questiofn]” whether a biography con-
taining copyrighted letters was “a justifiable use of the original materials,
such as the law recognizes as no infringement of the copyright of the plain-
tiffs.” Id., at 344,348. In determining whether the use was permitted, it
was necessary, said Justice Story, to consider “the nature and objects of
the selections made, the quantity and value of the materials used, and the
degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or

determination can be made. This Court thus far has pro-
vided no guidance; although fair use issues have come here
twice, on each occasion the Court was equally divided and
no opinion was forthcoming. Williams & Wilkins Co. v.
United States, 203 Ct. Cl. 74, 487 F. 2d 1845 (1978), aff’d, 420
U. S. 376 (1975); Benny v. Loew’s Inc., 239 F. 2d 532 (CA9
1956), aff’d sub nom. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
Loew’s Inc., 356 U. S. 48 (1958).

Nor did Congress provide definitive rules when it codified
the fair use doctrine in the 1976 Act; it simply incorporated
a list of factors “to be considered”: the “purpose and charac-
ter of the use,” the “nature of the copyrighted work,” the
“amount and substantiality of the portion used,” and, perhaps
the most important, the “effect of the use upon the potential
market for or value of the copyrighted work” (emphasis sup-
plied). §107. No particular weight, however, was assigned
to any of these, and the list was not intended to be exclusive.
The House and Senate Reports explain that §107 does no
more than give “statutory recognition” to the fair use doc-
trine; it was intended “to restate the present judicial doctrine
of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way.”
1976 House Report 66. See 1975 Senate Report 62; S. Rep.
No. 93-983, p. 116 (1974); H. R. Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st
Sess., 32 (1967); H. R. Rep. No. 2237, 89th Cong., 2d Sess.,

supersede the objects, of the original work. . .. Much must, in such cases,
depend upon the nature of the new work, the value and extent of the
copies, and the degree in which the original authors may be injured
thereby.” Id., at 348-349,

Similar lists were compiled by later courts. See, e. g., Tennessee Fabri-
cating Co. v. Moultrie Mfg. Co., 421 F. 2d 279, 283 (CA5), cert. denied,
398 U. S. 928 (1970); Mathews Conveyer Co. v. Palmer-Bee Co., 185 F. 2d
78, 85 (CA6 1948); Columbia Pictures Corp. v. National Broadcasting Co.,
137 F. Supp. 348 (SD Cal. 1955); Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. P. F. Collier
& Son Co., 26 USPQ 40, 43 (SDNY 1934); Hill v. Whalen & Martell, Inc.,
220 F. 359, 360 (SDNY 1914).

A

Despite this absence of clear standards, the fair use doc-
trine plays a crucial role in the law of copyright. The pur-
pose of copyright protection, in the words of the Constitu-
tion, is to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.”
Copyright is based on the belief that by granting authors the
exclusive rights to reproduce their works, they are given an
incentive to create, and that “encouragement of individual
effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public
welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in ‘Sci-
ence and the useful Arts.’” Mazer v. Stein, 347 U. 8. 201,
219 (1954). The monopoly created by copyright thus re-
wards the individual author in order to benefit the public.
Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U. S., at 156;
Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U.S. 123, 127-128 (1932); see
H. R. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1909).

There are situations, nevertheless, in which strict enforce-
ment of this monopoly would inhibit the very “Progress of
Science and useful Arts” that copyright is intended to pro-
mote. An obvious example is the researcher or scholar
whose own work depends on the ability to refer to and to
quote the work of prior scholars. Obviously, no author could
create a new work if he were first required to repeat the re-
search of every author who had gone before him.” The
scholar, like the ordinary user, of course could be left to bar-
gain with each copyright owner for permission to quote from
or refer to prior works. But there is a crucial difference be-
tween the scholar and the ordinary user. When the ordinary
user decides that the owner’s price is too high, and forgoes
use of the work, only the individual is the loser. When the
scholar forgoes the use of a prior work, not only does his own

“The world goes ahead because each of us builds on the work of our
predecessors. ‘A dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant can see far-
ther than the giant himself.’” Chafee, Reflections on the Law of Copy-
right: I, 45 Colum. L. Rev. 508, 511 (1945).

work suffer, but the public is deprived of his contribution to
knowledge. The scholar’s work, in other words, produces
external benefits from which everyone profits. In such a
case, the fair use doctrine acts as a form of subsidy—albeit at
the first author’s expense—to permit the second author to
make limited use of the first author’s work for the public
good. See Latman Fair Use Study 31; Gordon, Fair Use as
Market Failure: A Structural Analysis of the Betamax Case
and its Predecessors, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 1600, 1630 (1982).

A similar subsidy may be appropriate in a range of areas
other than pure scholarship. The situations in which fair use
is most commonly recognized are listed in § 107 itself; fair use
may be found when a work is used “for purposes such as criti-
cism, comment, news reporting, teaching, . . . scholarship,
or research.” The House and Senate Reports expand on this
list somewhat,” and other examples may be found in the case
law.” Each of these uses, however, reflects a common
theme: each is a productive use, resulting in some added ben-
efit to the public beyond that produced by the first author’s
work."" The fair use doctrine, in other words, permits works

* Quoting from the Register’s 1961 Report, the Senate and House Re-
ports give examples of possible fair uses:
“‘quotation of excerpts in a review or criticism for purposes of illustration
or comment; quotation of short passages in a scholarly or technical work,
for illustration or clarification of the author’s observations; use in a parody
of some of the content of the work parodied; summary of an address or arti-
cle, with brief quotations, in a news report; reproduction by a library of a
portion of a work to replace part of a damaged copy; reproduction by a
teacher or student of a small part of a work to illustrate a lesson; reproduc-
tion of a work in legislative or judicial proceedings or reports; incidental
and fortuitous reproduction, in a newsreel! or broadcast, of a work located
in the scene of an event being reported.’” 1975 Senate Report 61-62; 1976
House Report 65.

® See, e. g., Triangle Publications, Inc. v. Knight-Ridder Newspapers,
Inc., 626 F, 2d 1171 (CA5 1980) (comparative advertising).

"" Professor Seltzer has characterized these lists of uses as “reflect[ing]
what in fact the subject matter of fair use has in the history of its adjudica-
tion consisted in: it has always had to do with the use by a second author of

to be used for “socially laudable purposes.” See Copyright
Office, Briefing Papers on Current Issues, reprinted in 1975
House Hearings 2051, 2055. I am aware of no case in which
the reproduction of a copyrighted work for the sole benefit of
the user has been held to be fair use.”

I do not suggest, of course, that every productive use is a
fair use. A finding of fair use still must depend on the facts
of the individual case, and on whether, under the circum-
stances, it is reasonable to expect the user to bargain with
the copyright owner for use of the work. The fair use doc-
trine must strike a balance between the dual risks created by
the copyright system: on the one hand, that depriving au-
thors of their monopoly will reduce their incentive to create,
and, on the other, that granting authors a complete monopoly

24 (1978) (emphasis removed). He distinguishes “the mere reproduction
of a work in order to use it for its intrinsic purpose—to make what might be
called the ‘ordinary’ use of it.” When copies are made for “ordinary” use
of the work, “ordinary infringement has customarily been triggered, not
notions of fair use” (emphasis in original). Ibid. See also 3M. Nimmer,

1345 (1973), aff’d by an equally divided Court, 420 U. S. 376 (1975), in-
volved the photocopying of scientific journal articles; the Court of Claims
stressed that the libraries performing the copying were “devoted solely to
the advancement and dissemination of medical knowledge,” 203 Ct. Cl., at
91, 487 F. 2d, at 1354, and that “medical science would be seriously hurt if
such library photocopying were stopped.” Id., at 95, 487 F. 2d, at 1356.

The issue of library copying is now covered by §108 of the 1976 Act.
That section, which Congress regarded as “authoriz[ing] certain photo-
copying practices which may not qualify as a fair use,” 1975 Senate Report
67; 1976 House Report 74, permits the making of copies only for “private
study, scholarship, or research.” §§ 108(d)(1) and (e)(1).

necessarily a flexible one, and the endless variety of situa-
tions that may arise precludes the formulation of exact rules.
But when a user reproduces an entire work and uses it for its
original purpose, with no added benefit to the public, the doc-
trine of fair use usually does not apply. There is then no
need whatsoever to provide the ordinary user with a fair use
subsidy at the author’s expense.

The making of a videotape recording for home viewing is
an ordinary rather than a productive use of the Studios’ copy-
righted works. The District Court found that “Betamax
owners use the copy for the same purpose as the original.
They add nothing of their own.” 480 F. Supp., at 453. Al-
though applying the fair use doctrine to home VTR record-
ing, as Sony argues, may increase public access to material
broadcast free over the public airwaves, I think Sony’s argu-
ment misconceives the nature of copyright. Copyright gives
the author a right to limit or even to cut off access to his
work. Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U. S., at 127. AVTR
recording creates no public benefit sufficient to justify limit-
ing this right. Nor is this right extinguished by the copy-
right owner’s choice to make the work available over the
airwaves. Section 106 of the 1976 Act grants the copy-
right owner the exclusive right to control the performance
and the reproduction of his work, and the fact that he has
licensed a single television performance is really irrelevant
to the existence of his right to control its reproduction. Al-
though a television broadcast may be free to the viewer, this
fact is equally irrelevant; a book borrowed from the public
library may not be copied any more freely than a book that is
purchased.

It may be tempting, as, in my view, the Court today is
tempted, to stretch the doctrine of fair use so as to permit
unfettered use of this new technology in order to increase ac-

other, that the world may not be deprived of improvements, nor the
progress of the arts be retarded.” Sayre v. Moore, as set forth in Cary

cess to television programming. But such an extension risks
eroding the very basis of copyright law, by depriving authors
of control over their works and consequently of their incen-
tive to create.“ Even in the context of highly productive
educational uses, Congress has avoided this temptation; in
passing the 1976 Act, Congress made it clear that off-the-air
videotaping was to be permitted only in very limited situa-
tions. See 1976 House Report 71; 1975 Senate Report 64.
And, the Senate Report adds, “[t]he committee does not in-
tend to suggest . . . that off-the-air recording for convenience
would under any circumstances, be considered ‘fair use.’”
Id., at 66. I cannot disregard these admonitions.

B

I recognize, nevertheless, that there are situations where
permitting even an unproductive use would have no effect on
the author’s incentive to create, that is, where the use would
not affect the value of, or the market for, the author’s work.
Photocopying an old newspaper clipping to send to a friend

“This point was brought home repeatedly by the Register of Copy-
rights. Mentioning the “multitude of technological developments” since
passage of the 1909 Act, including “remarkable developments in the use
of video tape,” Register’s Supplementary Report xiv—xv, the Register
cautioned:

“T realize, more clearly now than I did in 1961, that the revolution in
communications has brought with it a serious challenge to the author’s
copyright. This challenge comes not only from the ever-growing commer-
cial interests who wish to use the author’s works for private gain. An
equally serious attack has come from people with a sincere interest in the
public welfare who fully recognize . . . ‘that the real heart of civiliza-
tion . . . owes its existence to the author’; ironically, in seeking to make
the author’s works widely available by freeing them from copyright re-
strictions, they fail to realize that they are whittling away the very thing
that nurtures authorship in the first place. An accommodation among con-
flicting demands must be worked out, true enough, but not by denying the
fundamental constitutional directive: to encourage cultural progress by
securing the author’s exclusive rights to him for a limited time.” Id.,
at xv; see 1975 House Hearings 117 (testimony of Barbara Ringer, Regis-
ter of Copyrights).

may be an example; pinning a quotation on one’s bulletin
board may be another. In each of these cases, the effect. on
the author is truly de minimis. Thus, even though these
uses provide no benefit to the public at large, no purpose is
served by preserving the author’s monopoly, and the use may
be regarded as fair.

Courts should move with caution, however, in depriving
authors of protection from unproductive “ordinary” uses.
As has been noted above, even in the case of a productive
use, §107(4) requires consideration of “the effect of the use
upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work” (emphasis added). “{A] particular use which may
seem to have little or no economic impact on the author’s
rights today can assume tremendous importance in times to
come.” Register’s Supplementary Report 14. Although
such a use may seem harmless when viewed in isolation,
“Cilsolated instances of minor infringements, when multiplied
many times, become in the aggregate a major inroad on copy-
right that must be prevented.” 1975 Senate Report 65.

I therefore conclude that, at least when the proposed use
is an unproductive one, a copyright owner need prove only a
potential for harm to the market for or the value of the copy-
righted work. See 3M. Nimmer, Copyright § 13.05[E][4][c],
p. 18-84 (1983). Proof of actual harm, or even probable
harm, may be impossible in an area where the effect of a new
technology is speculative, and requiring such proof would
present the “real danger . . . of confining the scope of an au-
thor’s rights on the basis of the present technology so that, as
the years go by, his copyright loses much of its value because
of unforeseen technical advances.” Register’s Supplemen-
tary Report 14. Infringement thus would be found if the
copyright owner demonstrates a reasonable possibility that
harm will result from the proposed use. When the use is one
that creates no benefit to the public at large, copyright pro-
tection should not be denied on the basis that a new technol-
ogy that may result in harm has not yet done so.

SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 483
417 BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

The Studios have identified a number of ways in which
VTR recording could damage their copyrights. VTR re-
cording could reduce their ability to market their works in
movie theaters and through the rental or sale of prerecorded
videotapes or videodiscs; it also could reduce their rerun au-
dience, and consequently the license fees available to them
for repeated showings. Moreover, advertisers may be will-
ing to pay for only “live” viewing audiences, if they believe
VTR viewers will delete commercials or if rating services are
unable to measure VTR use; if this is the ease, VTR record-
ing could reduce the license fees the Studios are able to
charge even for first-run showings. Library-building may
raise the potential for each of the types of harm identified
by the Studios, and time-shifting may raise the potential for
substantial harm as well.*

Although the District Court found no likelihood of harm
from VTR use, 480 F. Supp., at 468, I conclude that it ap-
plied an incorrect substantive standard and misallocated the

® A VTR owner who has taped a favorite movie for repeated viewing will
be less likely to rent or buy a tape containing the same movie, watch a tele-
vised rerun, or pay to see the movie at a theater. Although time-shifting
may not replace theater or rerun viewing or the purchase of prerecorded
tapes or discs, it may well replace rental usage; a VTR user who has re-
corded a first-run movie for later viewing will have no need to rent a copy
when he wants to see it. Both library-builders and time-shifters may
avoid commercials; the library-builder may use the pause control to record
without them, and all users may fast-forward through commercials on
playback.

The Studios introduced expert testimony that both time-shifting and
librarying would tend to decrease their revenue from copyrighted works.
See 480 F. Supp., at 440. The District Court’s findings also show substan-
tial library-building and avoidance of commercials. Both sides submitted
surveys showing that the average Betamax user owns between 25 and 32
tapes. The Studios’ survey showed that at least 40% of users had more
than 10 tapes in a “library”; Sony’s survey showed that more than 40% of
users planned to view their tapes more than once; and both sides’ surveys
showed that commercials were avoided at least 25% of the time. Id., at

burden of proof. The District Court reasoned that the Stu-
dios had failed to prove that library-building would occur “to
any significant extent,” id., at 467; that the Studios’ prere-
corded videodises could compete with VTR recordings and
were “arguably . . . more desirable,” ibid.; that it was “not
clear that movie audiences will decrease,” id., at 468; and
that the practice of deleting commercials “may be too te-
dious” for many viewers, ibid. To the extent any decrease
in advertising revenues would occur, the court concluded that
the Studios had “marketing alternatives at hand to recoup
some of that predicted loss.” Id., at 452. Because the Stu-
dios’ prediction of harm was “based on so many assumptions
and on a system of marketing which is rapidly changing,” the
court was “hesitant to identify ‘probable effects’ of home-use
copying.” Ibid.

The District Court’s reluctance to engage in prediction
in this area is understandable, but, in my view, the court
was mistaken in concluding that the Studios should bear the
risk created by this uncertainty. The Studios have demon-
strated a potential for harm, which has not been, and
could not be, refuted at this early stage of technological
development.

The District Court’s analysis of harm, moreover, failed to
consider the effect of VTR recording on “the potential mar-
ket for or the value of the copyrighted work,” as required by
§107(4).* The requirement that a putatively infringing use

of a copyrighted work, to be “fair,” must not impair a “poten-
tial” market for the work has two implications. First, an
infringer cannot prevail merely by demonstrating that the
copyright holder suffered no net harm from the infringer’s ac-
tion. Indeed, even a showing that the infringement has re-
sulted in a net benefit to the copyright holder will not suffice.
Rather, the infringer must demonstrate that he had not im-
paired the copyright holder’s ability to demand compensation
from (or to deny access to) any group who would otherwise be
willing to pay to see or hear the copyrighted work. Second,
the fact that a given market for a copyrighted work would not
be available to the copyright holder were it not for the in-
fringer’s activities does not permit the infringer to exploit
that market without compensating the copyright holder.
See Iowa State University Research Foundation, Inc. v.
American Broadcasting Cos., 621 F, 2d 57 (CA2 1980). _

In this case, the Studios and their amici demonstrate that
the advent of the VTR technology created a potential market
for their copyrighted programs. That market consists of
those persons who find it impossible or inconvenient to watch
the programs at the time they are broadcast, and who wish to
watch them at other times. These persons are willing to pay.
for the privilege of watching copyrighted work at their con-
venience, as is evidenced by the fact that they are willing to
pay for VTR’s and tapes; undoubtedly, most also would be
willing to pay some kind of royalty to copyright holders.
The Studios correctly argue that they have been deprived of
the ability to exploit this sizable market.

It is thus apparent from the record and from the findings of
the District Court that time-shifting does have a substantial

owner’s potential market for and value of his work”); Encyclopaedia Bri-
tannica Educational Corp. v. Crooks, 542 F. Supp. 1156, 1173 (WDNY
1982) (“[T]he concern here must be focused on a copyrighted work’s poten-
tial market. It is perfectly possible that plaintiffs’ profits would have
been greater, but for the kind of videotaping in question”) (emphasis in
original).

adverse effect upon the “potential market for” the Studios’
copyrighted works. Accordingly, even under the formula-
tion of the fair use doctrine advanced by Sony, time-shifting
cannot be deemed a fair use.

vV
Contributory Infringement

From the Studios’ perspective, the consequences of home
VTR recording are the same as if a business had taped the
Studios’ works off the air, duplicated the tapes, and sold
or rented them to members of the public for home viewing.
The distinction is that home VTR users do not record for
commercial advantage; the commercial benefit accrues to the
manufacturer and distributors of the Betamax. I thus must
proceed to discuss whether the manufacturer and distribu-
tors can be held contributorily liable if the product they sell
is used to infringe.

It is well established that liability for copyright infringe-
ment can be imposed on persons other than those who actu-
ally carry out the infringing activity. Kalem Co. v. Harper
Brothers, 222 U. S. 55, 62-68 (1911); 3 M. Nimmer, Copy-
right §12.04[A] (1983); see Twentieth Century Music Corp.
v. Aiken, 422 U.S., at 160, n. 11; Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle
Realty Co., 283 U. S. 191, 198 (1931). Although the liability
provision of the 1976 Act provides simply that “[aJnyone who
violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
. .. is an infringer of the copyright,” 17 U.S. C. §501(a)
(1982 ed.), the House and Senate Reports demonstrate that
Congress intended to retain judicial doctrines of contributory
infringement. 1975 Senate Report 57; 1976 House Report
61.""

""This intent is manifested further by provisions of the 1976 Act that
exempt from liability persons who, while not participating directly in any
infringing activity, could otherwise be charged with contributory infringe-
ment. See §108(f)(1) (library not liable “for the unsupervised use of re-

The doctrine of contributory copyright infringement, how-
ever, is not well defined. One of the few attempts at defini-
tion appears in Gershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Art-
ists Management, Inc., 443 F. 2d 1159 (CA2 1971). In that
case the Second Circuit stated that “one who, with knowl-
edge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially
contributes to the infringing conduct of another, may be held
liable as a ‘contributory’ infringer.” Jd., at 1162 (footnote
omitted). While I have no quarrel with this general state-
ment, it does not easily resolve the present case; the District
Court and the Court of Appeals, both purporting to apply it,
reached diametrically opposite results.

A

In absolving Sony from liability, the District Court rea-
soned that Sony had no direct involvement with individual
Betamax users, did not participate in any off-the-air copying,
and did not know that such copying was an infringement of
the Studios’ copyright. 480 F. Supp., at 460. I agree with
the Gershwin court that contributory liability may be im-
posed even when the defendant has no formal control over
the infringer. The defendant in Gershwin was a concert pro-
moter operating through local concert associations that it
sponsored; it had no formal control over the infringing per-
formers themselves. 443 F. 2d, at 1162-1168. See also
Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U. S., at 160,
n. 11. Moreover, a finding of contributory infringement has
never depended on actual knowledge of particular instances
of infringement; it is sufficient that the defendant have rea-
son to know that infringement is taking place. 443 F. 2d,

at 1162; see Screen Gems-Columbia Music, Inc. v. Mark-Ft
Records, Inc., 256 F. Supp. 899 (SDNY 1966).” In the so-
called “dance hall” cases, in which questions of contributory
infringement arise with some frequency, proprietors of en-
tertainment establishments routinely are held liable for un-
authorized performances on their premises, even when they
have no knowledge that copyrighted works are being per-
formed. In effect, the proprietors in those cases are charged
with constructive knowledge of the performances.”

""In Screen Gems, on which the Gershwin court relied, the court held
that liability could be imposed on a shipper of unauthorized “bootleg”
records and a radio station that broadcast advertisements of the records,
provided they knew or should have known that the records were infring-
ing. The court concluded that the records’ low price and the manner in
which the records were marketed could support a finding of “constructive
knowledge” even if actual knowledge were not shown.

® See, e. g., Famous Music Corp. v. Bay State Harness Horse Racing &
Breeding Assn., Inc., 554 F. 2d 1213 (CA1 1977); Dreamland Ball Room,
Inc. v. Shapiro, Bernstein & Co., 36 F. 2d 354 (CA7 1929); M. Witmark &
Sons v. Tremont Social & Athletic Club, 188 F. Supp. 787, 790 (Mass.
1960); see also Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U. 8. 151,

(1981); 3 M. Nimmer, Copyright § 12.04[A], p. 12-35 (1983).

Courts have premised liability in these cases on the notion that the de-
fendant had the ability to supervise or control the infringing activities, see,
e. g., Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304, 307
(CA2 1963); KECA Music, Inc. v. Dingus McGee’s Co., 432 F. Supp. 72, 74
(WD Mo. 1977). This notion, however, is to some extent fictional; the
defendant cannot escape liability by instructing the performers not to play
copyrighted music, or even by inserting a provision to that effect into the
performers’ contract. Famous Music Corp. v. Bay State Harness Horse
Racing & Breeding Assn., Inc., 554 F. 2d, at 1214-1215; KECA Music,
Inc. v. Dingus McGee’s Co., 432 F. Supp., at 75; Shapiro, Bernstein & Co.
v. Veltin, 47 F. Supp. 648, 649 (WD La. 1942). Congress expressly re-
jected a proposal to exempt proprietors from this type of liability under the
1976 Act. See 1975 Senate Report 141-142; 1976 House Report 159-160;
1975 House Hearings 1812-1813 (testimony of Barbara Ringer, Register of
Copyrights); id., at 1818 (colloquy between Rep. Pattison and Barbara
Ringer).

The Court’s attempt to distinguish these cases on the ground of “con-
trol,” ante, at 437, is obviously unpersuasive. The direct infringer ordi-

Nor is it necessary that the defendant be aware that the
infringing activity violates the copyright laws. Section
504(c)(2) of the 1976 Act provides for a reduction in statutory
damages when an infringer proves he “was not aware and
had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an
infringement of copyright,” but the statute establishes no
general exemption for those who believe their infringing
activities are legal. Moreover, such an exemption would be
meaningless in a case such as this, in which prospective relief
is sought; once a court has established that the copying at
issue is infringement, the defendants are necessarily aware of
that fact for the future. It is undisputed in this case that
Sony had reason to know the Betamax would be used by
some owners to tape copyrighted works off the air. See 480
F. Supp., at 459-460.

The District Court also concluded that Sony had not
caused, induced, or contributed materially to any infringing
activities of Betamax owners. Id., at 460. Ina case of this
kind, however, causation can be shown indirectly; it does not
depend on evidence that particular Betamax owners relied
on particular advertisements. In an analogous case decided
just two Terms ago, this Court approved a lower court’s con-
clusion that liability for contributory trademark infringement
could be imposed on a manufacturer who.“suggested, even by
implication” that a retailer use the manufacturer’s goods to
infringe the trademark of another. Inwood Laboratories,
Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U. S. 844, 851 (1982); see
id., at 860 (opinion concurring in result). I think this stand-
ard is equally appropriate in the copyright context.

The District Court found that Sony has advertised the
Betamax as suitable for off-the-air recording of “favorite
shows,” “novels for television,” and “classic movies,” 480 F.
Supp., at 436, with no visible warning that such recording

narily is not employed by the person held liable; instead, he is an independ-
ent contractor. Neither is he always an agent of the person held liable;
Screen Gems makes this apparent.

could constitute copyright infringement. It is only with the
aid of the Betamax or some other VTR, that it is possible
today for home television viewers to infringe copyright by
recording off-the-air. Off-the-air recording is not only a
foreseeable use for the Betamax, but indeed is its intended
use. Under the circumstances, I agree with the Court of
Appeals that if off-the-air recording is an infringement of
copyright, Sony has induced and materially contributed to
the infringing conduct of Betamax owners.”

B

Sony argues that the manufacturer or seller of a product
used to infringe is absolved from liability whenever the prod-
uct can be put to any substantial noninfringing use. Brief
for Petitioners 41-42. The District Court so held, borrowing
the “staple article of commerce” doctrine governing liability
for contributory infringement of patents. See 35 U.S. C.
§271.“ This Court today is much less positive. See ante,

“My conclusion respecting contributory infringement does not include
the retailer defendants. The District Court found that one of the retailer
defendants had assisted in the advertising campaign for the Betamax, but
made no other findings respecting their knowledge of the Betamax’s in-
tended uses. I do not agree with the Court of Appeals, at least on this
record, that the retailers “are sufficiently engaged in the enterprise to be
held accountable,” 659 F. 2d 963, 976 (1981). In contrast, the advertising
agency employed to promote the Betamax was far more actively engaged
in the advertising campaign, and petitioners have not argued that the
agency’s liability differs in any way from that of Sony Corporation and
Sony Corporation of America.

“The “staple article of commerce” doctrine protects those who manufac-
ture products incorporated into or used with patented inventions—for ex-
ample, the paper and ink used with patented printing machines, Henry v.
A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1(1912), or the dry ice used with patented refrig-
eration systems, Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., 283 U. 8. 27
(1931). Because a patent holder has the right to control the use of the
patented item as well as its manufacture, see Motion Picture Patents Co.
v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502, 509-510 (1917); 35 U.S. C.
§ 271(a), such protection for the manufacturer of the incorporated product
is necessary to prevent patent holders from extending their monopolies by

at 440-442. I do not agree that this technical judge-made
doctrine of patent law, based in part on considerations irrele-
vant to the field of copyright, see generally Dawson Chemi-
cal Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U. S. 176, 187-199 (1980),
should be imported wholesale into copyright law. Despite
their common constitutional source, see U. S. Const., Art. I,
§8, cl. 8, patent and copyright protections have not devel-
oped in a parallel fashion, and this Court in copyright cases in
the past has borrowed patent concepts only sparingly. See
Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U. S. 389, 345-346 (1908).

I recognize, however, that many of the concerns underly-
ing the “staple article of commerce” doctrine are present in
copyright law as well. As the District Court noted, if liabil-
ity for contributory infringement were imposed on the manu-
facturer or seller of every product used to infringe—a type-
writer, a.camera, a photocopying machine—the “wheels of
commerce” would be blocked. 480 F. Supp., at 461; see also
Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S., at 62.

I therefore conclude that if a significant portion of the
product’s use is noninfringing, the manufacturers and sellers
cannot be held contributorily liable for the product’s infring-
ing uses. See ante, at 440-441. If virtually all of the prod-
uct’s use, however, is to infringe, contributory liability may
be imposed; if no one would buy the product for noninfringing
purposes alone, it is clear that the manufacturer is purposely
profiting from the infringement, and that liability is appro-
priately imposed. In such a case, the copyright owner’s
monopoly would not be extended beyond its proper bounds;
the manufacturer of such a product contributes to the infring-
ing activities of others and profits directly thereby, while

suppressing competition in unpatented components and supplies suitable
for use with the patented item. See Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm &
Haas Co., 448 U.S. 176, 197-198 (1980). The doctrine of contributory
patent infringement has been the subject of attention by the courts and by
Congress, see id., at 202-212, and has been codified since 1952, 66 Stat.
792, but was never mentioned during the copyright law revision process as
having any relevance to contributory copyright infringement.

providing no benefit to the public sufficient to justify the
infringement.

The Court of Appeals concluded that Sony should be held
liable for contributory infringement, reasoning that “{v]Jideo-
tape recorders are manufactured, advertised, and sold for the
primary purpose of reproducing television programming,”
and “[vlirtually all television programming is copyrighted
material.” 659 F.2d, at 975. While I agree with the first of
these propositions,” the second, for me, is problematic. The
key question is not the amount of television programming
that is copyrighted, but rather the amount of VTR usage that
is infringing.“ Moreover, the parties and their amici have
argued vigorously about both the amount of television pro-
gramming that is covered by copyright and the amount for
which permission to copy has been given. The proportion of
VTR recording that is infringing is ultimately a question of
fact,“ and the District Court specifically declined to make

“ Although VTR’s also may be used to watch prerecorded video cassettes
and to make home motion pictures, these uses do not require a tuner such
as the Betamax contains. Seen. 1, supra. The Studios do not object to
Sony’s sale of VTR’s without tuners. Brief for Respondents 5,n.9. In
considering the noninfringing uses of the Betamax, therefore, those uses
that would remain possible without the Betamax’s built-in tuner should not
be taken into account.

®Noninfringing uses would include, for example, recording works that
are not protected by copyright, recording works that have entered the
public domain, recording with permission of the copyright owner, and, of
course, any recording that qualifies as fair use. See, e. g., Bruzzone v.
Miller Brewing Co., 202 USPQ 809 (ND Cal. 1979) (use of home VTR for
market research studies).

“Sony asserts that much or most television broadcasting is available for
home recording because (1) no copyright owner other than the Studios has
brought an infringement action, and (2) much televised material is ineligi-
ble for copyright protection because videotapes of the broadcasts are not
kept. The first of these assertions is irrelevant; Sony’s liability does not
turn on the fact that only two copyright owners thus far have brought suit.
The amount of infringing use must be determined through consideration of
the television market as a whole. Sony’s second assertion is based on a
faulty premise; the Copyright Office permits audiovisual works transmit-

findings on the “percentage of legal versus illegal home-use
recording.” 480 F. Supp., at 468. In light of my view of the
law, resolution of this factual question is essential. I there-
fore would remand the case for further consideration of this
by the District Court.

VI

The Court has adopted an approach very different from the
one I have outlined. It is my view that the Court’s approach
alters dramatically the doctrines of fair use and contributory
infringement as they have been developed by Congress and
the courts. Should Congress choose to respond to the
Court’s decigion, the old doctrines can be resurrected. As
it stands, however, the decision today erodes much of the
coherence that these doctrines have struggled to achieve.

The Court’s disposition of the case turns on its conclusion
that time-shifting is a fair use. Because both parties agree
that time-shifting is the primary use of VTR’s, that conclu-
sion, if correct, would settle the issue of Sony’s liability under
almost any definition of contributory infringement. The
Court concludes that time-shifting is fair use for two reasons.
Each is seriously flawed.

The Court’s first reason for concluding that time-shifting is
fair use is its claim that many copyright holders have no ob-
jection to time-shifting, and that “respondents have no right
to prevent other copyright holders from authorizing it for
their programs.” Ante, at 442. The Court explains that a
finding of contributory infringement would “inevitably frus--
trate the interests of broadcasters in reaching the portion of
their audience that 1s available only through time-shifting.”

ted by television to be registered by deposit of sample frames plus a de-
scription of the work. See 37 CFR §§ 202.20(c)(2)(ii) and 202.21(g) (1983).
Moreover, although an infringement action cannot be brought unless the
work is registered, 17 U. S. C. § 411(a) (1982 ed.), registration is not a con-
dition of copyright protection. § 408(a). Copying an unregistered work
still may be infringement. Cf. §506(a) (liability for criminal copyright
infringement; not conditioned on frior registration).

494 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
BLACKMUN, J., dissenting 464 U.S.

Ante, at 446. Such reasoning, however, simply confuses the
question of liability with the difficulty of fashioning an appro-
priate remedy. It may be that an injunction prohibiting the
sale of VTR’s would harm the interests of copyright holders
who have no objection to others making copies of their pro-
grams. But such concerns should and would be taken into
account in fashioning an appropriate remedy once liability has
been found. Remedies may well be available that would not
interfere with authorized time-shifting at all. The Court of
Appeals mentioned the possibility of a royalty payment that
would allow VTR sales and time-shifting to continue un-
abated, and the parties may be able to devise other narrowly
tailored remedies. Sony may be able, for example, to build
a VTR that enables broadcasters to scramble the signal of
individual programs and “jam” the unauthorized recording
of them. Even were an appropriate remedy not available
at this time, the Court should not misconstrue copyright
holders’ rights in a manner that prevents enforcement of
them when, through development of better techniques, an
appropriate remedy becomes available.“

“Even if concern with remedy were appropriate at the liability stage,
the Court’s use of the District Court’s findings is somewhat cavalier. The
Court relies heavily on testimony by representatives of professional sports
leagues to the effect that they have no objection to VTR recording. The
Court never states, however, whether the sports leagues are copyright
holders, and if so, whether they have exclusive copyrights to sports broad-
casts. It is therefore unclear whether the sports leagues have authority to
consent to copying the broadcasts of their events.

Assuming that the various sports leagues do have exclusive copyrights
in some of their broadcasts, the amount of authorized time-shifting still
would not be overwhelming. Sony’s own survey indicated that only 7.3%
of all Betamax use is to record sports events of all kinds. Tr. 2853, De-
fendants’ Exh. OT, Table 20. Because Sony’s witnesses did not represent
all forms of sports events, moreover, this figure provides only a tenuous
basis for this Court to engage in factfinding of its own.

The only witness at trial who was clearly an exclusive copyright owner
and who expressed no objection to unauthorized time-shifting was the
owner of the copyright in Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. But the Court

The Court’s second stated reason for finding that Sony is
not liable for contributory infringement is its conclusion that
even unauthorized time-shifting is fair use. Ante, at 447
et seg. This conclusion is even more troubling. The Court
begins by suggesting that the fair use doctrine operates as
a general “equitable rule of reason.” That interpretation
mischaracterizes the doctrine, and simply ignores the lan-
guage of the statute. Section 107 establishes the fair use
doctrine “for purposes such as criticism, comment, news re-
porting, teaching, . . . scholarship, or research.” These are
all productive uses. It is true that the legislative history
states repeatedly that the doctrine must be applied flexibly
on a case-by-case basis, but those references were only in the
context of productive uses. Such a limitation on fair use
comports with its purpose, which is to facilitate the creation
of new works. There is no indication that the fair use doc-
trine has any application for purely personal consumption.on
the scale involved in this case,“ and the Court’s application
of it here deprives fair use of the major cohesive force that
has guided evolution of the doctrine in the past.

cites no evidence in the record to the effect that anyone makes VTR copies
of that program. The simple fact is that the District Court made no find-
ings on the amount of authorized time-shifting that takes place. The
Court seems to recognize this gap in its reasoning, and phrases its argu-
ment as a hypothetical. The Court states: “Jf there are millions of owners
of VTR’s who make copies of televised sports events, religious broadcasts,
and educational programs such as Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, and if the
proprietors of those programs welcome the practice,” the sale of VTR’s
“should not be stifled” in order to protect respondents’ copyrights. Ante,
at 446 (emphasis supplied). Given that the Court seems to recognize that
its argument depends on findings that have not been made, it seems that a
remand is inescapable.

“As has been explained, some uses of time-shifting, such as copying
an old newspaper clipping for a friend, are fair use because of their de
minimis effect on the copyright holder. - The scale of copying involved in
this case, of course, is of an entirely different magnitude, precluding appli-
cation of such an exception.

496 OCTOBER TERM, 19838
BLACKMUN, J., dissenting 464 U.S.

Having bypassed the initial hurdle for establishing that a
use is fair, the Court then purports to apply to time-shifting
the four factors explicitly stated in the statute. The first is
“the purpose and character of the use, including whether
such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educa-
tional purposes.” §107(1). The Court confidently describes
time-shifting as a noncommercial, nonprofit activity. It is
clear, however, that personal use of programs that have been
copied without permission is not what § 107(1) protects. The
intent of the section is to encourage users to engage in activi-
ties the primary benefit of which accrues to others. Time-
shifting involves no such humanitarian impulse. It is like-
wise something of a mischaracterization of time-shifting to
describe it as noncommercial in the sense that that term
is used in the statute. As one commentator has observed,
time-shifting is noncommercial in the same sense that steal-
ing jewelry and wearing it—instead of reselling it—is non-
commercial.” Purely consumptive uses are certainly not
what the fair use doctrine was designed to protect, and the
awkwardness of applying the statutory language to time-
shifting only makes clearer that fair use was designed to pro-
tect only uses that are productive.

The next two statutory factors are all but ignored by the
Court—though certainly not because they have no applicabil-
ity. The second factor—“the nature of the copyrighted
work”—strongly supports the view that time-shifting is an
infringing use. The rationale guiding application of this fac-
tor is that certain types of works, typically those involving
“more of diligence than of originality or inventiveness,” New
York Times Co. v. Roxbury Data Interface, Inc., 434 F.
Supp. 217, 221 (NJ 1977), require less copyright protection
than other original works. Thus, for example, informational

committee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice of
the House Committee on the Judiciary, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 1250

SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 497
417 BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

works, such as news reports, that readily lend themselves to
productive use by others, are less protected than creative
works of entertainment. Sony’s own surveys indicate that
entertainment shows account for more than 80% of the pro-
grams recorded by Betamax owners.“ ;
The third statutory factor—“the amount and substanti-
ality of the portion used”—is even more devastating to the
Court’s interpretation. It is undisputed that virtually all
VTR owners record entire works, see 480 F. Supp., at 454,
thereby creating an exact substitute for the copyrighted orig-
inal. Fair use is intended to allow individuals engaged in
productive uses to copy small portions of original works that
will facilitate their own productive endeavors. Time-shifting
bears no resemblance to such activity, and the complete du-
plication that it involves might alone be sufficient to preclude
a finding of fair use. It is little wonder that the Court has
chosen to ignore this statutory factor.” ;
The fourth factor requires an evaluation of “the effect of
the use upon the potential market for or value of the copy-
righted work.” This is the factor upon which the Court
focuses, but once again, the Court has misread the statute.
As mentioned above, the statute requires a court to consider
the effect of the use on the potential market for the copy-
righted work. The Court has struggled mightily to show
that VTR use has not reduced the value of the Studios’ copy-
righted works in their present markets. Even if true, that
showing only begins the proper inquiry. The development

“See A Survey of Betamax Owners, Tr. 2353, Defendants’ Exh. OT,
Table 20, cited in Brief for Respondents 52.

“The Court’s one oblique acknowledgment of this third factor, ante, at
447, and n. 30, seems to suggest that the fact that time-shifting involves
copying complete works is not very significant because the viewers already
have been asked to watch the initial broadcast free. This suggestion
misses the point. As has been noted, a book borrowed from a public li-
brary may not be copied any more freely than one that has been purchased.
An invitation to view a showing is completely different from an invitation
to copy a copyrighted work.

498 OCTOBER TERM, 1983
BLACKMUN, J., dissenting 464 U.S.

of the VTR has created a new market for the works produced
by the Studios. That market consists of those persons who
desire to view television programs at times other than when
they are broadcast, and who therefore purchase VTR record-
ers to enable them to time-shift.” Because time-shifting of
the Studios’ copyrighted works involves the copying of them,
however, the Studios are entitled to share in the benefits
of that new market. Those benefits currently go to Sony
through Betamax sales. Respondents therefore can show
harm from VTR use simply by showing that the value of their
copyrights would increase if they were compensated for the
copies that are used in the new market. The existence of
this effect is self-evident.

Because of the Court’s conclusion concerning the legality of
time-shifting, it never addresses the amount of noninfringing
use that a manufacturer must show to absolve itself from
liability as a contributory infringer. Thus, it is difficult to
discuss how the Court’s test for contributory infringement
would operate in practice under a proper analysis of time-
shifting. One aspect of the test as it is formulated by the
Court, however, particularly deserves comment. The Court
explains that a manufacturer of a product is not liable for con-
tributory infringement as long as the product is “capable of
substantial noninfringing uses.” Ante, at 442 (emphasis sup-
plied). Such a definition essentially eviscerates the concept
of contributory infringement. Only the most unimaginative
manufacturer would be unable to demonstrate that a image-
duplicating product is “capable” of substantial noninfringing
uses. Surely Congress desired to prevent the sale of prod-
ucts that are used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights;

©The Court implicitly has recognized that this market is very significant.
The central concern underlying the Court’s entire opinion is that there is a
large audience who would like very much to be able to view programs at
times other than when they are broadcast. Ante, at 446. The Court sim-
ply misses the implication of its own concerns.


--- Page 84 ---
SONY CORP. v. UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC. 499
47 BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

the fact that noninfringing uses exist presumably would have
little bearing on that desire.

More importantly, the rationale for the Court’s narrow
standard of contributory infringement reveals that, once
again, the Court has confused the issue of liability with that
of remedy. The Court finds that a narrow definition of con-
tributory infringement is necessary in order to protect “the
rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated
areas of commerce.” Ante, at 442. But application of the
contributory infringement doctrine implicates such rights
only if the remedy attendant upon a finding of liability were
an injunction against the manufacture of the product in ques-
tion. The issue of an appropriate remedy is not before the
Court at this time, but it seems likely that a broad injunction
is not the remedy that would be ordered. It is unfortunate
that the Court has allowed its concern over a remedy to infect
its analysis of liability. :

VII

The Court of Appeals, having found Sony liable, remanded
for the District Court to consider the propriety of injunctive
or other relief. Because of my conclusion as to the issue of
liability, I, too, would not decide here what remedy would be
appropriate if liability were found. I concur, however, in
the Court of Appeals’ suggestion that an award of damages,
or continuing royalties, or even some form of limited injunc-
tion, may well be an appropriate means of balancing the equi-
ties in this case.*' Although I express no view on the merits

5 Other nations have imposed royalties on the manufacturers of products
used to infringe copyright. See, e. g., Copyright Laws and Treaties of the
World (UNESCO/BNA 1982) (English translation), reprinting Federal Act
on Copyright in Works of Literature and Art and on Related Rights (Aus-
tria), §§ 42(5)}(7), and An Act dealing with Copyright and Related Rights
(Federal Republic of Germany), Art. 53(5). A study produced for the
Commission of European Communities has recommended that these re-
quirements “serve as a pattern” for the European community. A. Dietz,
Copyright Law in the European Community 135 (1978). While these roy-

of any particular proposal, I am certain that, if Sony were
found liable in this case, the District Court would be able to
fashion appropriate relief. The District Court might con-
clude, of course, that a continuing royalty or other equitable
relief is not feasible. The Studios then would be relegated
to statutory damages for proven instances of infringement.
But the difficulty of fashioning relief, and the possibility that
complete relief may be unavailable, should not affect our
interpretation of the statute.

Like so many other problems created by the interaction of
copyright law with a new technology, “[t]here can be no
really satisfactory solution to the problem presented here,
until Congress acts.” Twentieth Century Music Corp. v.
Aiken, 422 U. S., at 167 (dissenting opinion). But in the ab-
sence of a congressional solution, courts cannot avoid difficult
problems by refusing to apply the law. We must “take the
Copyright Act... as we find it,” Fortnightly Corp. v. United
Artists Television, Inc., 392 U. S., at 401-402, and “do as
little damage as possible to traditional copyright principles

. . until the Congress legislates.” Id., at 404 (dissenting
opinion).

alty systems ordinarily depend on the existence of authors’ collecting soci-
eties, see id., at 119, 136, such collecting societies are a familiar part of our
copyright law. See generally Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broad-
casting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1979). Fashioning relief of this
sort, of course, might require bringing other copyright owners into court
through certification of a class or otherwise.

OPINION
CANBY, Circuit Judge:

In this case we are called upon once again to apply the principles of copyright law to computers and their software, to
determine what must be protected as expression and what must be made accessible to the public as function. Sony
Computer Entertainment, Inc., which brought this copyright infringement action, produces and markets the Sony PlayStation
console, a small computer with hand controls that connects to a television console and plays games that are inserted into
the PlayStation on compact discs (CDs). Sony owns the copyright on the basic input-output system or BIOS, which is the
software program that operates its PlayStation. Sony has asserted no patent rights in this proceeding.

The defendant is the Connectix Corporation, which makes and sells a software program called ""Virtual Game Station.""
The purpose of the Virtual Game Station is to emulate on a regular computer the functioning of the Sony PlayStation
console, so that computer owners who buy the Virtual Game Station software can play Sony PlayStation games on their
computers. The Virtual Game Station does not contain any of Sony's copyrighted material. In the process of producing the
Virtual Game Station, however, Connectix repeatedly copied Sony's copyrighted BIOS during a process of ""reverse
engineering"" that Connectix conducted in order to find out how the Sony PlayStation worked. Sony claimed infringement and
sought a preliminary injunction. The district court concluded

Page 599

that Sony was likely to succeed on its infringement claim because Connectix's ""intermediate copying "" was not a protected
""fair use"" under 17 U.S.C. S 107. The district court enjoined Connectix from selling the Virtual Game Station or from copying
or using the Sony BIOS code in the development of other Virtual Game Station products.

Connectix now appeals. We reverse and remand with instructions to dissolve the injunction. The intermediate copies
made and used by Connectix during the course of its reverse engineering of the Sony BIOS were protected fair use,
necessary to permit Connectix to make its non-infringing Virtual Game Station function with PlayStation games. Any other
intermediate copies made by Connectix do not support injunctive relief, even if those copies were infringing.

The district court also found that Sony is likely to prevail on its claim that Connectix's sale of the Virtual Game Station
program tarnishes the Sony PlayStation mark under 15 U.S.C. S 1125. We reverse that ruling as well.

|. Background


--- Page 2 ---
A. The products

Sony is the developer, manufacturer and distributor of both the Sony PlayStation and Sony PlayStation games. Sony
also licenses other companies to make games that can play on the PlayStation. The PlayStation system consists of a
console (essentially a mini-computer), controllers, and software that produce a three-dimensional game for play on a
television set. The PlayStation games are CDs that load into the top of the console. The PlayStation console contains both
(1) hardware components and (2) software known as firmware that is written onto a read-only memory (ROM) chip. The
firmware is the Sony BIOS. Sony has a copyright on the BIOS. It has claimed no patent relevant to this proceeding on any
component of the PlayStation. PlayStation is a registered trademark of Sony.

Connectix's Virtual Game Station is software that ""emulates"" the functioning of the PlayStation console. That is, a
consumer can load the Virtual Game Station software onto a computer, load a PlayStation game into the computer's
CDROM drive, and play the PlayStation game. The Virtual Game Station software thus emulates both the hardware and
firmware components of the Sony console. The Virtual Game Station does not play PlayStation games as well as Sony's
PlayStation does. At the time of the injunction, Connectix had marketed its Virtual Game Station for Macintosh computer
systems but had not yet completed Virtual Game Station software for Windows.

B. Reverse engineering

Copyrighted software ordinarily contains both copyrighted and unprotected or functional elements. Sega Enters. Ltd. v.
Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 , 1520 (9th Cir. 1993) (amended opinion); see 17 U.S.C. S 102(b) (Copyright protection does
not extend to any ""idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery"" embodied in the
copyrighted work.). Software engineers designing a product that must be compatible with a copyrighted product frequently
must ""reverse engineer"" the copyrighted product to gain access to the functional elements of the copyrighted product. See
Andrew Johnson-Laird, Software Reverse Engineering in the Real World, 19 U. Dayton L. Rev. 843, 845-46 (1994).

Reverse engineering encompasses several methods of gaining access to the functional elements of a software
program. They include: (1) reading about the program; (2) observing ""the program in operation by using it on a computer;""
(3) performing a ""static examination of the individual computer instructions contained within the program; "" and (4)
performing a ""dynamic examination of the individual computer instructions as the program is being run on a computer."" Id. at
846.

Page 600

Method (1) is the least effective, because individual software manuals often misdescribe the real product. See id. It would be
particularly ineffective in this case because Sony does not make such information available about its PlayStation. Methods
(2), (3), and (4) require that the person seeking access load the target program on to a computer, an operation that
necessarily involves copying the copyrighted program into the computer's random access memory or RAM. +

Method (2), observation of a program, can take several forms. The functional elements of some software programs, for
example word processing programs, spreadsheets, and video game displays may be discernible by observation of the
computer screen. See Sega, 977 F.2d at 1520 . Of course, the reverse engineer in such a situation is not observing the
object code itself, 2 only the external visual expression of this code's operation on the computer. Here, the software program
is copied each time the engineer boots up the computer, and the computer copies the program into RAM.

Other forms of observation are more intrusive. Operations systems, system interface procedures, and other programs
like the Sony BIOS are not visible to the user when they are operating. See id. One method of ""observing"" the operation of
these programs is to run the program in an emulated environment. In the case of the Sony BIOS, this meant operating the
BIOS on a computer with software that simulated the operation of the PlayStation hardware; operation of the program, in
conjunction with another program known as a ""debugger,"" permitted the engineers to observe the signals sent between the
BIOS and other programs on the computer. This latter method required copying the Sony BIOS from a chip in the
PlayStation onto the computer. The Sony BIOS was copied again each time the engineers booted up their computer and
the computer copied the program into RAM. All of this copying was intermediate; that is, none of the Sony copyrighted
material was copied into, or appeared in, Connectix's final product, the Virtual Game Station.

Methods (3) and (4) constitute ""disassembly"" of object code into source code. 2In each case, engineers use a program
known as a ""dissassembler"" to translate the ones and zeros of binary machine-readable object code into the words and
mathematical symbols of source code. This translated source code is similar to the source code used originally to create the
object code 4 but lacks the annotations drafted by the authors of the program that help explain the functioning of the source
code. In a static examination of the computer instructions, method (3), the engineer disassembles the object code of all or
part of the program. The program must generally be copied one or more times to perform disassembly. In a dynamic
examination of the computer instructions, method (4), the engineer uses the disassembler program to disassemble parts of
the program, one instruction at a time, while the program is running. This method also requires copying

Page 601

the program and, depending on the number of times this operation is performed, may require additional copying of the
program into RAM every time the computer is booted up.

C. Connectix's reverse engineering of the Sony BIOS


--- Page 3 ---
Connectix began developing the Virtual Game Station for Macintosh on about July 1, 1998. In order to develop a
PlayStation emulator, Connectix needed to emulate both the PlayStation hardware and the firmware (the Sony BIOS).

Connectix first decided to emulate the PlayStation's hardware. In order to do so, Connectix engineers purchased a
Sony PlayStation console and extracted the Sony BIOS from a chip inside the console. Connectix engineers then copied the
Sony BIOS into the RAM of their computers and observed the functioning of the Sony BIOS in conjunction with the Virtual
Game Station hardware emulation software as that hardware emulation software was being developed by Connectix. The
engineers observed the operation of the Sony BIOS through use of a debugging program that permitted the engineers to
observe the signals sent between the BIOS and the hardware emulation software. During this process, Connectix engineers
made additional copies of the Sony BIOS every time they booted up their computer and the Sony BIOS was loaded into
RAM.

Once they had developed the hardware emulation software, Connectix engineers also used the Sony BIOS to ""debug""
he emulation software. In doing so, they repeatedly copied and disassembled discrete portions of the Sony BIOS.

Connectix also used the Sony BIOS to begin development of the Virtual Game Station for Windows. Specifically, they
made daily copies to RAM of the Sony BIOS and used the Sony BIOS to develop certain Windows-specific systems for the
Virtual Game Station for Windows. Although Connectix had its own BIOS at the time, Connectix engineers used the Sony
BIOS because it contained CD-ROM code that the Connectix BIOS did not contain.

Early in the development process, Connectix engineer Aaron Giles disassembled a copy of the entire Sony BIOS that
he had downloaded from the Internet. He did so for the purpose of testing a ""disassembler"" program he had written. The
print-out of the source code was not used to develop the Virtual Game Station emulator. Connectix engineers initially used
his copy of the Sony BIOS to begin the reverse engineering process, but abandoned it after realizing that it was a
Japanese-language version.

During development of the Virtual Game Station, Connectix contacted Sony and requested ""technical assistance"" from
Sony to complete the development of the Virtual Game Station. Connectix and Sony representatives met during September
1998. Sony declined Connectix's request for assistance.

Connectix completed Virtual Game Station for Macintosh computers in late December 1998 or early January 1999.
Connectix announced its new product at the MacWorld Expo on January 5, 1999. At MacWorld, Connectix marketed the
Virtual Game Station as a ""PlayStation emulator."" The materials stated that the Virtual Game Station permits users to play
""their favorite Playstation games"" on a computer ""even if you don't yet have a Sony PlayStation console.""

D. Procedural history

On January 27, 1999, Sony filed a complaint alleging copyright infringement and other causes of action against
Connectix. Sony subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction on the grounds of copyright and trademark infringement.
The district court granted the motion, enjoining Connectix: (1) from copying or using the Sony BIOS code in the
development of the Virtual Game Station for Windows; and (2) from selling the Virtual Game Station for Macintosh or the
Virtual Game

Page 602

Station for Windows. Order on Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 27. The district court also impounded all Connectix's copies of the
Sony BIOS and all copies of works based upon or incorporating Sony BIOS. Id. at 27-28. Connectix now appeals from this
order.

Il. Discussion

To prevail on its motion for injunctive relief, Sony was required to demonstrate ""either a likelihood of success on the
merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of
the hardships tip sharply in its favor."" Cadence Design Sys., Inc. v. Avant! Corp., 125 F.3d 824 , 826 (9th Cir. 1997) (internal
quotation marks and bracket omitted), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1118 (1998) . We reverse the grant of a preliminary injunction
only when ""the district court abused its discretion or based its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly
erroneous findings of fact."" Roe v. Anderson, 134 F.3d 1400 , 1402 n.1 (9th Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted),
aff'd on other grounds, sub nom. Saenz v. Roe. 526 U.S. 489 (1999) . We review the scope of injunctive relief for an abuse
of discretion. SEC v. Interlink Data Network of L.A., Inc., 77 F.3d 1201 , 1204 (9th Cir. 1996).

Connectix admits that it copied Sony's copyrighted BIOS software in developing the Virtual Game Station but contends
that doing so was protected as a fair use under 17 U.S.C. S 107. Connectix also challenges the district court's conclusion
that Sony has established a likelihood that Connectix's Virtual Game Station tarnishes the PlayStation trademark. We
consider each of these claims below.

A. Fair use

The fair use issue arises in the present context because of certain characteristics of computer software. The object
code of a program may be copyrighted as expression, 17 U.S.C. S 102(a), but it also contains ideas and performs functions
that are not entitled to copyright protection. See 17 U.S.C. S 102(b). Object code cannot, however, be read by humans. The
unprotected ideas and functions of the code therefore are frequently undiscoverable in the absence of investigation and


--- Page 4 ---
translation that may require copying the copyrighted material. We conclude that, under the facts of this case and our
precedent, Connectix's intermediate copying and use of Sony's copyrighted BIOS was a fair use for the purpose of gaining
access to the unprotected elements of Sony's software.

The general framework for analysis of fair use is established by statute, 17 U.S.C. S 107. 3We have applied this statute
and the fair use doctrine to the disassembly of computer software in the case of Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977
F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1993) (amended opinion). Central to our decision today is the rule set forth in Sega:

[W]here disassembly is the only way to gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted
computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassem bly is a fair use of the
copyrighted work, as a matter of law.

Id. at 1527-28 (emphasis added). In Sega , we recognized that intermediate copying could constitute copyright
Page 603

infringement even when the end product did not itself contain copyrighted material. Id. at 1518-19. But this copying
nonetheless could be protected as a fair use if it was ""necessary "" to gain access to the functional elements of the software
itself. Id. at 1524-26. We drew this distinction because the Copyright Act protects expression only, not ideas or the functional
aspects of a software program. See id. at 1524 (citing 17 U.S.C. S 102(b)). We also recognized that, in the case of computer
programs, this idea/expression distinction poses ""unique problems"" because computer programs are ""in essence, utilitarian
articles -articles that accomplish tasks. As such, they contain many logical, structural, and visual display elements that are
dictated by the function to be performed, by considerations of efficiency, or by external factors such as compatibility
requirements and industry demands."" Id. Thus, the fair use doctrine preserves public access to the ideas and functional
elements embedded in copyrighted computer software programs. This approach is consistent with the "" “ultimate aim [of the
Copyright Act], to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.' "" Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc.
464 U.S. 417 , 432 (1984) (quoting Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151 , 156 (1975)).

We turn then to the statutory fair use factors, as informed by our precedent in Sega.
1. Nature of the copyrighted work

Under our analysis of the second statutory factor, nature of the copyrighted work, we recognize that ""some works are
closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others."" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569 , 586
(1994). Sony's BIOS lies at a distance from the core because it contains unprotected aspects that cannot be examined
without copying. See Sega, 977 F.2d at 1526 . We consequently accord it a ""lower degree of protection than more traditional
literary works."" Id. As we have applied this standard, Connectix's copying of the Sony BIOS must have been ""necessary"" to
have been fair use. See id. at 1524-26. We conclude that it was.

There is no question that the Sony BIOS contains unprotected functional elements. Nor is it disputed that Connectix
could not gain access to these unprotected functional elements without copying the Sony BIOS. Sony admits that little
technical information about the functionality of the Sony BIOS is publicly available. The Sony BIOS is an internal operating
system that does not produce a screen display to reflect its functioning. Consequently, if Connectix was to gain access to
the functional elements of the Sony BIOS it had to be through a form of reverse engineering that required copying the Sony
BIOS onto a computer. & Sony does not dispute this proposition.

The question then becomes whether the methods by which Connectix reverse-engineered the Sony BIOS were
necessary to gain access to the unprotected functional elements within the program. We conclude that they were. Connectix
employed several methods of reverse engineering (observation and observation with partial disassembly) each of which
required Connectix to make intermediate copies of copyrighted material. Neither of these methods renders fair use
protection inapplicable. Sega expressly sanctioned

Page 604

disassembly. See id. at 1527-28. We see no reason to distinguish observation of copyrighted software in an emulated
computer environment. Both methods require the reverse engineer to copy protected as well as unprotected elements of the
computer program. Because this intermediate copying is the gravamen of the intermediate infringement claim, see 17

U.S.C. S 106(1); Sega, 977 F.2d at 1518-19 , and both methods of reverse engineering require it, we find no reason inherent
in these methods to prefer one to another as a matter of copyright law. Connectix presented evidence that it observed the
Sony BIOS in an emulated environment to observe the functional aspects of the Sony BIOS. When this method of reverse
engineering was unsuccessful, Connectix engineers disassembled discrete portions of the Sony BIOS to view directly the
ideas contained therein. We conclude that intermediate copying in this manner was ""necessary"" within the meaning of Sega.

We decline to follow the approach taken by the district court. The district court did not focus on whether Connectix's
copying of the Sony BIOS was necessary for access to functional elements. Instead, it found that Connectix's copying and
use of the Sony BIOS to develop its own software exceeded the scope of Sega. See Order at 17 (""[T]hey disassembled
Sony's code not just to study the concepts. They actually used that code in the development of [their] product.""). This
rationale is unpersuasive. It is true that Sega referred to ""studying or examining the unprotected aspects of a copyrighted
computer program."" 977 F.2d at 1520 (emphasis added). But in Sega, Accolade's copying, observation and disassembly of
Sega's game cartridges was held to be fair use, even though Accolade ""loaded the disassembled code back into a


--- Page 5 ---
computer, and experimented to discover the interface specifications for the Genesis console by modifying the programs and
studying the results."" Id. at 1515. Thus, the distinction between ""studying"" and ""use"" is unsupported in Sega. Moreover,
reverse engineering is a technically complex, frequently iterative process. Johnson-Laird, 19 U. Dayton L. Rev. at 843-44.
Within the limited context of a claim of intermediate infringement, we find the semantic distinction between ""studying"" and
""use"" to be artificial, and decline to adopt it for purposes of determining fair use. Z

We also reject the argument, urged by Sony, that Connectix infringed the Sony copyright by repeatedly observing the
Sony BIOS in an emulated environment, thereby making repeated copies of the Sony BIOS. These intermediate copies
could not have been ""necessary"" under Sega , contends Sony, because Connectix engineers could have disassembled the
entire Sony BIOS first, then written their own Connectix BIOS, and used the Connectix BIOS to develop the Virtual Game
Station hardware emulation software. We accept Sony's factual predicate for the limited purpose of this appeal. 8 Our doing
so, however, does not aid Sony.

Page 605

Sony contends that Connectix's reverse engineering of the Sony BIOS should be considered unnecessary on the
rationale that Connectix's decision to observe the Sony BIOS in an emulated environment required Connectix to make more
intermediate copies of the Sony BIOS than if Connectix had performed a complete disassembly of the program. Under this
logic, at least some of the intermediate copies were not necessary within the meaning of Sega. This construction stretches
Sega too far. The ""necessity"" we addressed in Sega was the necessity of the method, i.e., disassembly, not the necessity of
the number of times that method was applied. See 977 F.2d at 1524-26 . In any event, the interpretation advanced by Sony
would be a poor criterion for fair use. Most of the intermediate copies of the Sony BIOS were made by Connectix engineers
when they booted up their computers and the Sony BIOS was copied into RAM. But if Connectix engineers had left their
computers turned on throughout the period during which they were observing the Sony BIOS in an emulated environment,
they would have made far fewer intermediate copies of the Sony BIOS (perhaps as few as one per computer). Even if we
were inclined to supervise the engineering solutions of software companies in minute detail, and we are not, our application
of the copyright law would not turn on such a distinction. 2Such a rule could be easily manipulated. More important, the rule
urged by Sony would require that a software engineer, faced with two engineering solutions that each require intermediate
copying of protected and unprotected material, often follow the least efficient solution. (In cases in which the solution that
required the fewest number of intermediate copies was also the most efficient, an engineer would pursue it, presumably,
without our urging.) This is precisely the kind of ""wasted effort that the proscription against the copyright of ideas and facts .
. . [is] designed to prevent."" Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340 , 354 (1991) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Such an approach would erect an artificial hurdle in the way of the public's access to the ideas contained
within copyrighted software programs. These are ""aspects that were expressly denied copyright protection by Congress.""
Sega, 977 F.2d at 1526 (citing 17 U.S.C. S 102(b)). We decline to erect such a barrier in this case. If Sony wishes to obtain
a lawful monopoly on the functional concepts in its software, it must satisfy the more stringent standards of the patent laws.
See Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats. Inc., 489 U.S. 141 , 160-61 (1989); Sega, 977 F.2d at 1526 . This Sony has
not done. The second statutory factor strongly favors Connectix.

2. Amount and substantiality of the portion used
With respect to the third statutory factor, amount and substantiality of the portion
Page 606

used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, Connectix disassembled parts of the Sony BIOS and copied the entire
Sony BIOS multiple times. This factor therefore weighs against Connectix. But as we concluded in Sega, in a case of
intermediate infringement when the final product does not itself contain infringing material, this factor is of ""very little weight.""
Sega, 977 F.2d at 152627 ; see also Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios. Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 449-50 (1984)
(copying of entire work does not preclude fair use).

3. Purpose and character of the use

Under the first factor, purpose and character of the use, we inquire into whether Connectix's Virtual Game Station
merely supersedes the objects of the original cre ation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different
character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message; it asks, in other words, whether and to what extent
the new work is ""transformative.""

Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As an
initial matter, we conclude that the district court applied an erroneous legal standard; the district court held that Connectix's
commercial purpose in copying the Sony BIOS gave rise to a ""presumption of unfairness that . . . can be rebutted by the
characteristics of a particular commercial use."" Order at 14-15 (citing Sega, 977 F.2d at 1522 ). Since Sega, however, the
Supreme Court has rejected this presumption as applied to the first and fourth factor of the fair use analysis. Acuff-Rose,
510 U.S. at 584 , 594 (clarifying Sony, 464 U.S. at 451 ). Instead, the fact that Connectix's copying of the Sony BIOS was
for a commercial purpose is only a ""separate factor that tends to weigh against a finding of fair use."" Id. at 585 (internal
quotation marks omitted). 12

We find that Connectix's Virtual Game Station is modestly transformative. The product creates a new platform, the
personal computer, on which consumers can play games designed for the Sony PlayStation. This innovation affords
opportunities for game play in new environments, specifically anywhere a Sony PlayStation console and television are not


--- Page 6 ---
available, but a computer with a CD-ROM drive is. More important, the Virtual Game Station itself is a wholly new product,
notwithstanding the similarity of uses and functions between the Sony PlayStation and the Virtual Game Station. The
expressive element of software lies as much in the organization and structure of the object code that runs the computer as it
does in the visual expression of that code that appears on a computer screen. See 17 U.S.C.S 102(a) (extending copyright
protection to original works of authorship that ""can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or
with the aid of a machine or device""). Sony does not claim that the Virtual Game Station itself contains object code that
infringes Sony's copyright. We are therefore at a loss to see how Connectix's drafting of entirely new object code for its VGS

Page 607
program could not be transformative, despite the similarities in function and screen output.

Finally, we must weigh the extent of any transformation in Connectix's Virtual Game Station against the significance of
other factors, including commercialism, that militate against fair use. See Acuff-Rose, 510 U.S. at 579 . Connectix's
commercial use of the copyrighted material was an intermediate one, and thus was only ""indirect or derivative."" Sega, 977
F.2d at 1522 . Moreover, Connectix reverse-engineered the Sony BIOS to produce a product that would be compatible with
games designed for the Sony PlayStation. We have recognized this purpose as a legitimate one under the first factor of the
air use analysis. See id. Upon weighing these factors, we find that the first factor favors Connectix.

The district court ruled, however, that the Virtual Game Station was not transformative on the rationale that a computer
screen and a television screen are interchangeable, and the Connectix product therefore merely ""supplants "" the Sony
PlayStation console. Order at 15. The district court clearly erred. For the reasons stated above, the Virtual Game Station is
ransformative and does not merely supplant the PlayStation console. In reaching its decision, the district court apparently
ailed to consider the expressive nature of the Virtual Game Station software itself. Sony's reliance on Infinity Broadcast
Corp. v. Kirkwood, 150 F.3d 104 (2d Cir. 1998) , suffers from the same defect. The Infinity court reasoned that a ""change of
ormat, though useful, is not technically a transformation."" Id. at 108 n.2. But the infringing party in that case was merely
‘aking copyrighted radio transmissions and retransmitting them over telephone lines; there was no new expression. Id. at
108. Infinity does not change our conclusion; the purpose and character of Connectix's copying points toward fair use.

4. Effect of the use upon the potential market

We also find that the fourth factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, favors Connectix. Under this factor, we
consider

not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also ""whether
unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant . . . would result in a substantially adverse
impact on the potential market"" for the original.

Acuff-Rose, 510 U.S. at 590 (quoting 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright, S 13.05[A][4], at 13-102.61
(1993)). Whereas a work that merely supplants or supersedes another is likely to cause a substantially adverse impact on
the potential market of the original, a transformative work is less likely to do so. See id. at 591; Harper & Row, Publishers.
Inc. v. Nation Enters, Inc., 471 U.S. 539 , 567-69 (1985).

The district court found that""[t]o the extent that such a substitution [of Connectix's Virtual Game Station for Sony
PlayStation console] occurs, Sony will lose console sales and profits."" Order at 19. We recognize that this may be so. But
because the Virtual Game Station is transformative, and does not merely supplant the PlayStation console, the Virtual Game
Station is a legitimate competitor in the market for platforms on which Sony and Sony-licensed games can be played. See
Sega, 977 F.2d at 1522-23 . For this reason, some economic loss by Sony as a result of this competition does not compel a
finding of no fair use. Sony understandably seeks control over the market for devices that play games Sony produces or
licenses. The copyright law, however, does not confer such a monopoly. See id. at 1523-24 (""[A]n attempt to monopolize the
market by making it impossible for others to compete runs counter to the statutory purpose of promoting creative

Page 608

expression and cannot constitute a strong equitable basis for resisting the invocation of the fair use doctrine.""). This factor
favors Connectix.

The four statutory fair use factors must be ""weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright. "" Acuff-Rose, 510
U.S. at 578 . Here, three of the factors favor Connectix; one favors Sony, and it is of little weight. Of course, the statutory
factors are not exclusive, Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 560 , but we are unaware of other factors not already considered that
would affect our analysis. Accordingly, we conclude that Connectix's intermediate copying of the Sony BIOS during the
course of its reverse engineering of that product was a fair use under 17 U.S.C. S 107, as a matter of law. With respect to its
claim of copyright infringement, Sony has not established either a likelihood of success on the merits or that the balance of
hardships tips in its favor. See Cadence Design Sys., Inc. v. Avant! Corp., 125 F.3d 824 , 826 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied,
523 U.S. 1118 (1998) . Accordingly, we need not address defenses asserted by Connectix under 17 U.S.C. S 117(a)(1) and
our doctrine of copyright misuse. We reverse the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction on the ground of copyright
infringement. 1+

B. Tarnishment

The district court found that Connectix's sale of the Virtual Game Station tarnished Sony's ""PlayStation"" mark under 15


--- Page 7 ---
U.S.C. S 1125(c)(1). The district court based its preliminary injunction, however, exclusively on Sony's copyright claim, and
did not cite its tarnishment finding as a ground for the injunction. Although we can ""affirm the district court on any ground
supported by the record, "" Charley's Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Haw.., Inc., 810 F.2d 869 , 874 (9th Cir. 1987), we
decline to affirm on this alternative ground. Sony has not shown a likelihood of success on each element of the tarnishment
claim.

To prevail on its tarnishment claim, Sony must show that (1) the PlayStation ""mark is famous;"" (2) Connectix is ""making
a commercial use of the mark;"" (3) Connectix's ""use began after the mark became famous;"" and (4) Connectix's ""use of the
mark dilutes the quality of the mark by diminishing the capacity of the mark to identify and distinguish goods and services.""
Films of Distinction, Inc. v. Allegro Film Prods.., Inc., 12 F. Supp. 2d 1068 , 1078 (C.D. Cal. 1998); 15 U.S.C. SS 1125(c)(1),
1127 (definition of ""dilution""). Connectix does not dispute the first and third of these elements. We address only the fourth

element.

Because Sony proceeds under a tarnishment theory of dilution, it must show under this fourth element that its
PlayStation mark will ""suffer negative associations"" through Connectix's use. Hormel Foods Corp. v. Jim Henson Prods.
Inc., 73 F.3d 497 ,

Page 609

507 (2d Cir. 1996); see also 4 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair CompetitionS 24.95 (4th ed. 1996
& Supp. 1999). The district court found the Virtual Game Station does not play PlayStation games as well as the PlayStation
console, and that although the Virtual Game Station's packaging contains a disclaimer to this effect, ""game players do not
comprehend this distinction."" Order at 24-25. The Sony PlayStation mark therefore suffers negative associations because of
this confusion on the part of consumers who play Sony games on the Virtual Game Station software. Id. at 25.

The evidence on the record does not support such a finding of misattribution. The district court relied primarily on a
series of semi-anonymous reviews posted on the Internet and submitted by Connectix. As the district court acknowledged,
these reviews were neither authenticated nor identified. More important, the print-out of the comments does not reveal the
context in which the comments were made; this omission makes the extent of any confusion by game players difficult to
assess reliably. The district court also referred to two focus group studies conducted by market research firms at Sony's
bequest. These studies address the difference of quality between the Virtual Game Station and PlayStation, but shed no
light on the question of misattribution. Thus, we reject as clearly erroneous the district court's finding that the Virtual Game
Station tarnishes the Sony PlayStation mark on a misattribution theory of tarnishment.

Nor are we persuaded by Sony's argument that the difference in quality between the two platforms is itself sufficient to
find tarnishment. See Deere & Co. v. MTD Prods, Inc., 41 F.3d 39 , 43 (2d Cir. 1994) (""*Tarnishment' generally arises when
the plaintiff's trademark is linked to products of shoddy quality,"" diminishing the value of the mark ""because the public will
associate the lack of quality . . . with the plaintiff's unrelated goods.""). Even if we assume, without deciding, that the concept
of tarnishment is applicable to the present factual scenario, there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of tarnishment.
""The sine qua non of tarnishment is a finding that plaintiff's mark will suffer negative associations through defendant's use.""
Hormel Foods, 73 F.3d at 507 . The evidence here fails to show or suggest that Sony's mark or product was regarded or
was likely to be regarded negatively because of its performance on Connectix's Virtual Game Station. The evidence is not
even substantial on the quality of that performance. The Sony studies, each of included eight participants, presented a
range of conclusions. One study concluded that ""[o]n balance, the results of this focus group study show that the testers
preferred the PlayStation gaming experience over the Virtual Game Station gaming experience."" The other concluded that
consumers found the Virtual Game Station was ""generally acceptable "" for one game, but ""nearly unplayable"" on another.
The internet reviews submitted by Connectix also presented a range of opinion; while some anonymous reviewers loved the
Virtual Game Station, some were ambivalent, and a relative few hated the Virtual Game Station emulation. In the only
review for attribution, Newsweek said the software played ""surprisingly well,"" and that some games on the Virtual Game
Station ""rocked."" Steven Levy, ""Play it Your Way,"" Newsweek, Mar. 15, 1999, at 84. This evidence is insufficient to support a
conclusion that the shoddiness of the Virtual Game Station alone tarnishes the Sony mark. Sony's tarnishment claim cannot
support the injunction.

CONCLUSION

Connectix's reverse engineering of the Sony BIOS extracted from a Sony PlayStation console purchased by Connectix
engineers is protected as a fair use. Other intermediate copies of the Sony BIOS made by Connectix, if they infringed Sony's
copyright, do not justify injunctive relief. For these reasons, the district

Page 610

court's injunction is dissolved and the case is remanded to the district court. We also reverse the district court's finding that
Connectix's Virtual Game Station has tarnished the Sony PlayStation mark.

REVERSED AND REMANDED.

Notes:

1. Any purchaser of a copyrighted software program must copy the program into the memory of a computer in order to make any use at all of the


--- Page 8 ---
program. For that reason, 17 U.S.C. S 117(a)(1) provides that it shall not be an infringement for one who owns a software copy to make another copy
""created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner."" Connectix
contends that its copying is within the protection of section 117, but our disposition of the fair use issue makes it unnecessary for us to address that
contention. See Sega, 977 F.2d at 1517-18 (rejecting contention that disassembly is protected by section 117).

6. Connectix offers evidence that it attempted to gain access to the functionality of the Sony BIOS by attaching a ""logic analyzer"" to the input and output
leads of the chip on which the Sony BIOS was located within the PlayStation console. This form of observation does not appear to require the making of
an intermediate copy, but was of limited value because it permitted the observation of inter-chip, but not intra-chip signals. Sony does not suggest that
this form of observation alone would have permitted Connectix engineers to gain access to the functional elements of the Sony BIOS.

7. We are unable to locate evidence in the record to support the district court's finding that Connectix ""gradually convert[ed] Sony's code to their own
code,"" Order at 11, if by this statement the court meant that Connectix engineers failed to create an original work. True, Connectix engineers admitted to
combining the Sony BIOS with the Virtual Game Station hardware emulation software to test and develop the hardware emulation software. But in
drafting the Connectix BIOS, Connectix engineers never claimed to do anything other than write their own code, even though they used, observed, copied
and sometimes disassembled the Sony BIOS as they did so. Sony presents no evidence to the contrary, nor does Sony contend that Connectix's final
product contains infringing material.

8. The depositions of Connectix engineers Aaron Giles and Eric Traut suggest that Connectix engineers recognized that other engineering solutions were
sometimes available.

With respect to the observation of the Sony BIOS in an emulated environment, Traut admitted that it was easier to use the Sony BIOS to develop the
hardware emulation software than to develop Connectix own BIOS first, and then use the Connectix BIOS to develop the hardware emulation software.

With respect to the observation of the Sony BIOS with selective disassembly of the code, Traut stated with respect to one bug that there would have been
no way to fix the bug without disassembling a portion of the Sony BIOS. He also stated that at other times he disassembled portions of the Sony BIOS
when doing so was ""the most efficient way of finding that bug."" In a subsequent question, he clarified that disassembly was not the only way to fix the
bug, just the fastest way to do so.

With respect to Connectix's observation of the Sony BIOS in the development of the Virtual Game Station for Windows, other solutions, presumably
disassembly, may have been possible. Connectix engineer Giles responded ""I don't know"" when asked by Sony counsel if ""it would have been possible to
write the CD-ROM code before building the emulator.""

9. Sony relies on these RAM copies for its contention, which we reject, that there is no significant difference between the facts of this case and our
decisions in Triad Systems Corp. v. Southeastern Express Co., 64 F.3d 1330 (9th Cir. 1995) and MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.. 991 F.2d
511 (9th Cir. 1993) . Those cases are inapposite to our fair use analysis. Neither involved reverse engineering of software to gain access to unprotected
functional elements.

10. Sony points to Micro Star v. Formgen, Inc., 154 F.3d 1107 (9th Cir. 1998) , for the proposition that commercial use creates a presumption of
unfairness. See id. at 1113 (quoting Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios. Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 451 (1984)). We do not read Micro Star that way;
moreover, such a reading would be contrary to Acuff-Rose. AcuffRose expressly rejected such a ""hard evidentiary presumption"" and stated that the Court
of Appeals ""erred"" by giving such dispositive weight to the commercial nature of the use. 510 U.S. at 584 . Also, Micro Star itself involved a use that was
non-transformative, which is not the case here. See Micro Star, 154 F.3d at 1113 & n.6. Cf. American Geophysical Union v. Texaco, Inc., 60 F.3d 913,
921-22 (2d Cir. 1995) (amended opinion) (rejecting, on grounds of Acuff-Rose and collected cases, presumption of unfairness for commercial use as
applied to Texaco's intermediate copying of copyrighted articles).

11. We do not accept Sony's argument that the downloading of Sony's BIOS from the Internet was itself an infringement justifying the injunction. The
evidence of record suggests that the downloaded BIOS played a minimal role, if any, in development of the Virtual Game Station. We conclude that, on
this record, the downloading infringement, if such it was, would not justify our upholding the injunction on the development and sale of the Virtual Game
Station. The Virtual Game Station itself infringes no copyright. Bearing in mind the goals of the copyright law, ""to stimulate artistic creativity for the
general public good,"" Sony, 464 U.S. at 432 (internal quotation marks omitted), we conclude that there is a legitimate public interest in the publication of
Connectix's software, and that this interest is not overborne by the record evidence related to the downloaded BIOS. The imposition of an injunction is
discretionary. See 17 U.S.C. S 502(a). On this record, we conclude that it would be inappropriate to uphold the injunction because of Connectix's copying
and use of the downloaded Sony BIOS; damages would adequately protect Sony's interest with respect to that alleged infringement. See Acuff-Rose,
510 U.S. at 578 n.10 (discussing factors to be evaluated in deciding whether to enjoin product found to have exceeded bounds of fair use).

OPINION AND ORDER
JESSE M. FURMAN, United States District Judge:

Defendant My Other Bag, Inc. (“MOB”) sells simple canvas tote bags with the text “My Other Bag ...” on one side and
drawings meant to evoke iconic handbags by luxury designers, such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Fendi, on the other.
MOB's totes—indeed, its very name—are a play on the classic “my other car ...” novelty bumper stickers, which can be seen
on inexpensive, beat up cars across the country informing passersby—with tongue firmly in cheek—that the driver's “other
car” is a Mercedes (or some other luxury car brand). The “my other car” bumper stickers are, of course, a joke—a riff, if you
will, on wealth, luxury brands, and the social expectations of who would be driving luxury and non-luxury cars. MOB's totes
are just as obviously a joke, and one does not necessarily need to be familiar with the “my other car” trope to get the joke or
to get the fact that the totes are meant to be taken in jest.

Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. (“Louis Vuitton”), the maker of Louis Vuitton bags, is perhaps unfamiliar with the “my other car”
trope. Or maybe it just cannot take a joke. In either case, it brings claims against MOB with respect to MOB totes that are
concededly meant to evoke iconic Louis Vuitton bags. More specifically, Louis Vuitton brings claims against MOB for
trademark dilution and infringement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c) ; a claim of trademark dilution under New
York law; and a claim of copyright infringement. MOB now moves for summary judgment on all of Louis Vuitton's claims;
Louis Vuitton cross moves for summary judgment on its trademark dilution claims and its copyright infringement claim, and
moves also to exclude the testimony of MOB's expert and to strike the declarations (or portions thereof) of MOB's expert
and MOB's founder and principal. For the reasons that follow, MOB's motion for summary judgment is granted and Louis
Vuitton's motions are all denied.

BACKGROUND

The relevant facts, taken from the Complaint and admissible materials submitted in connection with the pending motions,
are either undisputed or described in the light most favorable to Louis Vuitton. See Costello v. City of Burlington . 632 F.3d
41 , 45 (2d Cir.2011). Louis Vuitton is a world-renowned luxury fashion house known for its high-quality handbags and other
luxury goods. (Local Civil Rule 56.1 Statement Material Facts Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. Mot. Summ. J. (Docket No. 65)
(‘Louis Vuitton SOF”) ¢ 2). Louis Vuitton bags often sell for thousands of dollars ( see Def. My Other Bag's Statement
Undisputed Material Facts Pursuant Local Civil Rule 56.1 (Docket No. 53) (“MOB SOF”) § 13), and the company invests
substantial sums in creating and maintaining a sense of exclusivity and luxury, ( see id. J 14). As a result, several of Louis
Vuitton's designs and trademarks are famous and well-recognized icons of wealth and expensive taste. In particular, Louis
Vuitton's Toile Monogram design—‘“a repeating pattern featuring the interlocking, stylized letters ‘L’ and ‘V’ and three
stylized flower designs”

[156 F.Supp.3d 431]

(Louis Vuitton SOF 4 3), depictions of which appear in an appendix to this Opinion (“Op. App.”) ( see Op. App., Figs. A-B)—
has become “the defining signature of the Louis Vuitton brand,” (Louis Vuitton SOF § 4). Louis Vuitton has registered
trademarks in the Toile Monogram ( id. § 6) and in the component stylized flower designs, ( id. J 7). Two other iconic Louis
Vuitton designs, the Monogram Multicolore and the Damier, have achieved comparable levels of recognition and are also
registered as trademarks. ( See id. (9-21). By all accounts, and as the discussion below will make clear, Louis Vuitton
aggressively enforces its trademark rights. ( Id. 35).

MOB was founded by Tara Martin in 2011. (MOB SOF 4 11). As noted, the name “My Other Bag” was inspired by novelty


--- Page 2 ---
bumper stickers, which can sometimes be seen on inexpensive cars claiming that the driver's “other car” is an expensive,
luxury car, such as a Mercedes. (Decl. Tara Martin Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. (Docket No. 52) 43). MOB produces and
sells canvas tote bags bearing caricatures of iconic designer handbags on one side and the text “My Other Bag ...” on the
other. Several of MOB's tote bags—one of which is depicted in the appendix to this Opinion ( see Op. App., Figs. C-D)—
display images concededly designed to evoke classic Louis Vuitton bags. ( See MOB SOF {ff 21-22; Louis Vuitton SOF {[{
55-59, 79-80). As the appendix illustrates, the drawings use simplified colors, graphic lines, and patterns that resemble Louis
Vuitton's famous Toile Monogram, Monogram Multicolore, and Damier designs, but replace the interlocking “LV” and “Louis
Vuitton” with an interlocking “MOB” or “My Other Bag.” ( See also id. J§ 47, 49). MOB markets its bags as “[e]co-friendly,
sustainable tote bags playfully parodying the designer bags we love, but practical enough for everyday life.” (Decl. Sharon
Calhoun Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. (Docket No. 66) (“Calhoun Decl.”), Ex. 25 at LVMA7194). While
Louis Vuitton sells its handbags for hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars apiece, MOB's totes sell at prices between thirty
and fifty-five dollars. (Louis Vuitton SOF { 42). Its website and other marketing play up the idea that high-priced designer
bags cannot be used to carry around, say, dirty gym clothes or messy groceries, while its casual canvas totes can. (Calhoun
Decl., Ex. 25 at LVMA7190-LVMA7192 (“[T]his luncheon worthy designer bag doesn't fit in at the gym, BUT My Other Bag ...
DOES ....”); see also Louis Vuitton SOF 4 65).

THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate where the admissible evidence and the pleadings demonstrate “no genuine dispute as to
any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) ; see also Johnson v.
Killian , 680 F.3d 234 , 236 (2d Cir.2012) (per curiam). A dispute over an issue of material fact qualifies as genuine “if the
evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a judgment for the nonmoving party.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby. Inc.
477 U.S. 242 , 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) ; accord Roe v. City of Waterbury , 542 F.3d 31 , 35 (2d
Cir.2008). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett 477 U.S. 317 , 325,106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . “In moving for summary judgment
against a party who will bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial, the movant's burden will be satisfied if he can point to an
absence of evidence to support an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim.”_Goenaga v. March of Dimes Birth
Defects Found. , 51 F.3d 14 , 18 (2d Cir.1995) (citing Celotex._ 477 U. S. Reports 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548 ); accord

[156 F.Supp.3d 432]

PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca— Cola Co... 315 F.3d 101 , 105 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam).

In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, all evidence must be viewed “in the light most favorable to the non-moving
party,” Overton v. N.Y. State Div. of Military & Naval Affairs. 373 F.3d 83 , 89 (2d Cir.2004), and the court must “resolve all
ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought,”
Sec. Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc... 391 F.3d 77 , 83 (2d Cir.2004). When, as in this case, both
sides move for summary judgment, the district court is “required to assess each motion on its own merits and to view the
evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of that
party.” Wachovia Bank, Nat'l Ass'n v. VCG Special Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd. , 661 F.3d 164 , 171 (2d Cir.2011). Thus,
“neither side is barred from asserting that there are issues of fact, sufficient to prevent the entry of judgment, as a matter of
law, against it.” Heublein, Inc. v. United States , 996 F.2d 1455 , 1461 (2d Cir.1993).

To defeat a motion for summary judgment, a non-moving party must advance more than a “scintilla of evidence,” Anderson.
477 U. S. Reports 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , and demonstrate more than “some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,”
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp. , 475 U.S. 574 , 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348 , 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) . The
non-moving party “cannot defeat the motion by relying on the allegations in [its] pleading or on conclusory statements, or on
mere assertions that affidavits supporting the motion are not credible.” Gottlieb v. Cty. of Orange , 84 F.3d 511 , 518 (2d
Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Affidavits submitted in support of, or opposition to, summary judgment must be based on
personal knowledge, must “set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence,” and must show “that the affiant is
competent to testify to the matters stated therein.” Patterson v. Cty. of Oneida , 375 F.3d 206 , 219 (2d Cir.2004) (quoting
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) ).

DISCUSSION

As noted, Louis Vuitton asserts three categories of claims against MOB. First, Louis Vuitton brings trademark dilution claims
under both New York and federal law. (Compl. (Docket No. 2) § 73-80, 87-92). Second, Louis Vuitton alleges that MOB's
totes infringe its trademarks under federal law. ( /d. ¥{ 58-72). And third, Louis Vuitton contends that MOB's totes violate
federal copyright law. ( /d. 4 81-86). The Court will address each in turn.

A. Trademark Dilution

Louis Vuitton's principal claim is that MOB is liable for trademark dilution under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c), and
New York General Business Law § 360- /. The concept of trademark dilution has been described as a “subtle” one, Tiffany
(NJ) Inc. v. eBay, Inc.__576 F.Supp.2d 463 , 521-22 (S.D.N.Y.2008), affd in part, reversed in part on other grounds , and
calls for some explanation. “When an individual encounters a mark ( e.g. , a word or symbol) in a store or watching a


--- Page 3 ---
commercial, he or she can develop an association between a product or service and its corresponding quality, brand
reputation, or origin.” 1A Lindey on Entertainment, Publishing and the Arts § 2:52.50 (3d ed., updated Jan. 2016). Anti-
dilution laws protect those acquired associations from being diluted by other uses of a plaintiff's trademark. In particular,
dilution by blurring—the claim that Louis Vuitton pursues here—refers to the gradual diminishment of a famous mark's
acquired “ability ... to clearly and unmistakably

[156 F.Supp.3d 433]

distinguish one source through unauthorized use.” Hormel Foods Corp. v. Jim Henson Prods., Inc. _73 F.3d 497 , 506 (2d
Cir.1996) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Allied Maint. Corp. v. Allied Mech. Trades. Inc.
42 N.Y.2d 538 , 544, 399 N.Y.S.2d 628 , 369 N.E.2d 1162 (1977) (observing that New York law protects against the “gradual
whittling away of a firm's distinctive trade-mark or name”). ‘In other words, “dilution occurs when the unauthorized use of a
famous mark reduces the public's perception that the mark signifies something unique, singular, or particular.” H.R. Rep. No.
109-23, at 4 (2005), as reprinted in 2006 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1091, 1092.

The classic case of dilution by blurring involves an unrelated product coopting a famous name or trademark as its own
—“hypothetical anomalies” such “as Dupont shoes, Buick aspirin tablets, Schlitz varnish, Kodak pianos, Bulova gowns, and
so forth.” Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc. , 588 F.3d 97 , 106 (2d Cir.2009) (“ Starbucks Corp. !”) (internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Visa Int'l Serv. Ass'n v. JSL Corp. , 610 F.3d 1088 , 1090 (9th Cir.2010) (giving “Tylenol
snowboards, Netscape sex shops and Harry Potter dry cleaners” as examples of dilution by blurring (internal quotation
marks omitted)). In each of those cases, the new use of the famous trademark may cause “consumers [to] form new and
different associations with the plaintiff's mark,” thereby diluting the value of that mark. Visa Intern.__610 F.3d at 1090 . For
example, “the owner of a trademark for a famous handbag could sue another company that begins using the trademark to
refer to laundry detergent.” H.R. Rep. No. 112-647, at 5 (2012), as reprinted in 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. 559, 562; see also
Hormel, 73 F.3d at 506 (‘The legislative history of § 368-— d.... giv[es] examples of hypothetical violations: ‘DuPont shoes,
Buick aspirin tablets, Schlitz varnish, Kodak pianos, Bulova gowns, and so forth.’ ” (quoting 1954 N.Y. Legis. Ann. 49-50)). In
that example, the laundry detergent's use of the handbag's trademark would diminish the trademark's ability to “clearly and
unmistakably” identify the handbag. Over time, consumers might come to identify the trademark interchangeably with both
the detergent and the handbag, “whittling away” the distinctiveness and value of the handbag maker's mark. See Visa Int'l.
610 F.3d at 1090 (“[D]ilution by blurring ... occurs when a mark previously associated with one product also becomes
associated with a second.”).

To succeed on a dilution claim under federal law, a plaintiff “must prove (1) that the trademark is truly distinctive or has
acquired secondary meaning, and (2) a likelihood of dilution ... as a result of ‘blurring.’ ” Ergowerx Int'l, LLC v. Maxell Corp.
of Am. , 18 F.Supp.3d 430, 451 (S.D.N.Y.2014) (quoting_Strange Music, Inc. v. Strange Music, Inc. , 326 F.Supp.2d 481 ,
496 (S.D.N.Y.2004) ). A plaintiff need not show economic injury. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c) (providing for liability “regardless
of the presence or absence ... of actual economic injury”). New York law is similar, but does not require proof that the
plaintiffts mark is famous. See Hormel_, 73 F.3d at 505 —06. In assessing whether dilution by blurring is likely to occur under

[156 F.Supp.3d 434]

federal law, a court “may consider all relevant factors,” including the following six statutorily enumerated factors: (1) the
degree of similarity between the challenged mark and the famous mark; (2) the degree of distinctiveness of the famous
mark; (3) the extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in exclusive use of the mark; (4) the degree of
recognition of the famous mark; (5) whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the
famous mark; and (6) any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)
(B). The analysis, however, “must ultimately focus on whether an association, arising from the similarity between the subject
marks, impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark”—that is, the ability of the famous mark to serve as a unique identifier.
Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc. , 736 F.3d 198 , 204 (2d Cir.2013) (“ Starbucks Corp. II”) (internal quotation
marks omitted); see also N.Y. Stock Exch. v. N.Y., N.Y. Hotel LLC , 293 F.3d 550 , 558 (2d Cir.2002). Under New York law,
courts look to a similar set of factors: “(i) the similarity of the marks; (ii) the similarity of the products covered; (iii) the
sophistication of the consumers; (iv) the existence of predatory intent; (v) the renown of the senior mark; and (vi) the renown
of the junior mark.” N.Y. Stock Exch._, 293 F.3d at 558 . But again, those factors are only guideposts: The ultimate question
under New York law is whether there is a likelihood that the capacity of the senior owner's mark “to serve as a unique
identifier of its source” will be diminished. Louis Vuitton Malletier v. Dooney & Bourke, Inc.__561 F.Supp.2d 368 , 393
(S.D.N.Y.2008). 2

Significantly, federal law provides that certain uses of a mark “shall not be actionable as dilution by blurring,” including:

Any fair use ... of a famous mark by another person other than as a designation of source for the person's own
goods or services, including use in connection with ... identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon
the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous mark owner.

15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3).2 The statute does not define “parody,” but courts have explained that a “parody” is “a simple form of
entertainment conveyed by juxtaposing the irreverent representation of the trademark with the idealized image created by
the mark's owner.” Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. Haute Diggity Dog. LLC , 507 F.3d 252 , 260 (4th Cir.2007) (“ Haute Diggity
Dog”). “A parody must convey two simultaneous—and contradictory—messages: that it is the original, but also that it is not



--- Page 4 ---
the original and is instead a parody.” Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publ'g Grp.. Inc. . 886 F.2d 490 , 494 (2d
Cir.1989). The latter message “must not only differentiate the alleged parody from the original but must also

[156 F.Supp.3d 435]

communicate some articulable element of satire, ridicule, joking, or amusement.” Haute Diggity Dog_. 507 F.3d at 260 ; see
Cliffs Notes__ 886 F.2d at 496 (stating that a work “is a parody if, taken as a whole, it pokes fun at its subject”); Jordache
Enters., Inc. v. Hogg Wyld, Ltd., 828 F.2d 1482 , 1486 (10th Cir.1987) (“A parody relies upon a difference from the original
mark, presumably a humorous difference, in order to produce its desired effect.”).

1. Fair Use

Applying the foregoing standards here, the Court concludes as a matter of law that MOB's bags are protected as fair use—in
particular, that its use of Louis Vuitton's marks constitutes “parody.” As noted, a successful parody communicates to a
consumer that “an entity separate and distinct from the trademark owner is poking fun at a trademark or the policies of its
owner.” 6 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 31:153 (4th ed., updated Dec. 2015)
(‘McCarthy’). In other words, a parody clearly indicates to the ordinary observer “that the defendant is not connected in any
way with the owner of the target trademark.” /d. That is precisely what MOB's bags communicate. Indeed, the whole point is
0 play on the well-known “my other car ...” joke by playfully suggesting that the carrier's “ otherbag’—that is, not the bag
hat he or she is carrying—is a Louis Vuitton bag. That joke—combined with the stylized, almost cartoonish renderings of
Louis Vuitton's bags depicted on the totes—builds significant distance between MOB's inexpensive workhorse totes and the
expensive handbags they are meant to evoke, and invites an amusing comparison between MOB and the luxury status of
Louis Vuitton. Further, the image of exclusivity and refinery that Louis Vuitton has so carefully cultivated is, at least in part,
he brunt of the joke: Whereas a Louis Vuitton handbag is something wealthy women may handle with reverent care and
display to communicate a certain status, MOB's canvas totes are utilitarian bags “intended to be stuffed with produce at the
supermarket, sweaty clothes at the gym, or towels at the beach.” (Mem. Law Def. My Other Bag, Inc. Supp. Mot. Summ. J.
(Docket No. 56) (“MOB's Mem.”) 24).

Louis Vuitton protests that, even if MOB's totes are a parody of something , they are not a parody of its handbags and,
relatedly, that MOB's argument is a post hoc fabrication for purposes of this litigation. (Louis Vuitton's Mem. 17-20, 23). The
company notes that MOB's Chief Executive Officer, Tara Martin, has referred to its bags as “iconic” and stated that she
never intended to disparage Louis Vuitton. ( /d. at 18-19; see also Calhoun Decl., Ex. 25, at LVMA0001390 (MOB website
describing its bags as “an ode to handbags women love”). Thus, Louis Vuitton argues, the “My Other Bag ...” joke mocks
only MOB itself or, to the extent it has a broader target, “any humor is merely part of a larger social commentary, not a
parody directed towards Louis Vuitton or its products.” ( /d. at 19). In support of those arguments, Louis Vuitton relies heavily
on its victory in an unpublished 2012 opinion from this District: Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Hyundai Motor Am. , No. 10—
CV-1611 (PKC), 2012 WL 1022247 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2012). In that case, Hyundai aired a thirty-second commercial titled
“Luxury,” which included “a four-second scene of an inner-city basketball game played on a lavish marble court with a gold
hoop.” /d. at *1. The scene also included a basketball bearing marks meant to evoke the Louis Vuitton Toile Monogram. See
id. The Court rejected Hyundai's parody defense based in large part on deposition testimony from Hyundai representatives
that conclusively established that the car company had no intention for

[156 F.Supp.3d 436]

the commercial to make any statement about Louis Vuitton at all. See id. at *17-19 (excerpting deposition testimony
establishing that Hyundai did not mean to “criticize” or “make fun of” Louis Vuitton, or even “compare the Hyundai with
[Louis Vuitton]”). On the basis of that testimony, the Court concluded that Hyundai had “disclaimed any intention to parody,
criticize or comment upon Louis Vuitton” and that the ad was only intended to make a “broader social comment” about “what
it means for a product to be luxurious.” /d. at *17 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The Hyundai decision is not without its critics, see, e.g. , 4 McCarthy § 24:120, but, in any event, this case is easily
distinguished on its facts. Here, unlike in Hyundai, it is self-evident that MOB did mean to say something about Louis Vuitton
specifically. That is, Louis Vuitton's handbags are an integral part of the joke that gives MOB its name and features
prominently on every tote bag that MOB sells. In arguing otherwise, Louis Vuitton takes too narrow a view of what can
qualify as a parody. The quip “My Other Bag ... is a Louis Vuitton,” printed on a workhorse canvas bag, derives its humor
from a constellation of features—including the features of the canvas bag itself, society's larger obsession with status
symbols, and the meticulously promoted image of expensive taste (or showy status) that Louis Vuitton handbags have, to
many, come to symbolize. The fact that MOB's totes convey a message about more than just Louis Vuitton bags is not fatal
to a successful parody defense. See Campbell v. Acuff — Rose Music, Inc.__510 U.S. 569 , 580,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127
L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (holding that a copyright parodist must show that his parody, “ at least in part, comments on [the
parodied] author's work” (emphasis added)); Harley — Davidson, Inc. v. Grottanelli, 164 F.3d 806 , 813 (2d Cir.1999)
(applying that standard to trademark parody). And the fact that Louis Vuitton at least does not find the comparison funny is
immaterial; Louis Vuitton's sense of humor (or lack thereof) does not delineate the parameters of its rights (or MOB's rights)
under trademark law. See, e.g. , Cliffs Notes__886 F.2d at 495 —96 (‘“[T]he district court apparently thought that the parody
here had to make an obvious joke out of the cover of the original in order to be regarded as a parody. We do not see why
this is so. It is true that some of the covers of the parodies brought to our attention, unlike that of [the defendant], contain



--- Page 5 ---
obvious visual gags. But parody may be sophisticated as well as slapstick; a literary work is a parody if, taken as a whole, it
pokes fun at its subject.” (footnote omitted)); cf. Yankee Publ'g Inc. v. News Am. Publ'g Inc. , 809 F.Supp. 267 , 280
(S.D.N.Y.1992) (“Although [the defendant's] position would probably be stronger if its joke had been clearer, the obscurity of
its joke does not deprive it of First Amendment support. First Amendment protections do not apply only to those who speak
clearly, whose jokes are funny, and whose parodies succeed.”). 4

In those regards, another decision from this District,

Tommy Hilfiger Licensing. Inc. v. Nature Labs, LLC , 221 F.Supp.2d 410 , 415 (S.D.N.Y.2002), is more on point. That case
involved a line of parody perfume products for use on pets. In particular, the defendant had created a pet perfume called
Tommy Holedigger, which resembled a Tommy Hilfiger fragrance in name, scent, and packaging. See id. at 412-413.
Hilfiger, like Louis Vuitton here, argued (albeit in connection with a claim of trademark infringement rather than dilution) that
the defendant was not entitled to protection as a parody because “its product admittedly makes no comment about Hilfiger.”
Id. at 415. In support of that argument, Hilfiger cited testimony from the defendant's general partner that his product was not
intended to make any comment about Hilfiger or its products. See id. Noting that the general partner had also testified that
“he was intending to create a ‘parody ... target[ing] ... Tommy Hilfiger,’ ‘a fun play on words,’ or ‘spoof ... [t]o create
enjoyment, a lighter side,’ ” Judge Mukasey rejected Hilfiger's argument as follows:

Although [the general partner] had difficulty expressing the parodic content of his communicative message,
courts have explained that:

Trademark parodies ... do convey a message. The message may be simply that business and product images
need not always be taken too seriously; a trademark parody reminds us that we are free to laugh at the images
and associations linked with the mark. The message also may be a simple form of entertainment conveyed by
juxtaposing the irreverent representation of the trademark with the idealized image created by the mark's owner.

Id. (quoting_L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc. , 811 F.2d 26 , 34 (1st Cir.1987) ). He added, in a comment that applies
equally well here: “One can readily see why high-end fashion brands would be ripe targets for such mockery.” /d.

Alternatively, relying principally on_Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd. , 604 F.2d 200 (2d Cir.1979)
, Louis Vuitton argues that MOB's totes cannot be a parody because they do not need to use Louis Vuitton's trademarks for
the parody to make sense. (Louis Vuitton's Mem. 21-22). Strictly speaking, that is true—to the extent that MOB could use
any well-known luxury handbag brand to make its points. But, whereas the defendant in Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders , a
purveyor of a “gross and revolting sex film,” 604 F.2d at 202 , did not have to use anyone else's trademark—let alone the
plaintiffs specific trademark—to make its point (allegedly, “comment[ing] on ‘sexuality in athletics,’ ” id. at 206 ), the same
cannot be said here. MOB's tote bags would not make their point, and certainly would not be funny, if the obverse of the tote
merely depicted some generic handbag. Such a tote would confusingly communicate only that “my other bag ... is some
other bag.” In other words, Louis Vuitton's argument distorts any “necessity” requirement beyond recognition, and myopically
suggests that, where a parody must evoke at least one of a finite set of marks in order to make its point, it can evoke none of
hem because reference to any particular mark in the set is not absolutely necessary. The Court declines to create such an
illogical rule.

Finally, Louis Vuitton contends that the fair use exception does not apply to MOB's totes because MOB uses Louis Vuitton's
rademarks “as a designation of source for [MOB's] own goods.” (Louis Vuitton's Mem. 17-18). After all, Section 1125(c)(3),
by its terms, protects “[a]ny fair use ... of a famous mark by another person other than as a designation of source for the
person's own goods or services .”

156 F.Supp.3d 438]

15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3) (emphasis added); see also Haute Diggity Dog__ 507 F.3d at 266 (“Under the statute's plain
language, parodying a famous mark is protected by the fair use defense only if the parody is not‘a designation of source for
he person's own goods or services.’ ”). But given the overall design of MOB's tote bags (the identical, stylized text “My
Other Bag ...” on one side and differing caricatures on the other side), and the fact that the bags evoke a range of luxury
brands with different graphics, there is no basis to conclude that MOB uses Louis Vuitton's marks as a designation of source
or its tote bags. Indeed, as noted, that is the whole point of MOB's joke: “My otherbag’—that is, not this bag—is a Louis
Vuitton handbag. That joke—not to mention the cartoon-like rendering of the bags—builds significant distance between the
pattern incorporated into the bag sketches and the designated source of the totes themselves. Thus, MOB is not precluded
rom invoking the fair use provision.

Louis Vuitton's argument to the contrary rests on a single, mischaracterized citation to the record. (Louis Vuitton's Mem. 18).
At her deposition, MOB CEO Martin was asked:

Would you agree with me that these pictures that people see on [your totes] with whatever markings they have
are things that you use to designate where the goods come from? They designate your company? ... [WJould you
agree with me that the depictions of Louis Vuitton bags that you use on those totes that have depictions of Louis


--- Page 6 ---
Vuitton bags are depictions ... you use in order for people to understand that the product comes from you, My
Other Bag?

(Calhoun Decl., Ex. 3 (“Martin Dep. Tr.”) 88:23-89:1). Martin responded that, yes, “[p]eople know that the product ... our tote
bags with those depictions come from My Other Bag.” ( /d. ). That answer is not, as Louis Vuitton would have it, an
admission that MOB used its marks to identify the source of MOB's tote bags. Given the context—namely, counsel's attempt
to establish that consumers were likely to be confused about the origins of MOB's totes ( see id. at 88-90, 99-101)—it is
plain that Martin's sole point was that she did not believe that consumers were confused about who produces MOB's tote
bags. Louis Vuitton does not point to any other evidence that would demonstrate that MOB uses Louis Vuitton's marks as
designations of source for its own products or brand. ( SeeMem. PI. Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. Resp. Mot. Summ. J. My
Other Bag, Inc. (Docket No. 86) (“Louis Vuitton's Opp'n”) 4-5).

2. Dilution by Blurring

In short, MOB's use of Louis Vuitton's marks qualifies as fair use as a matter of law under Section 1125(c)(3). But even if it
did not—if, for example, MOB did use Louis Vuitton's marks as a designation of source—MOB would still be entitled to
summary judgment on Louis Vuitton's dilution claims because the tote bags pose no danger of impairing the distinctiveness
of Louis Vuitton's marks. As noted above, to succeed on its dilution claims—under both federal and New York law—Louis
Vuitton must show that MOB's bags are likely to blur Louis Vuitton's marks' “ability ... to clearly and unmistakably distinguish
one source” as a unique identifier. Hormel Foods, 73 F.3d at 506 (internal quotation marks omitted). £

[156 F.Supp.3d 439]

Significantly, it is not enough to show—as Louis Vuitton indisputably can—that members of the public are likely to
“associate” the defendant's mark with the plaintiff's mark (or that the defendant promotes such association). Under the
statute,

“association” is a necessary condition of, but not equivalent to, dilution by blurring .... Even if there is proof of a
likely association, that does not mean that there is also a likelihood of dilution by blurring. ... The statute explicitly
requires proof of the likelihood that this defendant's use “impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark.”

4 McCarthy § 24:116 ; see also Moseley, 537 U. S. Reports 433, 123 S.Ct. 1115 . Thus, the operative question is whether
the kind of association MOB creates here is likely to impair the distinctiveness of Louis Vuitton's marks.

With respect to that question, the Fourth Circuit's decision in Haute Diggity Dog —ironically, also involving Louis Vuitton—is
highly instructive. In Haute Diggity Dog , Louis Vuitton brought a trademark dilution claim against the manufacturer of pet
toys with names that humorously evoked various high-end brands, including a chew toy for dogs—a small, plush purse
decorated with a Toile Monogram-esque pattern—called “Chewy Vuiton.” 507 F.3d at 258 . The Court held that the fair use
exception for parodies in Section 1125(c)(3) did not apply because the defendant used Louis Vuitton's mark as a
designation of source for its own goods. See id. at 266. Nevertheless, the Court continued, federal law “does not require a
court to ignore the existence of a parody that is used as a trademark, and it does not preclude a court from considering
parody as part of the circumstances to be considered for determining whether the plaintiff has made out a claim for dilution
by blurring.” /d. at 266-67. To the contrary, the statute calls for consideration of “ ‘all relevant factors,’ including the six
factors supplied in § 1125(c)(2)(B),” with respect to several of which the use of a mark as parody is “specifically relevant.” /d.
at 267. The Fourth Circuit explained:

For example, factor (v) (whether the defendant intended to create an association with the famous mark) and
factor (vi) (whether there exists an actual association between the defendant's mark and the famous mark)
directly invite inquiries into the defendant's intent in using the parody, the defendant's actual use of the parody,
and the effect that its use has on the famous mark. While a parody intentionally creates an association with the
famous mark in order to be a parody, it also intentionally communicates, if it is successful, that it is not the
famous mark, but rather a satire of the famous mark. That the defendant is using its mark as a parody is
therefore relevant in the consideration of these statutory factors.

Similarly, factors (i), (ii), and (iv)—the degree of similarity between the two marks, the degree of distinctiveness of
the famous mark, and its recognizability—are directly implicated by consideration of the fact that the defendant's
mark is a successful parody. Indeed, by making the famous mark an object of the parody, a successful parody
might actually enhance the famous mark's distinctiveness by making it an icon. The brunt of the joke becomes
yet more famous.

Id. (citation omitted). The Fourth Circuit concluded that the owner of a famous mark such as Louis Vuitton therefore had “an
increased burden to demonstrate that the distinctiveness of its famous marks is likely to be impaired by a successful

parody.” /d. Louis Vuitton failed to carry that burden. “Haute Diggity Dog,” the Court reasoned, “mimicked” Louis Vuitton's
“famous

[156 F.Supp.3d 440]

marks,” but “did not come so close to them as to destroy the success of its parody and, more importantly, to diminish the


--- Page 7 ---
[Louis Vuitton] marks' capacity to identify a single source.” /d. at 268. That is, although “Haute Diggity Dog intentionally
associated its marks,” it did so “only partially and certainly imperfectly, so as to convey the simultaneous message that it was
not in fact a source of [Louis Vuitton] products. Rather, as a parody, it separated itself from the [Louis Vuitton] marks in order

to make fun of them.” /d. at 268.

The Court agrees with the Fourth Circuit's analysis in Haute Diggity Dog , and reaches the same conclusion in this case for
substantially the same reasons. See also Starbucks Corp. |. 588 F.3d at 112 —13 (quoting at length from Haute Diggity Dog
, but ultimately withholding judgment on whether to adopt the Fourth Circuit's “parody holding”). Here, as in Haute Diggity
Dog, “when considering factors (ii), (iii), and (iv), it is readily apparent ... that [Louis Vuitton's] marks are distinctive, famous,
and strong.” 507 F.3d at 267 . But as in Haute Diggity Dog , that fame and recognition only make it/ess likely that MOB's use
would impair the distinctiveness of Louis Vuitton's marks. See id. Nor is there any serious question that the drawings on
MOB's totes are similar to Louis Vuitton's bags (factor (i)) in a way that was intended to create an association with Louis
Vuitton's bags (factors (v) and (vi)). But while MOB deliberately uses, or at least evokes, Louis Vuitton's trademarks, it does
so in a way quite different from the hypothetical seller of “Buick aspirin tablets.” See Starbucks Corp. |, 588 F.3d at 105 .
Instead, MOB “intentionally associated its marks, but only partially and certainly imperfectly, so as to convey the

simultaneous message that it was not in fact a source of [Louis Vuitton] products.” Haute Diggity Dog_. 507 F.3d at 268 . In
fact, if anything, MOB distances itself from Louis Vuitton even more than Haute Diggity Dog did, as the very point of the “my
other bag” gimmick is that the MOB tote is nota Louis Vuitton handbag. Thus, “when considering the relevant factors to
determine whether blurring is likely to occur in this case,” the Court “readily come[s] to the conclusion,” as the Fourth Circuit
did in its case, “that [Louis Vuitton] has failed to make out a case of trademark dilution by blurring by failing to establish that
the distinctiveness of its marks was likely to be impaired” by MOB's marketing and sale of its products. /d.

B. Trademark Infringement

Next, the Court turns to Louis Vuitton's trademark infringement claims. &“The crucial issue in an action for trademark
infringement is whether there is any likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers are likely to be
misled, or indeed simply confused, as to the source of the goods in question.” Savin Corp. v. Savin Grp. , 391 F.3d 439 , 456
(2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). To determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion,
courts in this Circuit apply the eight-factor balancing test first articulated by Judge Friendly in Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad
Elecs. Corp. , 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir.1961) . The eight factors are: (1) strength of the trademark; (2) similarity of the marks; (3)
proximity of the products and their competitiveness

[156 F.Supp.3d 441]

with one another; (4) evidence that the senior user may “bridge the gap” by developing a product for sale in the market of
the alleged infringer's product; (5) evidence of actual consumer confusion; (6) evidence that the imitative mark was adopted
in bad faith; (7) respective quality of the products; and (8) sophistication of consumers in the relevant market. See Star
Indus., Inc. v. Bacardi & Co. Ltd_, 412 F.3d 373 , 384 (2d Cir.2005). But much like application of the statutory factors used to
evaluate trademark dilution claims, application of the Polaroid test is “not mechanical, but rather, focuses on the ultimate
question of whether, looking at the products in their totality, consumers are likely to be confused.” /d. Furthermore, as the
Second Circuit has recognized, normal application of the Polaroid test, which developed in the context of “purely commercial
exploitation,” is “at best awkward in the context of parody, which must evoke the original and constitutes artistic expression.”
Cliff s Notes__ 886 F.2d at 495 n. 3.

Applying the Polaroid factors here, the Court concludes that Louis Vuitton's infringement claims fail for much the same
reasons that its dilution claims failed. See Tommy Hilfiger._221 F.Supp.2d at 422 (noting that “many of the factors” relevant
0 the likelihood of dilution are “also relevant” to the likelihood of confusion). Beginning with the first factor—the strength of
Louis Vuitton's trademark—it is undisputed (indeed, indisputable) that Louis Vuitton's marks are famous. ( See Louis Vuitton
SOF 4{ 1-2). “In the usual trademark case, a strong mark is a factor pointing toward a likelihood of confusion. However,
where the plaintiffs mark is being used as part of a jest ... the opposite can be true. The strength and recognizability of the
mark may make it easier for the audience to realize that the use is a parody and a joke on the qualities embodied in
rademarked word or image.” Tommy Hilfiger. 221 F.Supp.2d at 416 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations
omitted); see also Haute Diggity Dog, 507 F.3d at 261 (‘It is a matter of common sense that the strength of a famous mark
allows consumers immediately to perceive the target of the parody, while simultaneously allowing them to recognize the
changes to the mark that make the parody funny or biting”). Such is the case here: Louis Vuitton's marks are so well known
hat consumers are likely “both immediately to recognize the target of the joke and to appreciate the obvious changes to the
marks that constitute the joke.” Tommy Hilfiger_221 F.Supp.2d at 416 . In that way, the distinctiveness of Louis Vuitton's
mark favors MOB—or, at most, is neutral.

As for the similarity of the marks, “an inquiry into the degree of similarity between two marks does not end with a

comparison of the marks themselves.” Hormel Foods_. 73 F.3d at 503 (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, “[o]ne
must also look to context, because ‘the setting in which a designation is used affects its appearance and colors the
impression conveyed by it.’” Tommy Hilfiger_221 F.Supp.2d at 417 (quoting Hormel Foods_, 73 F.3d at 503 ). Viewed in that
way, the second Polaroid factor also favors MOB. There are, to be sure, similarities—intended similarities—between the
bag-within-a-bag depicted on MOB's tote bags and Louis Vuitton's marks. ( Compare Op. App., Fig. B with Op. App., Figs.



--- Page 8 ---
C-D). At the same time, there are obvious differences: MOB's depiction is cartoonish; “MOB” is substituted for the well-
known interlocking “LV”; and the drawing appears on only one side of a workhouse canvas bag, with the name of the
company (“My Other Bag ...”) printed in large letters on the other side followed by an ellipsis, inviting the observer to
complete the joke. Those differences, “together with the context and overall setting ... convey

[156 F.Supp.3d 442]

to the ordinary viewer that this is a joke, not the real thing,” meaning that “confusion as to source, sponsorship, affiliation, or
connection is unlikely.” 6 McCarthy § 31:155.

The next two Polaroid factors—proximity of the products and likelihood that plaintiff will “bridge the gap’—also support MOB.
Louis Vuitton argues that its handbags “are directly competitive” with MOB's totes and “attract similar consumers.” (Louis
Vuitton's Opp'n 23). In particular, Louis Vuitton argues that, just like MOB, many of Louis Vuitton's bags are “casual” and
made of canvas. ( See Louis Vuitton SOF §§ 27-29). But that claim does not withstand even light scrutiny. As Louis Vuitton
repeatedly emphasizes, the company “is a premier luxury fashion house” that sells “high quality handbags, luggage, apparel,
and many other fashion and luxury goods.” (Louise Vuitton's Mem. 2). Its handbags cost hundreds, if not thousands of
dollars, and are “sold exclusively in Louis-Vuitton owned stores and on the e-commerce website, www.|louisvuitton.com.”
(Louis Vuitton SOF § 34; MOB SOF 13). By contrast, MOB's totes are sold on its website, www.myotherbag.com, and
retail for only between thirty and fifty-five dollars. ( See, e.g. , Calhoun Decl., Ex. 25, at LVMA0001303, LVMA0001470;
Louis Vuitton SOF 4 42). In short, MOB's bags are in no meaningful sense “competitive” with Louis Vuitton's designer
handbags. See, e.g. , Tommy Hilfiger 221 F.Supp.2d at 418 (finding that the third Polaroid factor favored the defendant
because the plaintiff's and defendant's products, although similar in some respects, were “sold in different kinds of stores—
the former in department or designer stores, the latter in pet stores or gift shops—at markedly different prices”); accord
Haute Diggity Dog__507 F.3d at 263 . Nor has Louis Vuitton put forward any evidence suggesting that it plans to “bridge the
gap” by selling casual parody totes at low price points.

The fifth factor, evidence of actual consumer confusion, also weighs in MOB's favor. In support of its argument to the
contrary, Louis Vuitton points to a handful of instances in which people have described certain MOB totes as “LV” bags. (
See Louis Vuitton SOF 9 81-85). Even if those descriptions were taken literally, a handful of instances is hardly strong
evidence of actual consumer confusion. Moreover, there is reason not to take them literally: On their face, the comments are
plainly using “LV” as a shorthand to describe the MOB tote designs that evoke Louis Vuitton bags. That is, the anecdotes do
little more than indicate that consumers get the joke on MOB's totes; they do not suggest that any consumers actually
believed MOB's totes were produced or sponsored by Louis Vuitton. Given that MOB's totes have been on the market for
several years, the fact that Louis Vuitton cannot produce any actual evidence of consumer confusion suggests that MOB's
use of Louis Vuitton's marks does “not cause a meaningful likelinood of confusion.” Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc. , 191
F.3d 208 , 228 (2d Cir.1999), abrogated on other grounds by Moseley_. 537 U.S. 418 , 123 S.Ct. 1115 ; see also Cohn v.
Petsmart, Inc. , 281 F.3d 837 , 842-43 (9th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (“[S]ome evidence of actual confusion should have
become available if [the defendant's] coexisting use had created a genuine likelihood of confusion.”); Tommy Hilfiger._221
F.Supp.2d at 419 (“Where, as here, a product has been on the market for several years, the absence of evidence on this
point is considered a very significant deficiency.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Contrary to Louis Vuitton's contention (Louis Vuitton Opp'n 24), the sixth factor—the defendant's bad faith—does not
[156 F.Supp.3d 443]

count in its favor either. Louis Vuitton relies on the fact that MOB intentionally designed its totes to evoke Louis Vuitton's
bags, as to which there is—and can be—no dispute. ( /d. ) In the context of parody, however, “[t]hat evidence ... does not
show that defendant acted with the intent relevant in trademark cases—that is, an intent to capitalize on consumer

deception or hitch a free ride on plaintiff's good will.” Tommy Hilfiger._221 F.Supp.2d at 419 . Instead, in that context, “the
intent is not necessarily to confuse the public but rather to amuse.” Jordache Enters.. Inc. v. Hogg Wyld, Ltd. . 828 F.2d 1482
, 1486 (10th Cir.1987). That is, “[t]he benefit to the one making the parody ... arises from the humorous association, not from
public confusion as to the source of the marks.” /d. ; see also, e.g. , Tommy Hilfiger. 221 F.Supp.2d at 419 (“The commercial
success of a parodist's product is attributable to consumers who purchased because ‘they were amused by the cleverness
of its design,’ and not because they believed it to be the original.” (quoting Anheuser — Busch, Inc. v. L. & L. Wings, Inc. 962
F.2d 316 , 322 (4th Cir.1992) ). Thus, MOB's intent “to imitate and suggest, but notuse , the marks of a high-fashion LOUIS
VUITTON handbag” is not the sort of “bad faith” that cuts in favor of a finding of infringement under the Polaroid test. Haute
Diggity Dog_, 507 F.3d at 268 ; cf. Jordache Enters._, 828 F.2d at 1487 (“Our single concern here ... is whether an intent to
parody an existing trademark supports an inference of a likelihood of confusion under the reasoning that one who chooses a
mark similar to an existing mark intends to confuse the public. We hold that it does not.” (citation omitted)).

Finally, the seventh and eighth Polaroid factors are either neutral or cut against Louis Vuitton. Louis Vuitton has not
demonstrated that the lower quality of MOB's totes threatens to tarnish its trademark. See Hormel Foods__ 73 F.3d at 505
(‘{A]n inferior product may cause injury to the plaintiff trademark owner because people may think that the senior and junior
products came from the same source.”). And it is uncontroverted that MOB's totes are not of the same quality as Louis
Vuitton's handbags in a way that might cause confusion as to source. ( See Louis Vuitton's Opp'n 24-25). So the seventh
factor, the quality of defendant's product, is at best a wash. The final factor considers the “sophistication of consumers and



--- Page 9 ---
the degree of care likely to be exercised in purchasing the product.” Tommy Hilfiger._221 F.Supp.2d at 420 . That factor
favors MOB for two reasons. First, “[t]he substantial price” of Louis Vuitton's handbags “requires buyers to exercise care
before they part with their money, and such sophistication generally militates against a finding of a likelihood of confusion.”
Charles of Ritz Grp. Ltd. v. Quality King Distribs.. Inc. , 832 F.2d 1317 , 1323 (2d Cir.1987). Second, MOB's gimmick would
be obvious to even its most unsophisticated customers, as one whole side of the tote bag is blank except for the words “My
Other Bag ....” ( See Op. App., Fig. C). Because the joke is “obvious, even a minimally prudent customer would not be
confused by the source or affiliation of [its products]. The purchasing public must be credited with at least a modicum of
intelligence.” Tommy Hilfiger, 221 F.Supp.2d at 420 (internal quotation marks omitted).

In sum, after considering all eight Polaroid factors and “looking at the products in their totality,” Star Indus.__412 F.3d at 384 ,
he Court concludes that “there is no triable issue of fact on the likelihood of confusion. Rather, defendant's use of the mark
is an obvious parody or pun, readily so perceived, and unlikely to cause confusion among consumers.” Tommy Hilfiger._221
F.Supp.2d at 420 . Nor does Louis Vuitton point to any evidence that the public might think Louis Vuitton “sponsored or
otherwise approved” of MOB's

156 F.Supp.3d 444]

bags. See Star Indus.__412 F.3d at 383 -84. Louis Vuitton suggests otherwise by hypothesizing the possibility of post-sale
confusion—specifically, an observer who sees only the side of the MOB tote bag with the bag-within-the-bag image and fails
‘0 notice that “MOB?” is substituted for “LV.” (Louis Vuitton's Opp'n 24). The Second Circuit, however, has generally found
post-sale confusion actionable only in the context of knockoffs, see Hermes Int'l v. Lederer de Paris Fifth Ave., Inc.__219
F.3d 104 , 108-09 (2d Cir.2000) (gathering cases), which is not the situation here. And in any event, the argument fails on
he merits. For one thing, no reasonable observer is likely to infer from the cartoon-like bag-within-the-bag design and the
juxtaposition of MOB's basic, canvas tote with the exclusive, luxury status of Louis Vuitton that Louis Vuitton sponsors or
otherwise approves of MOB's tote bags. For another, the test is not whether there is a likelihood of confusion in a
hypothetical scenario that is most likely to result confusion. Instead, the test is whether the “overall impression” created by
he product in the “context in which [it is] found” would cause confusion among reasonable “prospective purchasers.” Star
Indus.__412 F.3d at 386 . The “overall impression” of MOB's totes in the “context in which” reasonable prospective
purchasers would find them certainly includes both sides of the bag. And when the entirety of the bag is considered, there is
no credible risk that a reasonably prudent consumer would think Louis Vuitton “sponsored or otherwise approved” of MOB's
otes.

C. Copyright Infringement

Finally, MOB moves for summary judgment with respect to Louis Vuitton's copyright infringement claim. The Court's
conclusions above effectively compel the conclusion that any use by MOB of copyrightable elements of Louis Vuitton's
prints qualifies as a matter of law as “fair use.” See 17 U.S.C. § 107 (“[Flair use of a copyrighted work ... is not an
infringement of copyright.”). Parody, like other forms of comment or criticism, “has an obvious claim to transformative value”
and may therefore be “fair use” under the Copyright Act. Campbell, 510 U. S. Reports 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. “For the
purposes of copyright law, ... the heart of any parodist's claim to quote from existing material, is the use of some elements of
a prior author's composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's works.” /d. at 580, 114
S.Ct. 1164 . Of course, not all parody is protected; instead, parody, “like any other use, has to work its way through the
relevant factors, and be judged case by case, in light of the ends of the copyright law.” /d. at 581, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Thus, in
considering whether MOB's use of any copyrightable material is “fair,” the Court must consider the totality of the
circumstances, including the following factors: “(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational uses; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the
potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.” 17 U.S.C. § 107.

Because Louis Vuitton “attempts to use a copyright claim to pursue what is at its core a trademark and trade dress
infringement claim, application of the fair-use factors under the Copyright Act to these facts is awkward.” Haute Diggity Dog.
507 F.3d at 269 . Nevertheless, weighing the factors, the Court concludes that MOB's tote bags are protected by the fair use
doctrine. First, although commercial use “tends to weigh against a finding of fair use,” Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v.
Nation Enters. , 471 U.S. 539 , 562,105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) , it is not presumptively unfair. Parody, even
when

[156 F.Supp.3d 445]

done for commercial gain, can be fair use. See Campbell__510 U. S. Reports 584-85, 114 S.Ct. 1164. The second factor,
the nature of the copyrighted work, does not provide “much help ... in a parody case, since parodies almost invariably copy
publicly known, expressive works.” /d. at 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164. The third factor requires a court to assess whether “ ‘the
amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole’ ... are reasonable in relation to
the purpose of the copying.” /d. at 587, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 107(3) ). Here, MOB's use of Louis Vuitton's
patterns is reasonable in relation to the purpose of the use—after all, MOB's totes must successfully conjure Louis Vuitton's
handbags in order to make sense. Finally, although MOB's totes are, in an abstract sense, in the same market as Louis
Vuitton's handbags, its totes do not “serve[ ] as a market replacement for” Louis Vuitton's bags in a way that would make “it



--- Page 10 ---
likely that cognizable market harm to [Louis Vuitton] will occur.” /d. at 591, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Indeed, as discussed above, any
reasonable observer would grasp that the whole point of MOB's invocation of the “my other car ...” trope is to communicate
that MOB's totes are not replacements for Louis Vuitton's designer handbags. See Cariou v. Prince . 714 F.3d 694 , 707 (2d
Cir.2013) (“What is critical [in evaluating a fair use defense] is how the work in question appears to the reasonable
observer.”).

CONCLUSION

Louis Vuitton is, by its own description, an “active[ ] and aggressive [ ]” enforcer of its trademark rights. (Louis Vuitton SOF 4
35). In some cases, however, it is better to “accept the implied compliment in [a] parody” and to smile or laugh than it is to
sue. Tommy Hilfiger, 221 F.Supp.2d at 412 . This—like Haute Diggity Dog (and, arguably, Hyundai )—is such a case.
MOB's use of Louis Vuitton's marks in service of what is an obvious attempt at humor is not likely to cause confusion or the
blurring of the distinctiveness of Louis Vuitton's marks; if anything, it is likely only to reinforce and enhance the
distinctiveness and notoriety of the famous brand. Accordingly, and for the reasons stated above, MOB is entitled to
summary judgment on all of Louis Vuitton's claims; it follows that Louis Vuitton's own motion for partial summary judgment
must be and is denied.

In addition, Louis Vuitton's motions to preclude the expert testimony of William Locander (Docket No. 70) and to strike all or
portions of Locander's and MOB CEO Martin's declarations (Docket Nos. 82, 84) are denied as moot, as the Court did not
rely on any of the disputed submissions in resolving the parties' summary judgment motions. Finally, Louis Vuitton's motions
for oral argument (Docket No. 96) and for a conference regarding its motion to preclude expert testimony (Docket No. 101)
are also denied as moot.

The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate Docket Nos. 50, 62, 70, 82, 84, 96, and 101 and to terminate this case. 7
SO ORDERED.

Notes:

1Under federal and New York law, a trademark owner can also pursue a claim of dilution by tarnishment. See, e.g. , Deere & Co. v. MTD Prods., Inc.
41 F.3d 39 , 43 (2d Cir.1994) (“‘Tarnishment’ generally arises when the plaintiff's trademark is linked to products of shoddy quality, or is portrayed in an
unwholesome or unsavory context likely to evoke unflattering thoughts about the owner's product.”). In this case, Louis Vuitton alleges only dilution by
blurring. (Mem. PI. Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Docket No. 64) (“Louis Vuitton's Mem.”) 10).

2MOB contends that, under the Lanham Act, a plaintiff may bring a trademark dilution claim only where the defendant uses the plaintiff's mark to
designate the source of its goods—that is, as a mark—and that it does not use Louis Vuitton’s marks in that manner. (MOB's Mem. 5-9). The “mark-
versus-mark” theory finds support in at least one prominent authority, see 4 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition §
24:122 (4th ed., updated Dec. 2015), but the Court need not decide its validity in this case.

3 Although New York law does not include an analogous “fair use” provision, New York anti-dilution law is “substantively similar” to federal law, such that
claims under the two laws “may be analyzed together.” Tiffany. 576 F.Supp.2d at 523 . Accordingly, courts have held that when a defendant establishes
fair use for purposes of federal law, related state law claims also fail. See JA Apparel Corp. v. Abboud , 682 F.Supp.2d 294 , 317 (S.D.N.Y.2010).

4 Even if Hyundai were not distinguishable, this Court would decline to follow it. In the Court's view, the Hyundai Court blurred the distinction between
association and dilution. As discussed in more detail below, association is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a finding of dilution by blurring.
See, e.g. , Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc. . 537 U.S. 418 , 433, 123 S.Ct. 1115 , 155 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003) ( “[T]he mere fact that consumers mentally
associate the junior user's mark with a famous mark is not sufficient to establish actionable dilution. ... [S]uch mental association will not necessarily
reduce the capacity of the famous mark to identify the goods of its owner.”).

5 Under federal (but not New York) law, Louis Vuitton also has to show “that the trademark is truly distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning.”
Ergowerx , 18 F.Supp.3d at 451 (quoting_Strange Music, Inc. v. Strange Music, Inc. , 326 F.Supp.2d 481 , 496 (S.D.N.Y.2004) ). Here, there is—and can
be—no dispute that Louis Vuitton's trademarks are famous and distinctive. ( See MOB's Mem. 1-2, 5).

&Louis Vuitton's Complaint also raises a claim for false designation of source. ( See Compl. | 67-72). As discussed above, MOB does not use Louis
Vuitton's trademarks as a designation of source. In any event, false designation of source claims, like trademark infringement claims, require a plaintiff to
demonstrate a likelihood of consumer confusion. See Waldman Publ'g Corp. v. Landoll, Inc. 43 F.3d 775 , 780 (2d Cir.1994). As explained in this
section, Louis Vuitton cannot meet that burden.

2 Both parties filed some of their briefs under seal. Although there is a presumption in favor of public access to judicial documents, the Court does not
reference or otherwise rely on sealed facts in reaching its decision. The weight of that presumption is, therefore, limited. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga , 435 F.3d 110 , 119 (2d Cir.2016) ( “[T]he weight to be given the presumption of access must be governed by the role of the material at issue
in the exercise of Article III judicial power and the resultant value of such information to those monitoring the federal courts.” (quoting_United States v.
Amodeo , 71 F.3d 1044 , 1049 (2d Cir.1995) )). As for competing considerations that counsel in favor of allowing the parties to file their briefs under seal,
the privacy interests of the parties in preventing the public disclosure of private business figures and communications are not insignificant. The Court
therefore concludes that the balance of interests is in favor of allowing the parties’ briefs to be filed under seal. Leave to file under seal is therefore
granted.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
P. KEVIN CASTEL, District Judge:

The Institute for the Development of Earth Awareness (“IDEA”) has brought this action against the People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals (“PETA”), alleging that PETA has infringed IDEA'S copyrighted work The Dreaded
Comparison, authored by Marjorie Spiegel. The work purports to draw close parallels between forms of human oppression,
most notably, slavery in America and the present-day treatment of animals. PETA is said to have infringed the copyright by
publishing a series of WebPages and display boards comparing animal treatment to slavery and other human oppression, as
part of PETA's “Animal Liberation Project,” or “ ALP. ”

The lengthy and contentious discovery period has closed and PETA has moved for summary judgment on a variety of
grounds. For the reasons explained herein, the motion is granted. Assuming all other elements of a valid copyright
infringement claim are met, no reasonable jury could conclude that PETA has actually copied IDEA's copyrighted work. No

[768 F.Supp.2d 675]

reasonable jury could conclude that PETA engaged in unprotected copying of particularized expression, or copied an
original combination of unprotected elements.

BACKGROUND

For the purposes of this motion, only facts not disputed by the non-movant, IDEA, are accepted as true. All reasonable
inferences are drawn in favor of IDEA.

The copyrighted work, The Dreaded Comparison (“ TDC”), was authored by Marjorie Spiegel in 1988. 1 It is a softcover
book that is 128 pages in length, with a foreword by Alice Walker, author of the famous novel The Color Purple (1982). TDC
is a work with 86 endnotes referencing source materials. The work also contains a listing of recommended readings, a table
of contents and an index. The inside back cover solicits membership in IDEA and donations.

TDC describes many of the characteristics of the enslavement of Africans in America, including: painful journeys (e.g.,
the Middle Passage), high mortality, profit motives of slave-owners, auctions, painful punishment of slaves, branding,
secrecy surrounding abuses, separation from other family members, use of language of oppression and the power structure
between slave-owner and slave. There is a quote from novelist Zora Neale Hurston asserting in colorful language that
African American women were treated like mules. ( TDC at 109.) The work also discusses the 19th century slaughter of
natives of Patagonia, and states that it is “much like the scenario in North America's Midwest.” ( TDC at 89.) It also speaks in
several places of Native Americans' respect for animals. ( TDC at 15-16, 64.) TDC also discusses the characteristics of
ownership and treatment of various species of animals in modern society, including: painful transportation, cruelty,
vivisection, auctions, experimentation, 2 branding, hunting, profit motives of animal owners, use of language of oppression
and power over the animal. TDC develops its themes and ideas over many pages of original text. It draws from many
sources, including religious doctrines, social theory and trends, and contains many historical references. The work purports
to be a factual account of actual events and practices with the author's interpretation of them.

TDC contains black and white photographs and illustrations of both slavery and the treatment of animals. IDEA does
not claim copyright ownership in the individual depictions. There is no consistency in how the illustrations are presented.
Some depictions have comparison illustrations, one from slavery and one relating to animals, either on the same page ( see
e.g., TDC at 42, 53, 81, 84) or on pages that face each other. ( See e.g., TDC at 36-37, 54-55, 66-67, 68-69, 88-89, 92—
93, 96-97, 100-01.) Others are presented in a stand-alone manner with no comparative illustration. ( See e.g., TDC at 39,
41, 51, 56, 63, 74.)


--- Page 2 ---
TDC also contains about 65 quotations from well known and historical figures, including: St. Thomas Aquinas,
Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, John Stuart Mill, Roger B. Taney, Mark Twain,

[768 F.Supp.2d 676]

William Pitt, Zora Neale Hurston, J.R.R. Tolkein, Dick Gregory and Peter Singer. Some quotes are in block-quote form with
original text before and after. ( See e.g., TDC at 18, 34, 35, 56.) In many other instances the quotes stand apart from text,
including at the beginning of a chapter. ( See e.g., TDC at 15, 51, 79.) Many other quotes are assembled in a portion of the
book titled “What Others Have Said.” ( TDC at 107-113.) No copyright is claimed in the individual quotations.

According to PETA, its “Animal Liberation Project” (“ ALP”) 2was an outgrowth of a 2004 campaign titled “Holocaust on
Your Plate,” “comparing animal mistreatment to Nazi Holocaust victims.” (Carr Decl. 4 5; Reiman Decl. ¥ 5.) 4PETA's ALPis
not a single work, but rather, a series of WebPages posted principally from September 2005 to September 2006 and from
April 2008 until November 2009. Some of the ALP content was also displayed on enlarged poster boards at PETA events. In
part, the ALP is used to solicit donations.

PETA's ALP has separate WebPages for the topics of “Slavery,” “Native American Genocide,” “Oppression of Women”
and “Children's Welfare.” ( ALP at 1.) The “Slavery” page refers to the branding of slaves and animals, the oppressive
mentality of slave-owners and animal oppressors, beatings, lynchings, burnings and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. ( /d. at 3.)
There are two quotations on the slavery page: one from a PBS televised special and the other from Peter Singer, author of
the book Animal Liberation. The Peter Singer quote also appears in TDC. The quote in TDC is approximately 59 words in
length and is attributed to Singer with a date of 1974. ( TDC at 15.) The quote in ALP repeats approximately 29 of those
words. ( ALP at 3.) Notably, more than a decade before TDC, Singer in 1974 is said to have “compared” the treatment of
animals to the “centuries of tyranny by white humans over black humans.” ( TDC at 15; ALP at 3.) ALP's “Native American
Genocide” page refers to the brutal treatment of native peoples, but in no specific geographic location. ( ALP at 4.) The
“Oppression of Women” page contains statements such as, “[t]he idea that women were inferior to men was generally
accepted by society, and they were admonished to be submissive and obedient.” ( /d. at 5.)

The ALP relies heavily on color, images and graphics. A few pages have several paragraphs of text ( see e.g., ALP at
3, 18-22), but most pages contain a single quote or a paragraph or two of text. ( See e.g., ALP at 11, 27, 33.) One web
version of ALP uses the tag line: “We Are All Animals,” and opens with the following paragraph:

What is the common link between all atrocities in our society's past? Shameful chapters of history, such as the African
slave trade, the massacre and displacement of Native Americans, the oppression of women, and forced child labor, were the
products of a dangerous belief that those with power have the right to abuse those without it: that might somehow does
make right. Whether for profit, convenience, or just plain amusement, this supremacist attitude caused people as a society to
tolerate, perpetuate, and indignantly defend outrageously cruel acts.

( ALP at 1).
Some of the ALP WebPages use words (e.g., “Hanging”) in a large color font with
[768 F.Supp.2d 677]

a quote underneath (e.g., from Dick Gregory) and then side-by-side photos relating to slavery and animals (e.g., the
lynchings of African Americans and a hanging carcass of a steer). ( See e.g., ALP at 15.) The side-by-side photos feature
scenes of animal mistreatment next to a depiction of a purported human analogue. For example, on one page there is an
illustration of the shackled foot of a slave next to a photo of an elephant's foot in shackles. ( ALP at 9.) Another page of the
ALP contains a drawing of a slave branding scene that has elements in common with a branding drawing in the TDC (e.g.,
the person holding the branding iron has a striped shirt and moustache, has the device in his right hand and has it placed at
the back of topless African female with a white clothe wrapped around her lower torso; a boy stands next to them holding a
lantern). ( ALP at 29; TDC at 29.) The pages containing comparative photos also contain quotes. One page entitled
“Beaten,” includes a quote from Peter Singer that does not also appear in TDC. ( ALP at 10.) Another page includes a quote
from John Stuart Mill, also not appearing in TDC. ( Id. at 12.) A page entitled “Hanging,” contains a quote from Dick Gregory;
a lengthier version of the quote from Gregory appears in TDC. ( Id. at 15; TDC at 108.)

Images and quotations are not used in any consistent manner throughout the 78 pages that constitute the ALP. Some
pages display only a single image with no comparative image ( see e.g., ALP at 26, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42,
44, 45, 47, 48), but these images generally correspond to another page on which the same images are shown side-by-side.
( See e.g. ALP at 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40.) Images of the tools of human and animal oppression are displayed on interactive
WebPages. ( ALP at 64-74.) Some quotes appear two to a page. ( See e.g., ALP at 58-64.) Others are set off in a separate
colored box on a page with other text and illustrations. ( /d. at 2-4.) Some quotes are on pages with headings in large
colored lettering. ( See e.g., id. at 9-14.) Two quotes are on pages with other text, but no other quotes or illustrations. ( See
e.g., id. at 50-51.)


--- Page 3 ---
There is no dispute that PETA had access to and knowledge of TDC. It favorably reviewed TDC in its publications,
describing it as “ground-breaking” and a “real eye-opener!” (Langer Decl. Exs. 27 & 49.)

DISCUSSION I. Summary Judgment Standard

To give the reader a flavor of this dispute, the defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement of undisputed facts is 173 paragraphs
in length. In addition to responding to defendant's Statement, plaintiff offers a 146-paragraph Counter—Statement of its own.
While one might suppose that with dueling statements of this length this would not be an ideal case for summary judgment.
In actuality, many of the tendered “facts” relate to issues that are not necessary for this Court to reach, such as ownership of
a copyright in portions of the book and whether plaintiff could show actual damages.

A motion for summary judgment in a copyright infringement case is governed by the same standards as any other
motion made under Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P. Only material facts that are not disputed by the non-movant may be accepted as
true and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-movant. This Court has not hesitated to deny summary
judgment on the issue of substantial similarity in a copyright case where the evidentiary record so warrants. See, e.g. BMS
Entm't/Heat Music LLC v. Bridges, 04 Civ. 2584(PKC), 2005 WL 1593013 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2005), reconsideration denied,

[768 F.Supp.2d 678]

BMS Entm't/Heat Music LLC v. Bridges, 04 Civ. 2584(PKC), 2005 WL 2675088 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 2005). The familiar
standards governing a motion under Rule 56 need not be repeated here.

ll. Plaintiff has Failed to Establish Its Copyright Infringement Claim

To establish a claim of copyright infringement, IDEA must prove: “(i) ownership of a valid copyright; and (ii)
unauthorized copying of the copyrighted work.” Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony Records, 351 F.3d 46 , 51 (2d Cir.2003). While
PETA disputes IDEA's ownership of the copyright to the Foreword to TDC (a matter later addressed), it otherwise concedes
IDEA's ownership of a valid copyright to TDC. IDEA has established the first element of an infringement claim.

To establish unauthorized copying, IDEA must prove that its work was “ ‘actually copied’ and that the portion copied

amounts to an ‘improper or unlawful appropriation.’ ” /d. (quoting Castle Rock Enim't, Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Grp.. Inc., 150 F.3d
132 , 137 (2d Cir.1998)). The actual copying of the copyrighted work may be demonstrated by either direct or indirect
evidence. See id. “Because direct evidence of copying is seldom available, a plaintiff may establish copying circumstantially
‘by demonstrating that the person who composed the defendant's work had access to the copyrighted material,’ ” ... and that
there are similarities between the two works that are “probative of copying.” /d. (quoting Herzog v. Castle Rock Entm't, 193
F.3d 1241 , 1249 (11th Cir.1999) and Repp v. Webber. 132 F.3d 882 , 889 (2d Cir.1997)). PETA concedes access but
disputes that there are protectable similarities between the two works.

A. The Alleged Instance of Actual Copying is Protected Under the “Fair Use” Doctrine

The Foreword to TDC was authored by Alice Walker. 5It is one and one-quarter pages in length and consists of four
paragraphs of about 21 sentences in total. ( TDC at 13-14.) ALP quotes the following two sentences from the Foreword,
attributing the quote to Alice Walker and using quotation marks: “The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They
were not made for humans any more than black people were made for whites or women for men.” ( ALP at 81, attached at
Zissu Decl. at Ex. 17.)

“[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work ... for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching ...
scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” 17 U.S.C. § 107. Section 107 of the Copyright Act sets forth
the factors that a Court should consider in assessing the fair use defense: “(1) the purpose and character of the use,
including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the
copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.” /d. In analyzing the application of the
defense, “[t]he task is not to be simplified with bright-line rules, for the statute, like the doctrine it recognizes, calls for case-
by-case analysis.” Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 577-78, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) .
Each

[768 F.Supp.2d 679]

of the factors is explained and discussed in Blanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d 244 , 251-58 (2d Cir.2006). Fair use is an affirmative
defense, thus the burden of proof is on the proponent. See J/nfinity Broad. Corp. v. Kirkwood, 150 F.3d 104 , 107 (2d
Cir.1998).

The use of the Walker quote in ALP, in context, was transformative; it is located on a page with pictures of auctions of
animals and slaves with a heading of “Sold Off” in a large blue letters. ( ALP at 81, attached at Langer Decl., Ex. 11.) The
copying was intentional but the source, Alice Walker, was attributed and quotation marks were used. While PETA itself is a
nonprofit organization and seeks to educate the public, the ALP was used, in part, to solicit donations and, for the purpose of
the analysis, | assume that there was a commercial quality to the fund-raising. The nature of the copyrighted work is a book


--- Page 4 ---
that argues a position based upon facts, some of which are historical; the allegedly infringing work is a website and display
boards that also argue a position based upon facts some of which are historical. The amount of material taken from the
Foreword is slight and, when viewed as a portion of the overall TDC of 128 pages in length, it is an extremely small portion
of the text. The Walker quote is so small in comparison to the overall content of TDC (and ALP) that it could not have
affected the potential market for or value of the TDC. Comfortably and without further explication, the fair use defense is
established as a matter of law as to the two-sentence Walker quote. ©

B. The ALP is Not “Substantially Similar” to TDC 1. Unprotected Elements

As Justice Story famously observed, “ ‘[iJn truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if any,
things, which in an abstract sense, are strictly new and original throughout. Every book in literature, science and art,
borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known and used before.’ ” Campbell,_510 U. S.
Reports 575 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (alteration in original) (quoting Emerson v. Davies, 8 F.Cas. 615, 619 (No. 4,436) (CCD Mass.
1845)). “The most fundamental axiom of copyright law is that no author may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates.”
Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., Inc.. 499 U.S. 340 , 344-45, 111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (internal
quotation marks omitted). The text of the Copyright Act states that “[i]n no case does copyright protection for an original work
of authorship extend to any idea ... concept ... or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained,
illustrated, or embodied in such work.” 17 U.S.C. § 102(b). Copyright law does, however, protect a particularized expression
of an idea, although the underlying idea itself is not protectable. See Mattel, Inc. v. Azrak—Hamway Int'l. Inc., 724 F.2d 357 ,
360 (2d Cir.1983).

The idea of comparing slavery to treatment of animals (pretermitting the validity and worthiness of such a comparison)
is not entitled to copyright protection. As the TDC itself, notes, an 1898 publication of the British anti-vivisection movement
was first titled “Abolitionist” and later changed to “The Liberator,” the name of William Lloyd Garrison's anti-slavery
publication. ( TDC at 100-01.) Also, as noted previously, in 1974, long before TDC was written, Peter Singer “compared” the
treatment of animals to

[768 F.Supp.2d 680]

the “centuries of tyranny by white humans over black humans.” ( TDC at 15; ALP at 3.) Plaintiff is entitled to no protection for
even intentional copying of the idea of the comparison or in using the comparison to advocate for better treatment of
animals.

Nor are the descriptions of historical facts entitled to protection, as long as different forms of expression are used.
“Facts, whether alone or as part of a compilation, are not original and therefore may not be copyrighted.” Feist_499 U. S.
Reports 350 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 . Thus, the basic facts of slavery and the present day treatment of animals receive no
copyright treatment.

Under the scénes a faire doctrine, “sequences of events that ‘necessarily result from the choice of a setting or
situation,’ do not enjoy copyright protection.” Williams v. Crichton, 84 F.3d 581 , 587 (2d Cir.1996) (quoting Walker v. Time
Life Films, Inc., 784 F.2d 44 , 50 (2d Cir.1986)). Thus, for example, a scene describing life in the South Bronx (in the 1980s
or earlier) would likely contain “[e]lements such as drunks, prostitutes, vermin and derelict cars” and these elements would
not be entitled to copyright protection. Wa/ker,_784 F.2d at 50 . The ALP's description of the horrid conditions of slaves with
reference to terms used in TDC, such as branding, lynchings, the Middle Passage, family separations or auctions, do not
amount to infringement. The same is true for references to the slaughtering of animals, starving of animals, auctioning of
animals, chaining and restraint of animals or use of animals in experimentation; they are not protectable.

2. The Compilation of Unoriginal Elements

Unoriginal elements, when combined, may constitute an original work entitled to copyright protection. See Knitwaves,
Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd. (Inc.), 71 F.3d 996 , 1004 (2d Cir.1995). In Knitwaves, the Court concluded that a sweater's
commonplace visual elements—such as leaves and squirrels, a “ ‘fall’ palette” of colors, and a design that combined these
images and colors—were sufficiently original in combination to warrant copyright protection. /d. The Second Circuit rejected
the defendants’ contention “that, in comparing designs for copyright infringement, we are required to dissect them into their
separate components, and compare only those elements which are in themselves copyrightable.” /d. at 1003. “As the district
judge noted, if we took this argument to its logical conclusion, we might have to decide that there can be no originality ina
painting because all colors of paint have been used somewhere in the past.” /d. (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead,
Knitwaves emphasized that a court should evaluate a work's “total concept and feel.” /d. The undersigned has observed that
the “unoriginal lyrics of ‘Mary Had a Little Lamb’ with the unoriginal melody of ‘Old McDonald’ and an unoriginal reggae beat”
could amount to an original work protectable under the copyright law. BMS Entm't/Heat Music, 2005 WL 1593013 at *3 n. 2.

IDEA asserts that within its copyrighted work there are unprotected elements that, when combined, form an original,
protectable work copied by PETA. It asserts that the two works are substantially similar. “In most cases, the test for
‘substantial similarity’ is the so-called ‘ordinary observer test’ ....” i.e., whether “an average lay observer would [ ] recognize
the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work.” Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1002 (internal quotation
marks omitted). In applying the ordinary observer test, the Second Circuit has “endorsed the notion that, ‘[glood eyes and


--- Page 5 ---
common sense may be as useful as deep study of reported and unreported cases, which themselves are tied to highly

[768 F.Supp.2d 681]

particularized facts.’ ” Hamil Am. Inc. v. GFI, 193 F.3d 92 , 102 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting Soptra Fabrics Corp. v. Stafford
Knitting Mills. Inc., 490 F.2d 1092 , 1093 (2d Cir.1974)). When comparing two works that “contain both protectible and
unprotectible elements ... [the] inspection must be ‘more discerning;’ we must attempt to extract the unprotectible elements
from our consideration and ask whether the protectible elements, standing alone, are substantially similar.” /d. at 1002
(emphasis in original).

IDEA relies upon the report of James Engell, a Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Harvard University.
He is an expert on, among other things, the works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. (Engell Rpt., attached at Langer Decl. Ex. 3.)
Professor Engell finds a combination of five distinct and protectable elements in TDC that are also present in ALP. This
Court will discuss each separately and, then, in combination.

“(1) an argument that human beings with effective power over animals often abuse those animals in a manner
comparable to the way humans especially but not exclusively in the case of chattel, race slavery, have abused
other humans over whom they have similar power.” (Engell Rpt. at { 1.)

The two works, indeed, posit the foregoing argument. As noted from the references to the “Abolitionist,” “The Liberator”

and Peter Singer, these arguments are not original to TDC. Moreover, as discussed above, they are unprotectable ideas
based largely on facts, many of a historical nature.

“(2) an explanatory text that elaborates this comparative argument about power, oppression, and abuse from
historical, philosophical, and ethical perspectives.” ( Id. at | 1.)

The two works are quite different in the manner in which they advance their arguments. TDC is a standard softcover

book, containing principally text in support of the author's thesis, together with illustrations. ALP relies heavily on color and
graphics and much less on text. Each makes arguments from history and each advances perspectives that could be
characterized as “philosophical,” “ethical” or both. PETA is an organization that, in its very name, seeks “ethical treatment of
animals.” In the absence of copying expression, there is no protectable originality in the abstract proposition of “an
explanatory text that elaborates this comparative argument about power, oppression, and abuse from historical,
philosophical, and ethical perspectives.” ( Id. at J 1.)

“ (3) quotations, frequently acting as epigraphs for divisions of the text or in conjunction with illustrations, often
Paired, but otherwise prominently placed or highlighted, and consisting of a grammatically complete sentence or
sentences, not short phrases.” ( Id. at J 1.)

Both works use quotations and the quotations tend to be sentences, whether or not grammatically complete. TDC
contains a separate section of the book, six pages in length, titled “What Others Have Said,” that contains the text of twelve

quotations followed by the name of the person quoted without any explanatory text (with one exception) or illustration. ( TDC
at 107-13.) Some of the quotes are one sentence in length but one is over three pages in length. ( /d. at 110-13.) These
quotes do not serve as epigraphs for divisions of the text. True, some quotes are at the beginning of a chapter, as is

commonplace in political or historical works. ( See e.g., id. at 39.) Some are in the middle of a chapter next to an illustration.
( See e.g. id. at 42.) Some are in traditional block

[768 F.Supp.2d 682]

quote form with original material preceding and following the quote. ( See e.g., id. at 25-26, 43.) The ALP also uses quotes.
One of the quotes in the ALP, as discussed above, is a brief and attributed quote from Alice Walker's Foreword in TDC.
Some of the quotes are placed with one other quote and two illustrations on pages of a faux antique book. ( ALP at 57-63.)
Some are set off in a separate and colored box on a page with other text and illustrations. ( /d. at 2-4.) Some are on pages
with headings in a large colored font (e.g., “Beaten” “Force—Fed” “Liberation”). ( /d. at 9-16.) Two are on pages with other
text, no other quotes and no illustrations. ( /d. 50-51.) There is nothing original or distinctive in the several and varied ways
in which quotes are utilized in the TDC that are copied in the ALP.

“(4) division of the work and its explanatory texts into more detailed parallels that compare abusive treatments of
animals with specific abusive treatments of race slaves or other people who were at times oppressed (e.g. Native
Americans, Jews).” (Engell Rpt. at { 1.)

Both works contain divisions of themes. The absence of anything original or distinctive in the manner of divisions is well

demonstrated by recounting the thirteen chapter headings in TDC: An Historical Understanding; Oppression in Language
and Literature; Slaves and Masters; Social Relations: The Destruction of Security; Transportation, or The Unbearable
Journey; Hunting; Vivisection; In Defense of Slavery; Secrecy: Hiding from the Truth; Profits Over All; Power; Afterword to

the Revised Edition; What Others have Said. ( TDC at “Contents.”) While the overall theme of TDC is the comparison of


--- Page 6 ---
animal treatment to slavery and other forms of oppression of humans, the manner in which the work is organized is not
distinctive or original. The central idea of TDC is to make a comparison. Unsurprisingly, many comparisons of the facets and
features of human oppression and animal treatment are set forth in the book. ALP makes comparisons and uses headings
to divide subject areas, but it does not do so in a manner that is substantially similar to TDC.

“(5) paired or juxtaposed images, either photographs, prints, or drawings, both recent and historical, that visually
compare specific treatments of slaves with specific treatments of animals.” (Engell Rpt. at { 1.)

As noted previously, there is no consistency in how TDC presents its illustrations. Some have a comparison illustration
on the same page: one depicting slavery and the other relating to animals. ( See e.g., TDC at 42, 53, 81, 84.) Some such
comparative illustrations are on pages that face each other. ( See e.g., id. at 36-37, 54-55, 66-67, 68-69, 88-89, 92-93,
96-97, 100-01.) Other illustrations are presented in a stand-alone manner with no comparative illustration offered. ( See

e.g., id. at 39, 41, 51, 56, 63, 74.) It is commonplace for a work comparing or contrasting seemingly disparate events or
circumstances to contain side-by-side illustrations. For example, it would be strange for an illustrated work comparing World
War | artillery with World War II artillery to refrain from displaying comparative images on the same or facing pages.

ALP uses illustrations in many and different ways. As noted, some pages display a side-by-side comparison of images
( see e.g. ALP at 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40) followed by a corresponding page on which only one of the two images is displayed.
(Id. at 26, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47, 48.) Some of the images feature horrific bloody scenes in color.

[768 F.Supp.2d 683]

( Id. at 31-33.) Images of the tools of human and animal oppression (chicken shackles, prisoner restraints, castrator,
scissors and razors, branding irons) are displayed on interactive WebPages. ( /d. at 64-74.) There is nothing original or
distinctive about the use of illustrations in either TDC or the ALP. As noted, side-by-side comparisons of things asserted to
be similar are commonplace.

Of course, Knitwaves teaches that unprotected elements, when combined, may become an original and protectable
feature of a work. “[T]he original way in which the author has ‘selected, coordinated, and arranged’ the elements of his or
her work’ is protectable. 71 F.3d at 1004 (quoting Feist_499 U. S. Reports 358, 111 S.Ct. 1282 ). The “total concept and
feel” of the two works must be similar. /d. at 1003-04. Insofar as unprotected elements in TDC (that are found or said to be
found in ALP) are combined, there is no resulting originality.

For example, few in Western literature have been the subject of more written works than Abraham Lincoln, who,
incidentally, is quoted in TDC. ( TDC at 109.) Biographies of Lincoln can be expected to contain common combinations of
unprotected elements, such as (1) divisions of the periods of Lincoln's life (work on the river, work as lawyer, his presidential
candidacy, frustration over the conduct of the war, the Emancipation Proclamation, the assassination), (2) usage of quotes
by Lincoln or about Lincoln by a relatively small assemblage of contemporaries, (3) comparisons and contrasts to other
famous personages, such as George Washington, William Seward or Stephen A. Douglas, (4) a selection of photographs,
many taken by Matthew Brady, and (5) a speculative discourse explaining why the Reconstruction era would have been
different if Lincoln had lived, usually suggesting that it would have been more harmonious and that greater social progress
would have been made. Yet, the combination of these unoriginal elements would not ordinarily become original and
protectable. 2

In the arena of public debate, it is common to compare a contemporary event, political movement or public figure to a
historical antecedent. The fact of the comparison, coupled with the use of side-by-side images, quotations and divisions into
subtopics, may often be so commonplace and unoriginal that even when all these elements are combined, they do not form
an original, protectable work. This is such an instance.

“Originality remains the sine qua non of copyright; accordingly, copyright protection may extend only to those
components of a work that are original to the author.” Feist, 499 U. S. Reports 348 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 . Viewing the facts ina
light most favorable to the plaintiff, no reasonable jury, properly charged on the law, could find that PETA engaged in
unauthorized copying of original components of IDEA'S copyrighted work, or an unlawful copying of a combination of

unprotected elements. The “total concept and feel” of TDC and ALP are, for reasons explained, different.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons outlined above, defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
SO ORDERED.

Notes:

4.The first edition was published in 1988; a second edition was published in 1989 and a revised and expanded edition
was published in 1996. The parties have tendered the complete 1996 edition on this motion. The TDC is found as Exhibit 6


--- Page 7 ---
to the Zissu Declaration. For ease, it will be referred to as “ TDC at ——.”

2.The author draws a comparison between animal experimentation and the 20th century Tuskegee Syphilis Study,

which examined the effects of untreated syphilis on a population consisting largely of poor African Americans. ( TDC at 69-
70.)

3.The ALPis found as Exhibit 40 to the Langer Declaration with internal pagination of “PETA 000001” et seq. For ease,
it will be referred to as “ ALP at ——.”

4|DEA disputes PETA's claim that ALPis an outgrowth of PETA's earlier work. This dispute is not material to the
disposition of this motion.

5IDEA asserts that it owns the copyright to the Foreword, but PETA and Ms. Walker dispute this contention. This
dispute is not material to the disposition of the pending motion because, for the purposes of the infringement analysis, the
Court assumes the truth of the facts tendered by the non-movant that IDEA owns the copyright to the Foreword.

&This Court will consider the Walker quote in its subsequent infringement analysis in examining whether there has
been copying of an original selection of unprotected elements, including in the examination of the overall look and feel of
the works.

2Of course, the author's particularized expression of ideas about Lincoln would be protectable and one Lincoln book
could in other respects copy the “total concept and feel” of another.

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
McMAHON, District Judge:

Plaintiff Flo & Eddie, Inc. (“Flo and Eddie”) brings this putative class action suit against Defendant Sirius XM Radio, Inc.
(‘Sirius’). The complaint alleges that Sirius committed common law copyright infringement and engaged in unfair competition
by publicly performing sound recordings owned by Flo and Eddie, and by reproducing those recordings in aid of its
performances. Before the Court is Docket # 46, Sirius's motion for summary judgment. For the reasons stated below, the
motion is DENIED.

Furthermore, it appears to the Court that there are no disputed issues of material fact as to liability. Sirius is therefore
ORDERED to show cause by December 5, 2014, why summary judgment should not be entered in favor of Flo and Eddie as
to liability only. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f)(1).

BACKGROUND
|. Factual Background
A. The Parties

Flo and Eddie is a California corporation, wholly owned by its principals, Mark Volman (“Volman”) and Howard Kaylan
(‘Kaylan’). (Sirius 56.1 Statement J 1-2; Volman Decl. 4 1.) Volman and Kaylan are two of the original members of The
Turtles (“the Turtles”), a 1960s rock group whose hits included “Happy Together” and a cover of Bob Dylan's “It Ain't Me
Babe.” (Sirius 56.1 Statement ¥ 16; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement {{ 2-3.)

Master recordings of the Turtles' performances-all of which were made prior to February 15, 1972 were originally held by
White Whale Records. (Sirius 56.1 Statement 9 1, 17; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement

[62 F.Supp.3d 331]

49 3, 5; Volman Decl. 4 2.) White Whale transferred those recordings to the Turtles' members as part of a legal settlement.
(Sirius 56.1 Statement 18; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement § 5.) Volman and Kaylan purchased the remaining Turtles’
members' interests in the recordings, and ultimately transferred all ownership interests in the recordings to Flo and Eddie.
(Sirius 56.1 Statement 4 19-20; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement {J 6-7.)

Sirius is a Delaware corporation engaged in the satellite radio business. (Sirius 56.1 Statement § 3.) Sirius provides digital
audio content to its subscribers, who pay a periodic fee. (Geller Decl., Ex. 6.) Subscribers can receive audio content in
several ways. Many subscribers—a majority according to Sirius—use special digital radios installed in their vehicles. (Sirius
56.1 Statement 15; Smith Decl. { 4.) Other subscribers stream the same programming over the internet to a computer or
mobile device. (Sirius 56.1 Statement 4 6; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement ¥ 14; Smith Decl. § 6; see Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr.
at 194:22-25.) Some users receive Sirius's music programming through Dish Network set-top boxes. (Sirius 56.1 Statement
46; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement § 3; Smith Decl. 4 6; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 224:22-226:5.) Businesses can also
receive music broadcasts to play in their retail establishments through Sirius's “Business Establishment Service.” (Sirius
56.1 Statement ¥ 6; Smith Decl. 4 6.)

Sirius offers a diverse set of programming including talk radio, live sports coverage, and music. (Sirius 56.1 Statement 4.)
Music programming is featured on dozens of Sirius channels. (Geller Decl., Ex. 7.) Many of those channels—for example


--- Page 2 ---
“60s on 6” or “70s on 7”—broadcast pre—1972 sound recordings. (Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement § 13.) Some of those
channels have broadcast Turtles sound recordings. ( See, e.g., Sirius 56.1 Statement 4 21-22; Smith Decl. 4 12-13.)
Both Sirius subscribers and users those who receive Sirius content through Dish Network set-top boxes can listen to
programming that features pre—1972 sound recordings. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 226:6-18.)

Sirius acknowledges that it “perform[s]” sound recordings, including pre-1972 sound recordings, by broadcasting them over
its satellite radio network and streaming them over the internet. (Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 96:21-97:15.) The pre-1972
sound recordings Sirius has performed include Turtles recordings. (Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 104:8-105:9.) Sirius does not
currently know how many pre—1972 recordings it has performed, or how many times it has performed Turtles recordings.
(Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 97:16-25, 105:1 1-22.)

B. Sirius's Operations

To understand Flo and Eddie's claims, one has to understand a bit about the technical aspects of Sirius's operations. Sirius
stores its permanent digital music library on three databases, named “Prophet,” “Dalet 5.1,” and “Dalet Plus.” (Sirius 56.1
Statement 9 24-26; Smith Decl. 4 17; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 154:2-8.) The Prophet database is located in New York
City, and the two Dalet databases are located in Washington, D.C. (Sirius 56.1 Statement 9 25-26; Smith Decl. {§ 18-19.)
Sirius maintains onsite backup copies of each database, as well as off-site disaster recovery copies of the Prophet database
in New Jersey, and of the Dalet databases in Georgia. (Sirius 56.1 Statement ¥ § 25-26; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement 4
18; Smith Decl. {{ 18-19; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 154:11-155:23, 156:15-157:7.)

The content of the three databases overlaps imperfectly. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr.
[62 F.Supp.3d 332]

at 156:7—14.) Some recordings may be stored on all three databases. Other recordings might be stored only on Prophet,
while others may be stored only on the Dalet databases. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 75:12-76:13.) Each database stores
copies of pre—1972 recordings. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 159:24-160:9; Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 38:6-40:6.) At least
18,000 such copies are stored on the Prophet database, and at least 24,000 are stored on each of the Dalet databases. (Flo
and Eddie 56.1 Statement 4 17; Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 40:8-42:15, 43:15-44:19; see Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 61:19—
62:11.) The Prophet database in New York contains 14 Turtles recordings, while the Dalet databases in Washington, D.C.,
contain 71 such recordings. (Sirius 56.1 Statement 9 29-30; see Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement § 16; Smith Decl. 4 23-
24.) The backup and disaster recovery databases, like the Dalet and Prophet databases also contain pre—1972 recordings.
(Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 73:9-24.)

In addition to its three main databases, Sirius stores subsets of its music library on smaller databases at off-site locations.
(Sirius 56.1 Statement 33; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement § 18; Smith Decl. { 27.) Specifically, Sirius maintains recordings
from the Prophet database on smaller databases in Nashville, Orlando, and Boston. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 158:17-21,
159:6-9.) Recordings from the Dalet databases reside on databases in Cleveland, Austin, and Los Angeles. (Sirius 56.1
Statement 4 33; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 158:22-159:5.) These smaller databases are used to produce on-location shows
tailored to a particular musical style or on-air talent. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 158:17—159:9, 163:4-21.) Some of these
databases contain pre—1972 recordings, and the Cleveland database contains at least one Turtles recording. (Sirius 56.1
Statement 4 33; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 160:9-161:25, 162:25-163:3, 164:12-23; Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 51:11-54:4.)

Sirius has also copied some recordings to a database that it transferred to Omnifone, a UK-based firm that operates the My
SXM service, described below. (Sirius 56.1 Statement § 35; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement § 29; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at
33:25-34:16, 165:4-11; Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 107:15-21.) Although the parties agree that Omnifone continues to
possess those copies, Sirius claims that Omnifone can use them only for a very limited purpose: to provide the customized
My SXM service. (Sirius 56.1 Statement § 35; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 35:9-25.) The database transferred to Omnifone
contains pre—1972 recordings, including Turtles recordings. (Sirius 56.1 Statement 35; Smith Decl. 4§ 27, 29; Smith
2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 165:7-15; Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 54:22-55:14.)

Several hours before Sirius plays a sound recording on one of its programs, it creates an additional copy of the recording on
its “play-out server.” (Sirius 56.1 Statement 4 37; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement 20; Smith Decl. § 31; Smith 2/11/14 Dep.
Tr. at 19:5-16.) Content is broadcast directly from the play-out server; the copy ensures a smooth broadcast even if there is
a network disruption. (Sirius 56.1 Statement 37; Smith Decl. 4 31; see Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 114:15-116:16.) The copy
on the play-out server is deleted once a recording is broadcast. (Sirius 56.1 Statement 4 37; Smith Decl. 4 31.) Each time a
recording is performed, a new copy is created on the play-out server. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 117:9-11; Smith 3/12/14
Dep. Tr. at 89:2—7.) Because Sirius has performed pre—1972 recordings, including Turtles recordings, it has necessarily
copied those recordings to its play-out server-many times, in fact. (Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 88:2—

[62 F.Supp.3d 333]

20, 91:5-16.) But Sirius does not know how many copies of those recordings have been made on its play out server (Smith
3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 89:8-91:4.)

To deliver content through its streaming service, Sirius employs a third party, Akami. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 176:5—-11;
Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 108:3-21.) Sirius sends a signal of its programming to Akami; Akami in turn makes several
temporary copies of the recordings that Sirius sends it in order to facilitate its content distribution operation. (Smith 2/11/14
Dep. Tr. at 177:21-178:11.) Pre-1972 recordings are included in the programming that Sirius broadcasts and Akami copies.


--- Page 3 ---
(Smith 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 46:17-20.)

Sirius makes additional complete of recordings it has broadcast for its “Start Now” service. 1( See Sirius 56.1 Statement
39; Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement ff 15, 22, 29; Geller Decl., Ex. 5; Smith Decl. 4 33.) Start Now is a time-shifting feature. It
allows users to start from the beginning (up to five hours earlier) a program that Sirius is currently broadcasting. (Sirius 56.1
Statement 4 39; Smith Decl. § 33; Smith Decl. § 33.) To provide this service, Sirius keeps a running cache of its broadcasts.
(Sirius 56.1 Statement § 39; Smith Decl. { 33.) The cache is continually updating to store the most recent five hours-earlier
data is overwritten on a first-in-first-out basis. (Sirius 56.1 Statement § 39; Smith Decl. 4 33.) Sirius acknowledges that
copies of pre—1972 recordings have been cached for the Start Now feature. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 214:9-12.)

Separately from the Start Now feature, Sirius also authorizes Quick Play, a third party, to maintain a five hour cache of Sirius
programming. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 179:5-17, 193:16—19.) Quick Play's role, performed in conjunction with Akami, is to
deliver Sirius content to mobile devices. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 179:23—-180:4.) As with the Start Now cache, Quick Play
has included pre—1972 recordings in its five-hour cache. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 214:9-19.)

In aid of broadcasting, Sirius also makes partial copies of some recordings, known as “tips-and-tails” copies. (Sirius 56.1
Statement { 36; Flo and Edie 56.1 Statement § 19; Smith Decl. § 30; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 18:4-25.) These copies
contain the final few seconds of one recording and the first few seconds of the recording set to play after it. (Sirius 56.1
Statement 36; Smith Decl. § 30; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 52:20-53:25.) Hosts of Sirius programs use the tips-and-tails
copies to properly time voice-overs in which they will, for example, announce the titles of the recording that just played and
the one about to play. (Sirius 56.1 Statement ¥ 36; Smith Decl. § 30; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 18:4-25.) A host will pre-
record voice-overs against the background of the tips-and-tails recording to ensure that a voice-over does not bleed over too
far into the body of a recording. After the voice-over is recorded, the tips-and-tails copy is deleted. (Sirius 56.1 Statement 4
36; Smith Decl. § 30; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 55:5-56:10.) (There appears to be one exception. The smaller regional
“Margaritaville” database retains permanent copies of tips-and-tails recordings. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 83:2-84:6.))
Partial copies of pre—1972 recordings, including Turtles recordings, have been made for tips-and-tails purposes. (Smith
2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 56:11-18; Smith 3/12/14 Dep.

[62 F.Supp.3d 334]

Tr. at 80:11-81:4, 82:14-20, 84:8-21.) But Sirius does not know exactly how many such copies have been made. (Smith
3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 81:6-82:13.)

The most contentious factual dispute between the parties concerns buffering, which Flo and Eddie describes as “progressive
downloading.” (Flo and Eddie 56.1 Statement {{ 30-31; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 203:18-204:10.) Buffering, in general,
refers to storing a small segment of audio or video content in computer memory to ensure smooth playback. Sirius's content
is buffered at several points. Sirius buffers for four seconds at the “earth station,” where content is uplinked to a satellite.
(Sirius 56.1 Statement ¥ 38; Smith Decl. § 32; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 119:12-120:2.) The four second buffer allows Sirius
to send two separate signals to its satellites. A user's radio can then substitute one transmission for another if a connection
is momentarily blocked, so that playback will not be interrupted. (Sirius 56.1 Statement § 38; Smith Decl. § 32.) The
satellites then send back the two signals, where they are received by a “terrestrial repeater.” (Sirius 56.1 Statement { 38;
Smith Decl. ¥ 32; Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 93:12-15.) The terrestrial repeaters buffer the first signal received until they
receive the second signal, generally on the order of a few milliseconds later. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 93:16—94:3, 135:18-
136:25.) Finally, Sirius digital radios store signals they receive in memory, creating a four-second buffer at the point where
subscribers listen to content. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 96:3-97:7, 111:15-112:10; see Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 137:14-18
(noting that there are two distinct four-second buffers).)

Some individual radio receivers create a buffer of up to 30 minutes on a channel to which a subscriber is listening. (Sirius
56.1 Statement ¥ 44; Smith Decl. 35.) That buffer allows users to “replay” a few minutes of a show they miss. (Sirius 56.1
Statement 4 44; Smith Decl. § 35.) The replay buffer is overwritten on a rolling first-in, first-out basis and is erased if a user
changes the channel or turns off the radio. (Sirius 56.1 Statement § 44; Smith Decl. { 35.) Finally, mobile phones or other
internet-connected devices also create a buffer when they stream Sirius's content. (Sirius 56.1 Statement 4 43; Smith Decl.
434.) Because buffers are created any time Sirius broadcasts a recording, Sirius has of course created buffers of pre-1972
recordings. (Smith 2/11/14 Dep. Tr. at 138:7-13.)

Flo and Eddie emphasizes that every second of a buffered recording will, at some point, be cached in the buffer, even if no
complete copy is ever created. Sirius stresses that buffers are constantly adding new data and removing old data. At any
one time, a buffer contains at most a few seconds of content, which may include portions of more than one recording.

The long and short of this is—Sirius makes multiple copies, temporary, permanent, whole or partial, during its broadcast
process; and it performs the copies it makes. Furthermore, as to pre—1972 sound recordings, it does so without obtaining
licenses or paying royalties. Sirius has not obtained a license to copy most of the pre—1972 recordings stored in its various
databases. (Frear 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 77:20—79:25.) Nor has Sirius obtained licenses to perform most of those recordings
over the internet, (Frear 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 80:2-21), or to authorize third parties Omnifone or Akami to stream its
programming. (Frear 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 90:11—91:5.) Sirius has not paid royalties to copy or perform most of its pre-1972
recordings. (Frear 3/12/14 Dep. Tr. at 69:10—16.)

For all the copying it does do, it's worth noting what Sirius does not do. Sirius

[62 F.Supp.3d 335]


--- Page 4 ---
does not currently allow users to download and store complete copies of any recordings. (Sirius 56.1 Statement J 24, 40,
41, 43; Smith Decl. 4 14.) In this way, Sirius differs from file-sharing services such as Napster and Limewire. (Sirius 56.1
Statement 4 41; Smith Decl. ¥ 14.)

Nor does Sirius allow users to listen to a particular recording whenever they choose to do so. In this way, Sirius differs from
some internet radio services like Spotify. (Sirius 56.1 Statement § 41; Smith Decl. J 14.) Users can customize the
programming they receive to a limited extent using the “My SXM” feature. (Sirius 56.1 Statement § 35; Flo and Eddie 56.1
Statement q 15; Geller Decl., Ex. 8; Smith Decl. 4 28.) For example, a user could choose to emphasize folk music and
deemphasize rock music on a 70s channel. But that user could not choose to listen only to Bob Dylan, much less a
particular Bob Dylan recording, while excluding anything by Led Zeppelin. ( See Sirius 56.1 Statement 4 41; Smith Decl.
14, 28.)

Il. Procedural Background

Flo and Eddie filed its initial complaint on August 16, 2013. (Docket # 1.) In response to a motion to dismiss filed by Sirius,
Flo and Eddie filed an amended complaint on November 13, 2013. (Docket # 32.)

Flo and Eddie has filed companion suits in California and Florida. ( See Flo & Eddie, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc.,No. 13—
cv—23182 (S.D.Fla.); Flo & Eddie, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc., No. 13—cv—05693 (C.D.Cal.)). In each case, Flo and Eddie
has asserted state-law claims under the law of the state in which the suit was filed. The district court in the California suit
granted Flo and Eddie's motion for summary judgment as to liability. The district court in the Florida suit has not yet issued a
decision on a pending motion by Flo and Eddie for summary judgment as to liability.

To understand why Flo and Eddie seeks relief under state law, one has to know a bit about federal copyright law. Since
1831, federal law has protected copyrights in musical compositions. See 17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(2) ; Act of Feb. 3, 1831, ch. 16,
§ 1, 4 Stat. 436. “The creator of a musical composition has long had a right of exclusive public performance of that musical
piece.” Bonneville Int'l Corp. v. Peters, 347 F.3d 485 , 487 (3d Cir.2003). Thus, when radio stations publicly perform—that is,
broadcast—copyrighted musical compositions, they pay royalties to the holder of the copyright in the song—generally the
composer or his heirs—for the privilege of doing so. Woods v. Bourne Co., 60 F.3d 978 , 983-84 (2d Cir.1995). Those
royalties are typically collected and distributed by professional clearinghouses, such as the American Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”). /d.; see Broad. Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc.,441 U.S. 1 , 4-5, 99 S.Ct. 1551
, 60 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979) (describing ASCAP).

A copyright in a musical composition is notsame as a copyright in a sound recording of a performance of that composition.
And this lawsuit not about musical compositions. (Pl. Opp. Mem. at 10 n. 6.) As far as the Court is aware, Sirius pays
royalties to the holder of the copyright for the right to perform the Turtles' musical compositions.

This suit is about copyright in sound recordings, which is a different animal. A sound recording is a medium in or on which a

particular performance of a musical composition (song) is fixed for posterity and for playback. See 17 U.S.C. § 101. In
essence, a copyright in a sound

[62 F.Supp.3d 336]

recording is a copyright in the performance—not in the work being performed.

Congress only made sound recordings eligible for federal statutory copyright protection in 1971. See Sound Recordings Act,
Pub.L. No. 92-140, 85 Stat. 391 (1971). Furthermore, that protection was limited in two important ways.

First, Congress did not originally provide sound recording copyright holders with an exclusive right to publicly perform their
works. Bonneville Int'l Corp., 347 F.3d at 487 . Thus, the owners of copyrights in sound recordings, unlike copyright holders
in musical compositions were not entitled to compensation under federal law when radio stations broadcast their recordings
between 1972 and 1995. /d. In 1995, Congress added a limited public performance right for sound recordings, giving holders
of sound recording copyrights the “exclusive right[ ] ... to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio
transmission.” 17 U.S.C. § 106. Federal copyright law still provides no exclusive right to public performance of sound
recordings by any other means. See Arista Records, LLC v. Launch Media, Inc.. 578 F.3d 148 , 153-54 (2d Cir.2009).

The second important limitation of the 1971 Act was that it operated prospectively. Recordings “fixed” (recorded) prior to

February 15, 1972 were not, and still are not, eligible for federal copyright protection. See 17 U.S.C. § 301(c). The Turtles
recordings were all fixed before February 15, 1972. Therefore, none is eligible for federal copyright protection.

Instead of adopting a federal copyright scheme for pre—1972 sound recordings, Congress left the issue to the states. For
works protected by federal law, Congress broadly preempted any “equivalent right in any such work under the common law
or statutes of any State.” /d. § 301(a). For sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, however, Congress expressly
did “not ... annul [] or limit[ ]” “any rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any State.” /d. § 301(c).

Flo and Eddie argues that New York provides pre—1972 sound recording owners with rights and remedies under its common
law. Flo and Eddie further argues that New York's common law copyright protection, which extends to pre-1972 sound
recordings, prohibits both reproducing and publicly performing those recordings. It also argues the law of unfair competition


--- Page 5 ---
provides similar protection.

Sirius has moved for summary judgment. (Docket # 46.) It argues that: (1) New York common law copyrights in pre—1972
sound recordings do not afford an exclusive right of public performance; (2) the copies Sirius made of Turtles recordings are
protected by fair use; (3) sustaining Flo and Eddie's claims would violate the Dormant Commerce Clause; and (4) Flo and
Eddie's entire action is barred by the doctrine of laches.

DISCUSSION
|. Standard

A party is entitled to summary judgment when there is “no genuine issue as to any material fact” and the undisputed facts
warrant judgment for the moving party as a matter of law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby. Inc.. 477 U.S. 242 , 247-48, 106 S.Ct.
2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) ; see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a), (c). On a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the
record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor. Matsushita Elec.
Indus. Co. Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp.. 475 U.S. 574 , 587,106 S.Ct. 1348 , 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) .

[62 F.Supp.3d 337]

The moving party has the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a disputed issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett. 477 U.S. 317 , 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . Once such a showing has been made, the nonmoving
party must present “specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521 , 529, 126
S.Ct. 2572 , 165 L.Ed.2d 697 (2006) . The party opposing summary judgment “may not rely on conclusory allegations or
unsubstantiated speculation.” Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105 , 114 (2d Cir.1998). Moreover, not every disputed factual
issue is material in light of the substantive law that governs the case. “Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome
of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude summary judgment.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248 , 106 S.Ct. 2505 .

To withstand a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party “must do more than simply show that there is some
metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586 , 106 S.Ct. 1348 . Instead, sufficient evidence must
exist upon which a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. “Summary judgment is designed ... to
flush out those cases that are predestined to result in directed verdict.” Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110 F.3d 898 , 907
(2d Cir.1997).

Il. Sirius Cannot Invoke the Defense of Laches

Sirius argues that Flo and Eddie's entire suit is barred by the defense of laches. But it is not.

“The defense of laches is unavailable in [an] action at law commenced within the period of limitations.” Cadlerock, L.L.C. v.
Renner, 72 A.D.3d 454 , 898 N.Y.S.2d 127 , 128 (2010) ;see Onanuga v. Pfizer, Inc., 369 F.Supp.2d 491 , 499
(S.D.N.Y.2005) ; Coit v. Campbell, 82 N.Y. 509 , 512-13 (1880). Flo and Eddie has brought an action at law for damages.
Flo and Eddie's unfair competition claim—grounded in misappropriation—is subject to a three-year statute of limitations.
Sporn v. MCA Records, Inc., 88 A.D.2d 857 , 451 N.Y.S.2d 750 , 751 (1982) aff'd, 58 N.Y.2d 482 , 462 N.Y.S.2d 413 , 448
N.E.2d 1324 (1983) . The claim for common law copyright infringement is also an action at lawArnstein v. Porter, 154 F.2d
464 , 468 (2d Cir.1946) ; Bercovici v. Chaplin, 7 F.R.D. 61, 62 (S.D.N.Y.1946), subject to a six year statute of limitations.
Capitol Records, LLC v. Harrison Greenwich, LLC, 44 Misc.3d 428 , 986 N.Y.S.2d 837 , 838 (Sup.Ct.2014). Flo and Eddie
seeks damages on both claims, and Sirius does not argue that they are brought outside the applicable statutes of limitations.
Thus, those claims are not barred by laches.

Nor does laches bar Flo and Eddie's prayer for an injunction. That request “for an equitable remedy” is made “in aid of or to
enforce a legal right.” Bohemian Brethren Presbyterian Church v. Greek Archdiocesan Cathedral of Holy Trinity. 94 Misc.2d
841 , 405 N.Y.S.2d 926 , 929 (Sup.Ct.1978) aff'd, 70 A.D.2d 538 , 416 N.Y.S.2d 751 (1979) (citing Galway v. Metro.

Elevated Ry. Co., 128 N.Y. 132 , 28 N.E. 479 (1891) ). In that situation, the defense of laches is similarly unavailable. The
statute of limitation controls both the legal action for damages and the equitable remedy. /d.; see Trust for Certificate Holders
of Merrill Lynch Mortg. Passthrough Certificates Series 1999-C1 v. Love Funding Corp., No. 04 Civ. 9890, 2005 WL
2582177, at *8 & n. 87 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2005).

Ill. Flo and Ed die Holds the Valid Common Law Copyright in the Turtles' Sound Recordings
As explained above, federal law provides copyright protection for sound recordings
[62 F.Supp.3d 338]

fixed on or after February 15, 1972. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 102(a)(7), 301(c). As to those sound recordings, Congress broadly
preempted equivalent state-law protections. /d. § 301(a). Federal law does not, however, provide copyright protection for
sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972. Furthermore, Congress expressly declined to preempt whatever common
law copyright protection was provided to those recordings by state law until February 15, 2067. /d. § 301(c).


--- Page 6 ---
New York has elected to “fill th[e] void” Congress left, by continuing to enforce its preexisting body of copyright common law
for pre-1972 sound recordings. Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of Am., Inc. (Naxos), 4 N.Y.3d 540 , 559-60, 565, 797
N.Y.S.2d 352 , 830 N.E.2d 250 (2005) ; see Capitol Records v. Mercury Records Corp., 221 F.2d 657 , 662-63 (2d Cir.1955)
Firma Melodiya v. ZYX Music GmbH, 882 F.Supp. 1306 , 1316 (S.D.N.Y.1995). Under that law, artists can acquire a
common law copyright in “any original material product of intellectual labor” A.J. Sandy, Inc. v. Junior City, Inc., 17 A.D.2d
407 , 234 N.Y.S.2d 508 , 510 (1962) —including sound recordings—by expending “time, effort, money, and great skill” in its
creation. 104 N.Y. Jur.2d Trade Regulation § 262 ; see RCA Mfg. Co. v. Whiteman, 114 F.2d 86 , 88 (2d Cir.1940). The term
“any original material product of intellectual labor” includes sound recordings. See, e.g., Capitol Records, Inc. v. Greatest
Records, Inc.. 43 Misc.2d 878 , 252 N.Y.S.2d 553 , 554-55 (Sup.Ct.1964) ; Metro. Opera Ass'n, Inc. v. Wagner-Nichols
Recorder Corp., 199 Misc. 786 , 101 N.Y.S.2d 483 , 492-93 (Sup.Ct.1950) aff'd, 279 A.D. 632 , 107 N.Y.S.2d 795 (1951) .

The Turtles originally acquired a common law copyright in their sound recordings by expending time, effort, money and skill
to create them. That copyright was then transferred to White Whale, and eventually to Flo and Eddie, which now owns the
sound recordings. Sirius does not contest Flo and Eddie's claim to possess a common law copyright in the Turtles
recordings (though it insinuates that some of the underlying ownership transfers are undocumented). Rather, Sirius
contends that Flo and Eddie's rights as holder of the copyright in the sound recordings does not give them the exclusive
right to publicly perform those works.

IV. Flo and Eddie's Common Law Copyright Provides Exclusive Rights to Reproduce and Publicly Perform Turtles
Recordings

Flo and Eddie alleges that Sirius has infringed its common law copyright by (1) reproducing (making copies of) the master
recordings, and (2) performing those recordings (or the illicit copies of them) publicly.

New York unquestionably provides holders of common law copyrights in sound recordings with an exclusive right to
reproduce those recordings. See Capito! Records, _221 F.2d at 663 ; Naxos, 4 N.Y.3d at 559 —60, 563-64, 797 N.Y.S.2d 352
, 830 N.E.2d 250 . Sirius does not challenge that proposition, although it argues that its reproductions of Turtles sound
recordings constitute fair use. That issue will be discussed below.

Whether New York provides holders of common law copyrights in sound recordings with an exclusive right to publicly
perform those recordings presents a much thornier question—one of first impression, and one that has profound economic
consequences for the recording industry and both the analog and digital broadcast industries. My first task is to predict how |
believe the New York Court of Appeals would rule on this question,

[62 F.Supp.3d 339]

which no appellate court in New York has yet confronted. City of Johnstown, N.Y. v. Bankers Standard Ins. Co., 877 F.2d
1146 , 1153 (2d Cir.1989).2

| conclude that the New York Court of Appeals would recognize the exclusive right to public performance of a sound
recording as one of the rights appurtenant to common law copyright in such a recording.

“In general, the rights under common law copyright ... are at least co-extensive with the rights commanded under the
Copyright Act.” 2 Melville B. Nimmer and David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 8[C][2] (Matthew Bender, Rev. Ed.). But
when New York first recognized common law copyrights in sound recordings—over 50 years ago—Congress had not yet
authorized any federal copyright protection for sound recordings. Naxos, 4 N.Y.3d at 560 , 797 N.Y.S.2d 352 , 830 N.E.2d
250 .

Thus, the protections New York common law offers to holders of copyrights in sound recordings cannot be determined by
reference to comparable federal protection. Instead, | must look to the background principles and history of New York
copyright common law. See id. at 546, 797 N.Y.S.2d 352 , 830 N.E.2d 250 (“[W]hen examining copyright law, a page of
history is worth a volume of logic.” (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).

The common law typically “protects against unauthorized reproduction of copies or phonorecords, unauthorized distribution
by publishing or vending, and unauthorized performances.” 2 Nimmer on Copyright § 8[C][2] (internal citations omitted)
(emphasis added); see Letter Edged in Black Press. Inc. v. Pub. Bldg. Comm'n of Chicago, 320 F.Supp. 1303 , 1308
(N.D.III.1970) ; cf. Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P.,_756 F.3d 73 , 81 (2d Cir.2014) (describing the bundle).
New York courts have long afforded public performance rights to holders of common law copyrights in works such as plays,
Palmer v. De Witt, 47 N.Y. 532 , 535-36, 540-41 (1872) : Roberts v. Petrova, 126 Misc. 86 , 213 N.Y.S. 434 , 434-37
(Sup.Ct.1925) ; French v. Maguire, 55 How. Pr. 471, 472-73, 479-80, 1878 WL 11310 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1878) and films,
Brandon Films, Inc. v. Arjay Enter., Inc., 33 Misc.2d 794 , 230 N.Y.S.2d 56 , 57-58 (Sup.Ct.1962). The Second Circuit
concluded over three decades ago that New York would recognize a public performance right in compilations of film clips.
Roy Exp. Co. v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 672 F.2d 1095 , 1097-99, 1101-04 (2d Cir.1982) (applying New York law).

Nonetheless, Sirius advances a number of arguments for why New York common law copyright in sound recordings does
not include any public performance right.


--- Page 7 ---
Sirius principally argues that no such right exists because New York case law contains no discussion of public performance
rights in sound recordings. But the exact same argument could have been made (and undoubtedly was made, and rejected)
in Naxos —a case decided only in 2005, more than a century after sound recordings were invented. The very fact that Naxos
was decided in favor of the

[62 F.Supp.3d 340]

common law copyright holder, after more than a century of judicial silence, means that this court can infer nothing—certainly
not that the common law copyright in sound recordings does not encompass all of the rights traditionally accorded to
copyright holders in other works, including the right of public performance—from the fact that this is the first case to raise the
issue.

Of course, the conspicuous lack of any jurisprudential history confirms that not paying royalties for public performances of
sound recordings was an accepted fact of life in the broadcasting industry for the last century. So does certain testimony
cited by Sirius from record industry executives, artists and others, who argued vociferously before Congress that it was unfair
or them to operate in an environment in which they were paid nothing when their sound recordings were publicly performed.
See, e.g., Digital Performance Rights: Hearing Before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Courts and
Intellectual Property on H.R. 1506, 104th Cong. (1995) (statement of Edward O. Fritts, President & CEO, Nat'l Ass'n of
Broadcasters), 1995 WL 371107 ; H. Comm. On Patents, 74th Cong., Hearings on Revision of Copyright Laws 622
(Comm.Print.1936) (statement of H.A. Huebner, representing Brunswick Record Corp. and Columbia Phonograph Co.); see
also Sirius Summary Judgment Mem. at 9-12. That they were paid no royalties was a matter of statutory exemption under
ederal law; that they demanded no royalties under the common law when their product as ineligible for federal copyright
protection is, in many ways, inexplicable.

But acquiescence by participants in the recording industry in a status quo where recording artists and producers were not
paid royalties while songwriters were does not show that they lacked an enforceable right under the common law—only that
hey failed to act on it. The United States Copyright Office, in its most recent commentary on this subject, concluded, “While,
as a factual matter, a state may not have affirmatively acknowledged a public performance right in pre—1972 recordings as
of the Office's 2011 report, the language in the report should not be read to suggest that a state could not properly interpret
its law to recognize such a right.” Music Licensing Study: Second Request for Comments, 79 Fed.Reg. 42,833 -01, 42,834
n. 3 (July 23, 2014).

The United States Supreme Court admonished recently against reading too much into a lack of precedent for a point,
stating (in another context), “It should be unsurprising that such a significant matter has been for so long judicially
unresolved.” D.C. v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 , 625, 128 S.Ct. 2783 , 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008) . The Supreme Court, for example,
failed to grapple with many fundamental constitutional questions for the first 150 years of the Constitution's existence. /d. at
625-26, 128 S.Ct. 2783 . | thus do not read too much into the fact that New York courts have never squarely addressed a
particular feature of state copyright law in the context of sound recordings.

In fact, there is precedent for this kind of judicial silence in the copyright arena. Prior to 1976, choreography was deemed
ineligible for any sort of copyright protection, under federal or common law. Courts declined to offer copyright protection to
dance on the theory that choreographic works did not “tell” a story, and thus could not be considered copyright-eligible
“dramas.” See, e.g., Seltzer v. Sunbrock, 22 F.Supp. 621 , 628-29 (S.D.Cal.1938) ; Fuller v. Bemis, 50 F. 926, 929
(S.D.N.Y.1892). That changed with the 1976 amendments to the Copyright Act, which explicitly recognized “choreographic
works” as copyright-eligible. See Copyright

[62 F.Supp.3d 341]

Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541, 2544-45. Since then, an entire body of law has evolved concerning dance
copyright—not all at once, or all as soon as the 1976 Act became effective, but over the ensuing decades.

So it is not surprising that sound recordings, like choreographic works, received little attention from courts before they
became eligible for statutory copyright. It is likely that the issue was just not on anyone's radar screen until Congress
granted a public performance right in more recent sound recordings.

An arguably stronger argument can be made that years of judicial silence implies exactly the opposite of what Sirius
contends—not that common law copyright in sound recordings carries no right of public performance, but rather that
common law copyright in sound recordings comes with the entire bundle of rights that holders of copyright in other works
enjoy. No New York case recognizing a common law copyright in sound recordings has so much as suggested that right was
in some way circumscribed, or that the bundle of rights appurtenant to that copyright was less than the bundle of rights
accorded to plays and musical compositions. The expansive nature of New York's common law protection for artistic works
that do not enjoy federal statutory copyright protection was announced over fifty years ago, in Metropolitan Opera
Association v. Wagner—-Nichols Recorder Corp., supra —a case protecting property rights in sound recordings. There, the
court said, “The law has ... protected the creative element in intellectual productions—that is, the form or sequence of
expression, the new combination of colors, sounds or words presented by the production ... against appropriation by
others.” Metro. Opera, 101 N.Y.S.2d at 493 .

Modern federal law supports the notion that an express carve-out is required in order to circumscribe the bundle of rights


--- Page 8 ---
appurtenant to copyright. When Congress amended the Copyright Act in 1971 to protect copyrights in sound recordings, it
announced quite explicitly that sound recordings would not carry any right to public performance. The relevant section of
Title 17 limits copyright in sound recordings to the rights, “To reproduce and distribute to the public by sale or other transfer
of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending, reproductions of the copyrighted work if it be a sound recording.” Sound
Recordings Act, Pub.L. No. 92-140, 85 Stat. 391, 391 (1971). The 1971 Act further provided that “the exclusive right of the
owner of a copyright in a sound recording to reproduce it is limited to the right to duplicate the sound recording in a tangible
form,” and that “this right does not extend to ... reproductions made by transmitting organizations exclusively for their own
use.” Id.

This express carve-out for public performance strongly suggest that, absent such an explicit limitations, holder of sound
recording copyrights would have enjoyed the entire bundle of rights traditionally granted to copyright holders—including the
right to public performance, which has been part of the bundle of rights enjoyed by holders of federal copyrights in
performable works since 1897 or earlier. Put otherwise, if public performance rights were not part of the normal bundle of
rights in a copyright, Congress would not have needed to carve out an exception specifically for sound recordings. See
Cent. Virginia Cmty. Coll. v. Katz, 546 U.S. 356 , 375 n. 12,126 S.Ct. 990 , 163 L.Ed.2d 945 (2006) (same principle in the
context of bankruptcy law). 3

[62 F.Supp.3d 342]
Sirius also raises several policy arguments against public performance rights in pre-1972 sound recordings. 4

Sirius claims that affording public performance rights would not serve the underlying purposes of copyright law because pre—
1972 recordings already exist and further rights cannot create incentives for the creation of new pre—1972 recordings.

But the same criticism could be leveled against the New York Courts of Appeals’ decision in Naxos. There, in answer to a
certified question from the Second Circuit, the New York Court of Appeals held that, “New York provides common-law
copyright protection to sound recordings not covered by the federal Copyright Act, regardless of the public domain status in
the country of origin.” Naxos, 4 N.Y.3d at 563 , 797 N.Y.S.2d 352 , 830 N.E.2d 250 . The plaintiffs in Naxos owned several
sound recordings made in the 1930s, which had fallen into the public domain in the United Kingdom where they were
originally copyrighted. Allowing the Naxos plaintiffs to assert their common law right of reproduction could not possibly have
created any incentive to produce new sound recordings—especially since all newly created sound recordings enjoy
exclusive copyright protection under federal law. Yet the New York Court of Appeals held that those plaintiffs could proceed
on their common law copyright infringement claims. From that holding, | conclude that New York does not protect common
law copyrights only when that protection creates incentives for new similar works.

New York is hardly unique in this regard. Each time that Congress is asked to extend the term of copyright protections (a
request not infrequently made), someone

[62 F.Supp.3d 343]

observes that allowing the children and grandchildren of creative people long dead to collect royalties does nothing to
encourage creativity, and so cuts against both the traditional argument in favor of copyright and undermines the historic
belief that, at some point, a Government-created monopoly on intellectual property should yield to an expanded public use.
Congress has rejected that perfectly sensible argument time and time again. | see no reason to conclude that either statutory
or common law copyright any longer focuses on fostering future creativity, as opposed to rewarding past creativity.

Sirius also claims that recognizing public performance rights in pre-1972 sound recordings would unjustly punish good faith
investors who provided capital for Sirius.

Investors always assume the risk that whatever economic model they are working off will turn out not to be correct, so
investor expectations are rarely “settled” enough to provide a justification for declining to apply the correct legal rule.

However, | question whether the investors would be truly surprised if Sirius were to have to pay royalties in order to perform

pre—1972 sound recordings. Sirius, which broadcasts exclusively in non-analog form, must pay royalties under federal law in
order to broadcast post-1972 sound recordings. All Flo and Eddie seeks here is the right to receive royalties under state law
for the digital broadcasting of its pre—1972 recordings—hardly a shocking development in the world of digital broadcasting.

Indeed, as a matter of public policy there would seem to be good reason to harmonize New York's common law of copyright
with its federal statutory counterpart, see 2 Nimmer on Copyright § 8[C][2], and recognizing public performance rights in pre—
1972 sound recordings would conform the two.

In 1995, Congress added a limited right for sound recording copyright holders to publicly perform their works “by means of a
digital audio transmission.” 17 U.S.C. § 106. In creating that limited right, Congress carefully balanced the interests of all
affected parties. As Senator Hatch explained, the bill establishing a public performance right was “forward looking. It largely
leaves in place mature businesses that have grown up under the old copyright regime [i.e., analog broadcasting]. It seeks to
ensure that creators of sound recordings will have the rights they have been denied until now as the digital age dawns.” 141
Cong. Rec. 22,775, 22,779 (1995). By establishing a “new digital performance right [that] applies to digital audio
transmission ... [but] not [ ] to traditional broadcasts and most other free transmissions” Congress “attempted to balance the
competing interests of the various copyright owners as well as users.” /d.; see H.R.Rep. No. 104-274, at 13-15 (1995);


--- Page 9 ---
S.Rep. No. 104-128, at 13-17 (1995), 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 356, 366; see generally Kimberly L. Craft, The Webcasting Music
Revolution Is Ready to Begin, As Soon As We Figure Out the Copyright Law: The Story of the Music Industry at War with
Itself, 24 Hastings Comm. & Ent. L.J. 1, 9-13 (2001) (discussing the legislative history of the 1995 Act).

Sirius would of course respond that any public performance right that the New York Court of Appeals might recognize would
be broader than the right legislated by Congress, encompassing analog broadcasting, the “mature” (some would say dying)
industry that Congress exempted from the payment of royalties for public performance. And Sirius quite rightly notes that the
right Congress has created for post-1972 works is part of a carefully crafted scheme that operates nationwide, whereas
common law copyrights are the

[62 F.Supp.3d 344]

province of the several states—raising the specter of administrative difficulties in the imposition and collection of royalties,
which would ultimately increase the costs consumers pay to hear broadcasts, and possibly make broadcasts of pre—1972
recordings altogether unavailable.

Sirius may well be correct that a legislative solution would be best. But the common law, while a creature of the courts,
exists to protect the property rights of the citizenry. And courts are hardly powerless to craft the sort of exceptions and
limitations Congress has created, or to create a mechanism for administering royalties. Sirius forgets that it was this court,
not Congress, that, back in 1950 fashioned a consent decree that set up what became the most successful mandatory
licensing and royalty scheme in the world—a system still administered by a judge of this court, which functions as a rate
court for the major licensing houses like ASCAP and BMI. See United States v. Am. Soc'y of Composers, Authors and
Publishers, No. CIV.A. 42-245, 1950 WL 42273 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 1950), amended (July 17, 1950); see also United States
v. Broad. Music, Inc., No. 64 CIV. 3787, 1994 WL 901652 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 18, 1994) (modifying 1966 BMI consent decree).
New York courts are capable of fashioning appropriate relief—and even of recognizing only such public performance rights
in pre—1972 sound recordings as conform to rights statutorily conferred on holders of statutory copyright in post-1972
recordings.

In short, general principles of common law copyright dictate that public performance rights in pre-1972 sound recordings do
exist. New York has always protected public performance rights in works other than sound recordings that enjoy the

protection of common law copyright. Sirius suggests no reason why New York—a state traditionally protective of performers
and performance rights—would treat sound recordings differently.

V. Sirius Infringed Flo and Eddie's Common Law Copyright and Engaged in Unfair Competition
A. Common-Law Copyright Infringement
1. Sirius Reproduced Flo and Eddie's Copyrighted Recordings Without Authorization

“A copyright infringement cause of action in New York consists of two elements: (1) the existence of a valid copyright; and
(2) unauthorized reproduction of the work protected by the copyright.” Naxos, 4 N.Y.3d at 563 , 797 N.Y.S.2d 352 , 830
N.E.2d 250 .

As explained above, Flo and Eddie holds a valid copyright in the Turtles recordings. The record clearly shows that Sirius
reproduced those recordings without authorization. In particular, Sirius reproduced Turtles recordings for its three main
databases and associated backups, as well as for the smaller on-site databases, including the database it transferred to
Omnifone. Sirius also made several temporary but complete copies of Turtles recordings: on its play-out server each time a
Turtles song was performed, in each of the five-hour caches, and in the half-hour buffer available on some in-vehicle
satellite radios.

To be sure, some of the alleged copies may not qualify as infringing reproductions. Buffering, for example, does not
constitute infringement under federal law. See Cartoon Network LP, LLLP v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F.3d 121 , 127-30 (2d
Cir.2008). The tips-and-tails partial copies may be too fragmentary or ephemeral to constitute infringement. But Sirius does
not seriously dispute that many of the copies it made of Turtles recordings—in

[62 F.Supp.3d 345]
particular the permanent copies—amount to reproductions as a matter of law.

In reproducing Turtles recordings, Sirius acted without authorization. As noted above, Sirius has not obtained licenses for
using pre—1972 recordings, either to store those recordings in its databases or to broadcast them. Nor has Sirius obtained
licenses or paid royalties for transferring those recordings to third parties.

Sirius argues instead that it is not liable for infringement because it did not distribute the Turtles recordings. Sirius supports
that argument with language from Naxos, “Copyright infringement is distinguishable from unfair competition, which in
addition to unauthorized copying and distribution requires competition in the marketplace or similar actions designed for
commercial benefit.” 4 N.Y.3d at 563 , 797 N.Y.S.2d 352 , 830 N.E.2d 250 . This language, according to Sirius, establishes
that “distribution” of a copyrighted work is an element of common law copyright infringement. A distribution requirement
would be consistent with Sirius's assertion that New York does not provide any exclusive right to publicly perform sound



--- Page 10 ---
recordings.

But as | explained above, New York law does provide copyright holders with just that exclusive performance right for sound
recordings. To the extent that distribution is an element of common law copyright infringement, publicly performing sound
recordings is an act of distribution. Otherwise, Sirius cannot explain how New York courts could have recognized
infringement claims alleging that defendants publicly performed copyrighted works without authorization. See, e.g., Brandon
Films, 230 N.Y.S.2d at 57 —58 ; French, 55 How. Pr. at 472-73, 479-80, 1878 WL 11310.

In addition to Naxos, Sirius cites Hemingway's Estate v. Random House, Inc., 53 Misc.2d 462 , 279 N.Y.S.2d 51 (Sup.Ct.)
aff'd sub nom._29 A.D.2d 633 , 285 N.Y.S.2d 568 (1967) aff'd sub nom._23 N.Y.2d 341 , 296 N.Y.S.2d 771 , 244 N.E.2d 250
(1968) , in which the New York Supreme Court held that a publisher did not infringe the plaintiff's copyright by including
gallery proofs in a few copies of a book before the book was finally published. /d. at 54-56. But public performance rights

were not at issue in Hemingway's Estate, and the Supreme Court never suggested in its opinion that public performance
could not be a form of distribution. Rather, on the facts of the case, that court found that, “No use of any kind was made of

the original galley proofs.” /d. at 55.

One might argue that Flo and Eddie divested itself of its copyright in the Turtles sound recordings by “publishing” those
recordings. See Jewelers’ Mercantile Agency v. Jewelers' Weekly Pub. Co., 155 N.Y. 241 , 247,49 N.E. 872 (1898) .
Publication is a term of art in the common law of copyright and it does not encompass every dissemination of a copyrighted
work, even if the work reaches thousands of people. Jewelers' Mercantile Agency, 155 N.Y. at 247 —48, 49 N.E. 872;
Hemingway's Estate, 279 N.Y.S.2d at 55 .

But there is a good reason why Sirius did not make this argument. In the context of sound recordings, “it has been the law in
[New York] for over 50 years that, in the absence of federal statutory protection, the public sale of a sound recording
otherwise unprotected by statutory copyright does not constitute a publication sufficient to divest the owner of common-law
copyright protection.” Naxos, 4 N.Y.3d at 560 , 797 N.Y.S.2d 352 , 830 N.E.2d 250 ; see also Metro. Opera Ass'n, Inc. v.
Wagner-Nichols Recorder Corp., 199 Misc. 786 , 101 N.Y.S.2d 483 , 493-95 (Sup.Ct.1950) aff'd,

[62 F.Supp.3d 346]

279 A.D. 632 , 107 N.Y.S.2d 795 (1951) . Public sale is exactly what Flo and Eddie have done with the Turtles sound

recordings. Under Naxos, that does not constitute publication. Flo and Eddie therefore retains its common law copyright in
those recordings.

2. Sirius's Creation of Multiple Complete Copies of Flo and Eddie's Sound Recordings Cannot Be Considered Not
Fair Use

Although the case law is sparse, it appears that New York recognizes fair use as a defense to copyright infringement. See
Fendler v. Morosco, 253 N.Y. 281 , 291,171 N.E. 56 (1930) ; EMI Records Lid. v. Premise Media Corp., L.P., 2008 N.Y.
Misc. LEXIS 7485, at *9-11 (N.Y.Sup.Ct. Aug. 8, 2008); Hemingway's Estate, 279 N.Y.S.2d at 57 . New York courts have
not, however, articulated the scope of New York's fair use doctrine. | will assume, as do the parties, that New York's fair use
defense operates similarly to the federal defense, which is codified in 17 U.S.C. § 107. See EMI Records, 2008 N.Y. Misc.
LEXIS 7485, at *16-18.

Under federal law, courts “determin[e] whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use” by considering,
among other factors:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion
used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107.

On all four factors, Sirius's creation of the unauthorized copies fails to qualify as “fair use.”

In considering the first factor—the “purpose and character of the use,” courts must ask “whether the new work merely
supersedes the objects of the original creation or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character
..., in other words, whether and to what extent the new work is transformative.” Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510.
U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (internal citations, quotation marks, and alterations omitted); see
also Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust, 755 F.3d 87 , 96 (2d Cir.2014).

Sirius is a for-profit entity using Flo and Eddie's recordings for commercial purposes. Moreover, Sirius's use is not
transformative. Sirius does not add anything new or change the Turtles recordings by copying and performing them. Publicly
performing a recording adds no “new expression, meaning, or message,” to the recording. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 . Sirius lets subscribers hear Turtles recordings through a different medium, but that does not make its use
“transformative.” insofar as the recording is concerned—however “transformative” satellite radio may be in the context of
broadcasting.


--- Page 11 ---
The cases cited by Sirius do establish that a use may be transformative even when it requires completely copying a
copyrighted work. But the uses in those cases are far different than what Sirius does. Courts, for example, have upheld as

fair use copying images that then appear as “thumbnail” results in response to an internet search. See, e.g., Kelly v. Arriba
Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811 , 818-19 (9th Cir.2003). But a thumbnail is a lower-quality image that does not serve the purpose
of the original—to view and appreciate. /d. Courts have also upheld search engines’ copying original books so that users can
search the books and find out where certain phrases appear. Authors Guild, Inc.

[62 F.Supp.3d 347]
v. Google Inc.,

954 F.Supp.2d 282 , 291 (S.D.N.Y.2013). That too is a different use from the original book, which is meant to be read, not

searched by keyword. /d. What one wants to do with a sound recording is to hear it, and that can be done just by listening to
Sirius.

The second fair use factor “calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than
others.” Campbell,510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . In particular, “creative expression for public dissemination falls within
the core of the copyright's protective purposes.” Campbell,_510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; see Authors Guild, Inc.,_755
F.3d at 96 . Even Sirius recognizes that the Turtles works are “creative.” Sirius claims that the second factor does not favor
Flo and Eddie because the Turtles' sound recordings have been widely disseminated for decades. This is a non-sequitur;
widespread distribution does nothing to alter the creative character of a copyrighted work. The cases Sirius cites does not
hold to the contrary.

The third fair use factor requires courts to consider “amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 107. “The third factor asks whether the secondary use employs more of the
copyrighted work than is necessary, and whether the copying was excessive in relation to any valid purposes asserted
under the first factor.” Authors Guild, Inc.,755 F.3d at 96 . Further, “the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose
and character of the use.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 -87, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Sirius has copied and performed several Turtles
recordings in their entirety. As explained above, Sirius's use is non-transformative and commercial. It has, in the words of
the Second Circuit, no “valid purpose[ ] asserted under the first factor.” Authors Guild, Inc.,755 F.3d at 96 . Thus, the third
factor does not favor even minimal copying by Sirius.

Sirius leans heavily on the fourth fair use factor, “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work.” 17 U.S.C. § 107. This factor “requires courts to consider not only the extent of market harm caused by
the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in
by the defendant would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original.” Campbell,_510 U.S.
at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The Second Circuit has explained that “the relevant market effect with which we are concerned is
the market for plaintiffs' expression, and thus it is the effect of defendants’ use of that expression on plaintiffs’ market that
matters.” NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst., 364 F.3d 471 , 482 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As a
matter of “common sense[ ] when a commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of an original, it clearly
supersedes the objects of the original and serves as a market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable market
harm to the original will occur.” Campbell,510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . (internal citations, quotation marks, and
alterations omitted).

Sirius makes non-transformative use of Flo and Eddie's recordings and does so for commercial gain. It is, therefore,
“common sense{ ],” id., that Flo and Eddie would suffer market harm when Sirius takes its property and exploits it,
unchanged and for a profit. That exploitation “supersedes the objects of the original.” /d.

Sirius responds to this common-sense conclusion with two points: (1) Flo and
[62 F.Supp.3d 348]

Eddie points to no actual evidence or lost sales or licensing fees caused by Sirius's operations; and (2) there is no existing
market for licensing pre—1972 sound recordings for public performance. Those responses are unpersuasive.

First, discovery on damages has not yet been conducted. The evidence might ultimately show that Flo and Eddie has lost
fewer sales than one might expect as a result of Sirius' unauthorized copying and public performances of their recordings.
But it is beyond cavil that Flo and Eddie has hereto been unable to obtain any money from the broadcasting of their sound
recordings; if its common law copyright had been recognized, plaintiff could and undoubtedly would have charged Sirius
something to broadcast them.

Second, Flo and Eddie describes the fourth fair use factor too narrowly. The fourth factor allows courts to consider not only
presently existing markets, but also “potential” or “reasonable, [ ] likely to be developed markets.” Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs.
Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P.,_756 F.3d 73 , 91 (2d Cir.2014) (quotingAm. Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913 , 930 (2d

Cir.1994) ). A market for licensing post-1972 sound recordings already exists. It has to, by law. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 112, 114.
It is not difficult to conceive that a similar market for pre—1972 recordings would develop if owners of those recordings
asserted their rights.



--- Page 12 ---
The fourth factor also requires courts to consider “whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by
the defendant would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original.” Campbell_510 U.S. at
590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Widespread public performance of sound recordings—that is, the conduct in which Sirius is engaged
—could easily satisfy public demand to hear those recordings. That, again as a matter of common sense, could result ina
substantial impact on Flo and Eddie's ability to sell and license Turtles recordings. If a subscriber can easily hear recordings
performed by Sirius, why buy a record or download the recording from iTunes? If a potential licensee wants to perform
Turtles recordings, why pay to do so, when Sirius performs them for free?

3. Sirius Engaged in Unfair Competition

Unfair competition is an “adaptable and capacious” tort that “has been broadly described as encompassing ‘any form of
commercial immorality.’ Roy Exp. Co. v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 672 F.2d 1095 , 1105 (2d Cir.1982) (quoting Metro.
Opera Ass'n, 101 N.Y.S.2d at 492 ). More precisely, New York courts “have long recognized two theories of common-law
unfair competition: palming off and misappropriation.” /TC Ltd. v. Punchgini, Inc.. 9 N.Y.3d 467 , 476-77, 850 N.Y.S.2d 366 ,
880 N.E.2d 852 (2007) . Palming off—‘that is, the sale of the goods of one manufacturer as those of another, id. —is not at
issue in this litigation. “An unfair competition claim involving misappropriation usually concerns the taking and use of the
plaintiff's property to compete against the plaintiff's own use of the same property.” Roy Exp. Co., 672 F.2d at 1105 ; see ITC
Ltd., 9 N.Y.3d at 477 —79, 850 N.Y.S.2d 366 , 880 N.E.2d 852 .

Flo and Eddie's claim involves misappropriation. In particular, it argues that Sirius has taken and used the Turtles recordings
—its property—to compete against it. Sirius does not truly dispute that it has “tak[en] and use[d]” Flo and Eddie's recordings.
Instead Sirius raises two objections to Flo and Eddie's unfair competition claim.

[62 F.Supp.3d 349]

First, Sirius claims that under Naxos, unfair competition requires “distribution” of property. See 4 N.Y.3d at 563 , 797
N.Y.S.2d 352 , 830 N.E.2d 250 . That is a strained reading of Naxos, which described a particular unfair competition claim
grounded in physically pirating and selling records. No other opinion of which | am aware has described “distribution” as a
requirement of the otherwise highly flexible and adaptable unfair competition tort. In any event, as | explained above, public
performance is a form of distribution.

Second, Sirius argues that Flo and Eddie has not suffered any competitive injury. It is now well established that “the
existence of actual competition between the parties is no longer a prerequisite” to sustaining an unfair competition claim.
Metro. Opera Ass'n, 101 N.Y.S.2d at 491 —92 (citing cases); see ITC Ltd., 9 N.Y.3d at 478 , 850 N.Y.S.2d 366 , 880 N.E.2d
852 . Some “competitive injury,” however, is still required. Yantha v. Omni Childhood Ctr., Inc., No. 183-CV-1948, 2013 WL
5327516, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2013). A plaintiff must therefore show, “a direct financial loss, lost dealings, or lost profits
resulting from the anticompetitive acts at issue or, at the very least, that defendant diverted plaintiff's customers and
business to defendant.” /d. (internal citations, quotation marks, and alterations omitted).

Flo and Eddie has satisfied the competitive injury requirement. As | explained when discussing fair use, it is a matter of
economic common sense that Sirius harms Flo and Eddie's sales and potential licensing fees (even if the latter market is not
yet extant) by publicly performing Turtles sound recordings. Evidence of the extent of that loss has not yet been presented
because discovery has not yet been conducted on damages.

VI. Flo and Eddie's Assertion of its Common Law Copyright Is Not Barred by the Dormant Commerce Clause
Finally, Sirius argues that Flo and Eddie's claims are barred by the Dormant Commerce Clause. Sirius is wrong.

The Constitution grants to Congress “Power ... To regulate Commerce ... among the several States ....” U.S. Const. art. |, §
8. Although the Commerce Clause is written as an affirmative grant of power to Congress, the Supreme Court has held that

it includes a negative or “dormant” implication that states may not interfere with interstate commerce. Healy v. Beer Inst.
Inc., 491 U.S. 324 , 326 n. 1,109 S.Ct. 2491 , 105 L.Ed.2d 275 (1989) .

States may run afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause's implied limits on their power in several ways: by discriminating
against out-of-state goods, see, e.g., Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437 , 454-57, 112 S.Ct. 789 , 117 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992) ,
by imposing generally applicable regulations that have the effect of excessively burdening interstate commerce, see, e.g.,
Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 , 142-46, 90 S.Ct. 844 , 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970) , or by directly regulating
commerce in other states, see, e.g., Healy, 491 U.S. at 335 —40, 109 S.Ct. 2491 . Sirius argues that the last prohibition—
directly regulating commerce in other states—applies here.

Flo and Eddie argues that the Court need not reach the constitutional question because Congress has authorized New York
to regulate pre-1972 sound recordings.

It is hornbook law that “Congress may authorize the States to engage in regulation that the Commerce Clause would
otherwise forbid.”

[62 F.Supp.3d 350]


--- Page 13 ---
Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131 , 138, 106 S.Ct. 2440 , 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986) . “But because of the important role the
Commerce Clause plays in protecting the free flow of interstate trade, th[e Supreme] Court has exempted state statutes from

the implied limitations of the Clause only when the congressional direction to do so has been ‘unmistakably clear.’ ” /d. at
138-39, 106 S.Ct. 2440 (quoting S.- Cent. Timber Dev., Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82 , 91,104 S.Ct. 2237 , 81 L.Ed.2d 71
(1984) ); see Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. at 458 , 112 S.Ct. 789 (requiring an “unambiguous” congressional directive).

Flo and Eddie claims to find unambiguous Congressional authorization for New York's common law copyright scheme to be
exempted from the implied limitations of the Commerce Clause in 17 U.S.C. § 301(c), which reads in full:

With respect to sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, any rights or remedies under the common law
or statutes of any State shall not be annulled or limited by this title until February 15, 2067. The preemptive
provisions of subsection (a) shall apply to any such rights and remedies pertaining to any cause of action arising
from undertakings commenced on and after February 15, 2067. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 303, no
sound recording fixed before February 15, 1972, shall be subject to copyright under this title before, on, or after
February 15, 2067.

In one of the two companion cases between Flo and Eddie and Sirius, my colleague in the District Court for the Central
District of California found that § 301(c) unambiguously authorizes Flo and Eddie's companion California-law action. Ina
footnote, it dismissed with almost no discussion a Dormant Commerce Clause challenge similar to the one Sirius raises
here, stating that “Because Congress specifically authorized protection of pre—1972 sound recording rights by the states in
17 U.S.C. § 301(c), the California statute protecting those rights is not subject to the Commerce Clause.” Flo & Eddie Inc. v.
Sirius XM Radio Inc., No. CV 13-5693, 2014 WL 4725382, at *9n. 1 (C.D.Cal. Sept. 22, 2014).

However, | do not find the California Court's analysis persuasive, as it does not explain why the cited statute qualifies as a
Commerce Clause exemption. And Flo and Eddie cites no legislative history or case law indicating that Congress intended
to eliminate Dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny for state common law copyright. Instead, Flo and Eddie emphasizes the
word “any,” which it argues is an indication that Congress intended to permit “all” state statutes regulating copyright.

| do not read the cited section as Flo and Eddie does. | note that § 301(c) is contained in the section of the federal copyright
law that addresses the law's preemptive scope. Thus, the language cited by Flo and Eddie could plausibly be interpreted,
not to allow states to impose otherwise unconstitutional burdens on interstate commerce, but only to limit the scope of
federal copyright law—by excluding, for a period of time, otherwise preempted state laws from the preemptive reach of 17
U.S.C. § 301(a). Under this interpretation, although § 301(c) broadly reaches “any” state right or remedy, it shields state
regulation only from statutory preemption, not from Commerce Clause scrutiny.

The Supreme Court has construed an analogous statute in this very manner when analyzing a Dormant Commerce Clause

challenge. In New England Power Co. v. New Hampshire, 455 U.S. 331 , 102 S.Ct. 1096 , 71 L.Ed.2d 188 (1982) , the Court
decided whether Section 201 of the Federal Power Act was “an affirmative grant of power to the states to burden

[62 F.Supp.3d 351]

interstate commerce.” Id. at 341, 102 S.Ct. 1096 . Subsection 201(b) provided that no provisions of the subchapter of which
it was a part—including the sweeping preemption provisions of § 201(a)—‘shall ... deprive a State or State commission of its
lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a State line.” /d.
(quoting 16 U.S.C. § 824(b) ).

The Court held that § 201(b) did “[nJothing ... to alter the limits of state power otherwise imposed by the Commerce Clause,”
but “simply save[d] from pre-emption under Part Il of the Federal Power Act such state authority as was otherwise lawful.” /d.
(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). So it is with 17 U.S.C. § 301(c). Like the statute at issue in New England
Power, § 301(c) is framed as a limitation on preemption, not a relaxation of Commerce Clause limitations. That interpretation
is even more persuasive here because, unlike in the statute analyzed in New England Power, § 301(c) makes no explicit
reference to any sort of interstate commerce.

Even if the matter is not free from doubt, at the very least it is reasonable to interpret § 301(c) as a provision about federal
statutory preemption, and not as an authorization for states to interfere with interstate commerce. That being so, § 301(c)
does not “unambiguous|ly],” Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. at 458 , 112 S.Ct. 789 , or “unmistakably,” S.- Cent. Timber,
467 U.S. at 91 , 104 S.Ct. 2237 , permit state interference with interstate commerce in connection with pre-—1972 sound
recordings.

Therefore, and applying the reasoning of New England Power, | decline to adopt Flo and Eddie's interpretation of § 301(c).

However, Sirius's Dormant Commerce Clause challenge fails for a different reason: New York does not “regulate” anything
by recognizing common law copyright. The issue is nothing more than a red herring.

The Clause itself “withholds from the states[,] the power to regulate Commerce among the several States.” SSC Corp. v.
Town of Smithtown, 66 F.3d 502 , 510 (2d Cir.1995) (original alterations omitted). Thus, “the strictures of the dormant
Commerce Clause are not activated unless a state action may be characterized as a ‘regulation.’ ” /d.; United Haulers Ass'n,



--- Page 14 ---
Inc. v. Oneida—Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth.,_261 F.3d 245 , 254 (2d Cir.2001) affd,_550 U.S. 330 , 127 S.Ct. 1786 ,

167 L.Ed.2d 655 (2007) ; Metro. Washington Chapter v. D.C., No. CV 12-853, 57 F.Supp.3d 1, 25-26, 2014 WL 3400569, at
*16 (D.D.C. July 14, 2014).

Typically, courts have applied that principle in the context of the market participant exception, holding that states do not
“regulate” commerce by actively participating in commercial markets. See, e.g., SSC Corp., 66 F.3d at 510.

But it is not only market participation that falls outside Dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny. In Sherlock v. Alling, 93 U.S. (3
Otto) 99, 23 L.Ed. 819 (1876) , the Supreme Court considered whether an Indiana statute establishing liability for wrongful

death, “if applied to cases of marine torts, would constitute a new burden upon commerce.” /d. at 101-02 The Court affirmed
the general principle that “States cannot by legislation place burdens upon commerce with foreign nations or among the
several States.” /d. at 102. But it noted that in every case where it had found a Dormant Commerce Clause violation, “the

legislation adjudged invalid imposed a tax upon some instrument or subject of commerce, or exacted a license fee from
parties engaged in commercial pursuits, or created an impediment to the free

[62 F.Supp.3d 352]

navigation of some public waters, or prescribed conditions in accordance with which commerce in particular articles or
between particular places was required to be conducted.” /d. By contrast, the Indiana statute at issue “only declare[d] a
general principle respecting the liability of all persons within the jurisdiction of the State for torts.” /d. at 103.

The Court explained that “General legislation ... prescribing the liabilities or duties of citizens of a State ... is not open to any
valid objection because it may affect persons engaged in foreign or inter-State commerce.” /d. Otherwise, “Objection might
with equal propriety be urged against legislation prescribing the form in which contracts shall be authenticated, or property
descend or be distributed on the death of its owner, because applicable to the contracts or estates of persons engaged in
such commerce.” /d. Since Sherlock was decided, courts have rejected Dormant Commerce Clause challenges for the
reasons it cites. See, e.g., Atl. Coast Line R. Co. v. Mazursky, 216 U.S. 122 , 132-34, 30 S.Ct. 378 , 54 L.Ed. 411 (1910)
(challenge to a law attaching liability to common carriers who failed to settle loss claims within forty days); Stone ex rel.
Estate of Stone v. Frontier Airlines, Inc., 256 F.Supp.2d 28 , 46 (D.Mass.2002) (challenge to tort action attaching liability to
airline's failure to carry a defibrillator ); D.C. v. Beretta, U.S.A., Corp., 872 A.2d 633 , 656-57 (D.C.2005) (challenge to
statute attaching strict liability to actions by firearms manufacturers); West v. Broderick & Bascom Rope Co.,_197 N.W.2d
202 , 214-15 (lowa 1972) (challenge to negligence action asserting failure-to-warn liability) (collecting cases).

What Sirius objects to is a “general principle respecting the liability of all persons within the jurisdiction of” New York.
Sherlock, 93 U.S. (3 Otto) at 103. In particular, Sirius objects to property law principles that establish liability for infringing
another party's copyright. But that property law principle is not a state-imposed regulation—even when applied to public
performances by a national broadcaster. Sirius has not cited, and the Court has not found any cases holding that a state's
general property law and associated liability principles could, in and of themselves, violate the Dormant Commerce Clause.

Holding Sirius liable might affect interstate commerce—ijust as a finding of liability did in Sherlock. Id. at 103. But concluding
that Sirius is liable under New York property law principles would not amount to a “regulation” of interstate commerce by
New York. It would, therefore, not give rise to a Dormant Commerce Clause claim.

Sirius is correct that this holding is unprecedented (aside from the companion California case, which reached the same
result), and will have significant economic consequences. Radio broadcasters—terrestrial and satellite—have adapted to an
environment in which they do not pay royalties for broadcasting pre-1972 sound recordings. Flo and Eddie's suit threatens
to upset those settled expectations. Other broadcasters, including those who publicly perform media other than sound
recordings, will undoubtedly be sued in follow-on actions, exposing them to significant liability. And if different states adopt
varying regulatory schemes for pre—1972 sound recordings, or if holders of common law copyrights insist on licensing
performance rights on a state-by-state basis (admittedly, an unlikely result, since such behavior could well cause
broadcaster to lose interest in playing their recordings) it could upend the analog and digital broadcasting industries.

But in the end, all this case presents me with is a suit between private parties seeking
[62 F.Supp.3d 353]

to vindicate private property rights—not a challenge to state regulation. That lawsuit can and will be resolved on its merits.
The broader policy problems are not for me to consider. They are the province of Congress, the New York Legislature, and
perhaps the New York Court of Appeals.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Sirius's motion for summary judgment is DENIED. The Clerk of the Court is directed to remove
Docket # 46 from the Court's list of pending motions. Sirius is ORDERED to advise the Court by Friday, December 5 of any
remaining disputes of material fact that would require a trial. Otherwise, the Court will enter summary judgment in favor of
Flo and Eddie as to liability and proceed to an inquest on damages.


--- Page 15 ---
Notes:

1Flo and Eddie describes the five-hour time-shifting as Sirius's “On Demand” feature. Although the parties are not entirely clear, it appears that “On
Demand” and “Start Now” are separate features. The allegedly unauthorized copy made for time-shifting purposes is properly referred to as “Start Now.” (
See Geller Decl., Ex. 8; Smith Decl. ¥ 33.)

2One very recent decision of the New York State Supreme Court appears to recognize just the sort of public performance right that Sirius says does not
exist. See Capitol Records, LLC v. Harrison Greenwich, LLC, 44 Misc.3d 202 , 984 N.Y.S.2d 274 , 275-76 (Sup.Ct.2014) ; Decision and Order, Capitol
Records, LLC v. Harrison Greenwich, LLC, No. 652249/2012 (N.Y.Sup.Ct. May 13, 2014). But that Decision and Order does not explain its ruling and
cites no prior case law recognizing any public performance right in sound recordings, so | can take no guidance from it.

3The history of Congressional grants of public performance rights is convoluted. The 1831 Act, which first granted copyright protection to authors of
musical compositions, did not provide a public performance right. See Act of Feb. 3, 1831, ch. 16, § 1, 4 Stat. 436. When Congress added copyright
protection for “dramatic composition[s]” in 1856, it expressly included a “sole right to ... perform, or represent” the composition, without providing any
comparable right for copyrights in other works. Act of Aug. 18, 1856, ch. 169, 11 Stat. 138, 139. That state of affairs continued through the general
copyright law revisions of 1870 in which Congress expressly provided a “public[ ] perform[ance]” right for dramatic compositions but not for musical
compositions. Act of July 8, 1870, ch. 230, § 86, 16 Stat. 198, 212. Finally, in 1897, Congress added a public performance right specifically for musical
compositions. Act of Jan. 6, 1897, ch. 4, 29 Stat. 481, 481-82. When Congress revised the copyright law in 1909, it continued to provide the holders of
copyrights in dramatic compositions and musical compositions with the exclusive right to “perform [their works] publicly.” Act of Mar. 3, 1909, ch. 320, § 1,
35 Stat. 1075, 1075. Other types of works, however, did not enjoy that same privilege.

By the time Congress enacted copyright protection for sound recordings, public performance rights were firmly entrenched for musical
compositions and dramatic compositions: the two kinds of works to which public performance rights could sensibly be provided. It was thus
an accepted part of the background law that public performance rights would, absent a deliberate effort to exclude them, extend to sound
recordings. That principle applies with even more force to common law copyright, which generally includes fewer limitations on exclusive
rights than does federal statutory law. See Shyamkrishna Balganesh, The Pragmatic Incrementalism of Common Law Intellectual Property,
63 V and. L.Rev. 1543, 1563 (2010).

4 Sirius frames these arguments with the general principle that federal courts should apply state common law as it currently stands—not as they think it
should be. That is a correct statement of the role of federal courts. But | am not applying the law as | think it “should” be, but as | “predict how the New
York Court of Appeals would resolve the ... question.” DiBella v. Hopkins, 403 F.3d 102 , 111 (2d Cir.2005). Unlike the Second Circuit, | do not have the
option to certify even profoundly uncertain issues of state law to the Court of Appeals.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
STEARNS, District Judge.

This case involves the alleged infringement of the copyrights to English language translations of ancient Greek religious
texts. Society of the Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Inc. (Monastery), alleges that Archbishop Gregory of Denver, Colorado
(Archbishop) has infringed its copyrights in the disputed texts. On July 23, 2010, the Monastery moved for summary
judgment on the remaining claim in this case, the infringement by the Archbishop of the copyright on six of the Monastery's
works: the Psalter Work, the Prayer Book Work, the Great Horologion Work, the Pentecostarion Work, the Collected
Dismissal Hymns Work, and the Octoechos Work (collectively, the Works). 1 The court heard oral argument on the motion on
November 18, 2010.

BACKGROUND

The bulk of the underlying facts are set forth in the court's February 18, 2010 Memorandum and Order and need not be
repeated here. Additional pertinent facts are as follows. The Monastery published and/or registered the individual works with
the U.S. Copyright Office on the following

[754 F.Supp.2d 223]

dates: (1) the Psalter Work was published in March of 1975, and registered in 1975, and again in 1986; (2) the Prayer Book
Work was published in July of 1988, and registered in November of 1988; (3) the Horologion Work was published in October
of 1997, and registered in December of 1997; (4) the Pentecostarion Work was published in 1990, and registered in June of
1986; (5) the Dismissal Hymns Work was never published, but was registered in December of 1987; (6) the Octoechos
Work was never published, but was registered in June of 1986. Members of the Monastery collaborated on the creation of
the Works, and their sale is a source of income sustaining the Monastery. Corr. Jt. Stmt. Mat. Undisp. Facts § 1-19, 92. In
August of 2007, the Archbishop caused or permitted versions of the Works to be posted on his website, www.
trueorthodoxy. info. 2The Monastery alleges that some of the posted Works infringed its copyrights. Corr. Jt. Stmt. Mat.
Undisp. Facts ¥ 22-59, 108.

On December 28, 2007, the Monastery filed a Complaint against the Archbishop in the U.S. District Court. The
Archbishop responded with a motion to dismiss on February 18, 2008, followed by an Answer on April 24, 2008. The motion
to dismiss was denied by the court on April 14, 2008. After the close of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for partial
summary judgment. On February 18, 2010, the court granted the Monastery's motion for partial summary judgment on its
breach of contract claim and on the infringement claim regarding the St. Isaac Work. The court also denied the Archbishop's
cross-motion for partial summary judgment. The Monastery now moves for summary judgment on the remaining claims of
copyright infringement.

DISCUSSION

Summary judgment is appropriate when “the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any
affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). “A ‘genuine’ issue is one that could be resolved in favor of either party, and a ‘material fact’ is
one that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case.” Calero—Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,355 F.3d 6 , 19 (1st
Cir.2004), citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby. Inc., 477 U.S. 242 , 248-250, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) . “[I]fa
party resists summary judgment by pointing to a factual dispute on which it bears the burden at trial [e.g., an affirmative
defense], that party must point to evidence affirmatively tending to prove the fact in its favor.” FDIC v. Elder Care Servs.
Inc., 82 F.3d 524 , 526 (1st Cir.1996).

To establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show: (1) ownership of a valid copyright in a work; and (2) copying
of constituent elements of the work that are original. Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland, Int'l, Inc., 49 F.3d 807 , 813 (1st Cir.1995),



--- Page 2 ---
citing Feist Publ'ns. Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) . “ ‘In judicial
proceedings, a certificate of copyright registration constitutes prima facie evidence of copyrightability and shifts the burden to

the defendant to demonstrate why the copyright is not valid.’ ” /d., quoting Bibbero Sys.. Inc. v. Colwell Sys., Inc., 893 F.2d
1104 , 1106 (9th Cir.1990).

[754 F.Supp.2d 224]

Where a work is made for hire, the Copyright Act provides that the employer is the author and owns the copyright, “ ‘unless
the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument signed by them.’ ""Saenger Org.. Inc. v. Nationwide Ins.
Licensing Assocs., Inc., 119 F.3d 55 , 59 (1st Cir.1997), quoting 17 U.S.C. § 201(b).

|. Validity of the Copyrights

The Archbishop argues that the Monastery does not own valid copyrights in the Works for three reasons: (1) the
Monastery is not the rightful owner of the copyrights; (2) the Monastery allowed its works to pass into the public domain by
publishing them without copyright notice; and (3) the Monastery's translations lack the originality necessary to be
copyrightable. See Def.'s Opp'n Mem.

1. Ownership of the Copyrights

In his opposition to the Monastery's motion for summary judgment, the Archbishop reiterates his allegation that the
Monastery is not the owner of the copyrights at issue because they belong to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia
(ROCOR). 2 This argument has been previously considered and rejected by the court. Feb. 18, 2010 Mem. and Order, 685.
F.Supp.2d at 225 —26, 228-29. Notwithstanding the rejection, the Archbishop again invites the court to delve into the
byzantine intricacies of the doctrine of neutral principles as it applies to ecclesiastical disputes.

As the court stated in its February 18, 2010 Memorandum and Order, the Copyright Act provides a statutory answer to
the copyright issue that makes it unnecessary to consult the canonical traditions of the Orthodox Church. After 1978, a
transfer of copyright, other than by operation of law, “is not valid unless an instrument of conveyance, or a note or
memorandum of the transfer, is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner's duly authorized
agent.” 17 U.S.C. § 204(a). The Archbishop does not allege the existence of any writing by the Monastery evincing an intent
to transfer ownership of the copyrights to ROCOR (or to anyone else). Instead, he argues that the Monastery's copyrights
were transferred to ROCOR by operation of law because of the Monastery's decision to disaffiliate itself from ROCOR. Def.'s
Opp'n Mem. at 6-20.

In support of this argument, the Archbishop cites cases in which courts have found copyrights to be transferred by
operation of law without the necessity of a writing. See id. at 18-20. These cases arose in fairly predictable contexts, such as
a bankruptcy proceeding, a foreclosure, a merger, or the transfer of assets from a dissolved corporation to its shareholders.
See, e.g., Brooks v. Bates, 781 F.Supp. 202 (S.D.N.Y.1991) . See also U.S. Home Corp. v. R.A. Kot Homes, Inc., 563
E.Supp.2d 971 , 976 (D.Minn.2008) ( “Courts have interpreted a transfer by ‘operation of law’ to include mergers and any
other transaction that ‘establish[es] the author's express or implied consent’ to transfer the copyright.”). The Monastery's
spiritual secession from ROCOR has no analogy to a corporate transaction involving the express or implied agreement to
transfer ownership of assets or to a court-ordered transfer of property from a debtor to a creditor. The court is simply not
persuaded by the Archbishop's complinic operation of law argument.

2. Publication without Notice
The Archbishop next argues that some of the Works were published without

[754 F.Supp.2d 225]

copyright notice and are therefore in the public domain. See Def.'s Am. Answer at 11; Def.'s Proposed Facts at {{] 30-38.
“The common law recognizes three ways of exposing a work to the public: exhibition or performance, limited publication,
and general publication. Of these, only general publication results in loss of the common law copyright by the creator.” Burke
v. Nat'l Broad. Co., Inc., 598 F.2d 688 , 691 (1st Cir.1979). A general publication occurs “when a work is made available to
members of the public at large without regard to who they are or what they propose to do with it.” /d. In contrast, a limited
publication occurs “when tangible copies of the work are distributed, but to a limited class of persons and for a limited
purpose.” /d. at 692. A limited publication does not extinguish a copyright. /d. at 691. See also John G. Danielson, Inc. v.
Winchester—Conant Props., Inc., 322 F.3d 26 , 35-36 (1st Cir.2003) (finding that a limited publication or display of a work
does not constitute a “distribution” for copyright purposes). Not unexpectedly, the unauthorized distribution of a work by a
third party also does not extinguish copyright protection. See Cipes v. Mikasa, Inc.. 346 F.Supp.2d 371 , 375 (D.Mass.2004)
(‘[A]n unauthorized user lacks not only the right, but also the ability to ‘publish’ an author's work and any attempt to do so is
ineffective.”).

The Archbishop alleges that the Monastery published its Dismissal Hymns and Pentecostarion Works, and portions of
the Horologion Work and Prayer Book Work, without copyright notice. See Def.'s Proposed Facts §{] 27-35. The evidence
that the Archbishop provides to support this allegation is neither clear nor persuasive. See Def.'s Opp'n Mem. at 4-5. The


--- Page 3 ---
Monastery admits that on occasion over the years, it has provided portions of the translations-in-progress for parish use and
for the solicitation of religious and literary critiques. Corr. Jt. Stmt. Mat. Undisp. Facts § 93. The distribution by the
Monastery of the Works to a select group of co-religionists for restricted purposes constitutes a limited publication as a
matter of law. See Burke,_598 F.2d at 692 (“At common law the creator of a literary or artistic work has the right to copy and
profit from it, and can distribute or show it to a limited class of persons for a limited purpose without losing that right.”). See
also Patterson v. Century Prods., Inc., 93 F.2d 489 , 492-493 (2d Cir.1937) (finding that exhibitions of a film to religious,
educational, and social organizations without charge did not constitute a general publication that would invalidate the
copyright). To the extent that third parties may have disseminated the Works without the Monastery's authorization (there is
no evidence in the record that this occurred), no publication in a legally meaningful sense took place.

3. Originality

The Archbishop finally disputes the validity of the Monastery's copyrights on the grounds that the Works lack
originality. See Def. Mot. Amend Answer; Def.'s Opp'n Mem. at 22. In a copyright infringement action, the plaintiff bears the
burden of proving that the work, as a whole, is original and that it has complied with the statutory formalities. Lotus Dev.
Corp., 49 F.3d at 813 . Original does not mean novel—‘the requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount
will suffice.” Feist, 499 U.S. at 345 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 . Whether or not a work is original is a question that the court can
determine as a matter of law. See CMM Cable Rep. Inc. v. Ocean Coast Prop.. Inc., 97 F.3d 1504 , 1517 (1st Cir.1996)
(affirming summary judgment on the originality of a promotional contest theme, stating “[w]hile we do not dispute that the
question of originality can be a question of fact for the

[754 F.Supp.2d 226]

jury, it is not necessarily so.”); see also Feist, 499 U.S. at 341 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 (1991) (deciding a question of originality as a
matter of law).

The Copyright Act protects translations of preexisting works, including religious texts, as “original works of authorship.”
See 17 U.S.C. § 102; see also Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, Inc. v. Otsar Sifrei Lubavitch, Inc., 312 F.3d 94 , 97 (2d Cir.2002)
(concluding that an English translation of a Hebrew prayerbook reflected sufficient originality to be a copyrightable work).
The Monastery claims that all six Works are “unique translations of preexisting public domain works originally authored in
foreign languages; i.e., derivative works.” Corr. Jt. Stmt. Mat. Undisp. Facts 101. The Archbishop alleges that the Works
lack originality because they duplicate portions of preexisting third-party translations. However, he does not provide any
evidence to support this allegation, see Def.'s Opp'n Mem. at 20-22, while the Monastery provides detailed side-by-side
comparisons, illustrating the significant differences between the Monastery's Works and those cited by the Archbishop. See
Pl.'s Reply Mem., App.

Because the Archbishop has failed to raise any genuine dispute regarding ownership of the copyrights, the prior

publication of the Works without copyright notice, or their originality, the Monastery's copyrights are presumptively valid. See
17 U.S.C. § 410(c).

Il. Copying

To establish copyright infringement, the Monastery must also show “copying of constituent elements of the work [by
the defendant] that are original.” See Lotus Dev. Corp., 49 F.3d at 813 , citing Feist_499 U.S. at 361 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 . To
prove copying, a plaintiff must show that the defendant copied the work, and that the copying was so extensive that it
rendered the infringing and copyrighted works “substantially similar.” Johnson v. Gordon, 409 F.3d 12 , 17-18 (1st Cir.2005).
Copying may be inferred from a showing that a defendant had access to a plaintiff's work prior to publishing his own, and
that there is a substantial similarity between the two works. See Grubb v. KMS Patriots, L.P., 88 F.3d 1 , 3 (1st Cir.1996).
“Substantial similarity exists if a reasonable, ordinary observer, upon examination of the two works, would conclude that the
defendant unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff's protectable expression.”_Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. ASP Consulting LLC.
560 F.3d 53 , 58 (1st Cir.2009) (internal quotations omitted). “Case law supports the ‘ordinary observer’ test and the
disregard of minor differences in favor of major similarity.” Matthews v. Freedman, 157 F.3d 25 , 28 (1st Cir.1998).

The Archbishop is a former member of the Monastery. While at the Monastery, he participated in the creation of many
of the Works. He does not dispute that he possesses copies of all seven Works at issue in this case. See Corr. Jt. Stmt. Mat.
Undisp. Facts § | 65-84, 98, 102; Def.'s Opp'n Mem. at 23-24. The evidence compels a finding that the Archbishop had
access to the Works prior to August of 2007, when the allegedly infringing material was posted on his website.

The Monastery does not claim that the Archbishop made wholesale reproductions of the six Works; rather, the
Monastery alleges that the Archbishop reproduced portions of the Works interspersed with filler material. Pl.'s Summ. J.
Mem. at 21. The Monastery again provides side-by-side comparisons, which show identical and near-identical similarities
between portions of all six Works and the Archbishop's website

[754 F.Supp.2d 227]

postings. “Applying the ordinary observer test, the slight textual differences between the two are insufficient as a matter of
law to render the Archbishop's versions not “substantially similar” to the infringed portions of the Works copyrighted by the


--- Page 4 ---
Monastery. 5 See Segrets, Inc. v. Gillman Knitwear Co., Inc., 207 F.3d 56 , 66 (1st Cir.2000) (affirming the district court's
findings that two of defendant's sweater designs were, as a matter of law, substantially similar to plaintiff's copyrighted
design, where the designs differed in but a few details).

lll. Fair Use Defense

The court previously found that the Archbishop's reproduction of a portion of the St. Isaac Work on his website did not
constitute fair use. The court evaluated the Archbishop's use of the copyrighted material in light of the four factors set out in
17 U.S.C. § 107 and found that each of the four factors weighed in the Monastery's favor. Feb. 18, 2010 Mem. and Order,
685 F.Supp.2d at 226 —28. The Archbishop reiterates the fair use defense with respect to the remaining six Works and
attempts to rebut specific points raised by the court in previously rejecting the defense.

“Fair use is an affirmative defense,” and the burden of proof is on the accused infringer rather than the copyright
holder. See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 590, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) . In
determining whether the use of a copyrighted work is fair, a court is to evaluate and weigh as a whole the four factors set out
in 17 U.S.C. § 107 (the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copied work, the extent of the copying, and its
effect on the market value of the work). See Nufiez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp., 235 F.3d 18 , 21-26 (1st Cir.2000).

Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact. See Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539 , 560,
105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . “If there are no genuine issues of material fact, or if, even after resolving all issues
in favor of the opposing party, a reasonable trier of fact can reach only one conclusion, a court may conclude as a matter of
law whether the challenged use qualifies as a fair use of the copyrighted work.” Los Angeles News Serv. v. KCAL-TV
Channel 9,108 F.3d 1119 , 1120 (9th Cir.1997), quoting Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Moral Majority. Inc., 796 F.2d 1148 , 1150
(9th Cir.1986). See also Blanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d 244 , 249 (2d Cir.2006) (upholding district court's grant of summary
judgment on the fair use defense); Nufiez,235 F.3d at 21 (“When the district court, as here, has found sufficient facts to
evaluate each of the statutory factors, we need not remand but may determine fair use as a matter of law.”).

With regard to the first factor—the purpose and character of the use—this court found that since the Archbishop's
placing of the St. Isaac Work on the Internet was not sufficiently transformative, this factor

[754 F.Supp.2d 228]

weighed in favor of the Monastery. /d. at 226-27. The Archbishop argues that a work need not be transformative to
constitute fair use. Def.'s Opp'n Mem. at 22, citing Campbell,_510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Campbell states:

[a]lthough such transformative use is not absolutely necessary for a finding of fair use, the goal of copyright, to promote
science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works. Such works thus lie at the heart of the
fair use doctrine's guarantee of breathing space within the confines of copyright, and the more transformative the new work,
the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.

Id. Thus, while it is true that transformative use is not an absolute requirement for a finding of fair use, its absence enhances
the significance of the other factors that weigh against a finding of fair use. As the court determined previously, the three
other statutory factors (the nature of the copied work, the extent of the copying, and its effect on the market value of the
work) all favor the Monastery. The Archbishop does not provide any new evidence (or argument) that would alter the court's
prior balancing of these factors. See Def.'s Opp'n Mem. at 23-24. Therefore, the Archbishop's fair use defense also fails with
respect to the remaining six Works. IV. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Safe Harbor Defense

In his opposition to the Monastery's motion for summary judgment, the Archbishop raises a matinal affirmative
defense: he argues that he is immune from liability for infringement under the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
17 U.S.C. §§ 101, et seq. The Archbishop alleges that he qualifies as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and therefore falls
within the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA, which protect ISPs who are not direct infringers. See Def.'s Opp'n Mem. at 4;
Def.'s Surreply Mem. J. at 2-6.

An affirmative defense not pleaded as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c) is waived, Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe
Mfg. Corp., 15 F.3d 1222 , 1226 (1st Cir.1994), although “[w]hen there is no prejudice and when fairness dictates, the
strictures of [the raise or waive] rule may be relaxed.” Jakobsen v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 520 F.2d 810 , 813 (1st
Cir.1975). “Moreover, when an affirmative defense that has not been raised in the pleadings has actually been tried by
implied consent of the parties, the court must treat the defense as if it had been raised in the original responsive pleading.”
Conjugal P'ship v. Conjugal P'ship, 22 F.3d 391 , 400 (1st Cir.1994). Implied consent, however, will be found only when the
opposing party “did not object to the introduction of evidence or introduced evidence himself that was relevant only to [the
affirmative defense].” Lynch v. Dukakis. 719 F.2d 504 , 508 (1st Cir.1983). Compare Wolf v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.
71 F.3d 444 , 446 (1st Cir.1995) (defendant sought on the eve of trial to change the theory of the case by converting a
general Rule 12(b)(6) demurrer into a specific defense of ERISA preemption).

The Archbishop did not raise the DMCA safe harbor defense in either his answer or his amended answer. See Def.'s
Answer and Affirmative Defenses; Def.'s Mot. to Amend Answer—Ex. B. As a result, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c) and Knapp
Shoes, the defense is waived. In the context of this case, fairness does not dictate otherwise. The Archbishop's DMCA safe


--- Page 5 ---
harbor defense has not been tried by implied
[754 F.Supp.2d 229]
consent of the parties. ©

In sum, the Monastery has fulfilled its burden of proving the elements of copyright infringement, while the Archbishop
has not met his burden of proving any of his affirmative defenses or of raising any material dispute of fact that would require
the intervention of a jury. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment will be ALLOWED as to the copyright infringement
claim.

V. Damages

The Monastery argues that damages for the Archbishop's breach of contract and his infringement of the copyright in
the St. Isaac Work and the other six of the Monastery's Works, as well as attorneys’ fees, costs, and other equitable and
statutory relief, may be determined by the court if it determines, as it has, that the Archbishop is liable on the remaining
infringement claims. Pl.'s Resp. Ct.'s March 31, 2010 Order at 2. Copyright damages are usually measured as the loss in
the fair market value of the copyright, that is, by calculating the profits lost as a result of the infringement. Data Gen. Corp. v.
Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147 , 1173 (1st Cir.1994). A plaintiff may also recover the infringer's
(nonduplicative) profits. /d.

In its Complaint, the Monastery states that it “is entitled to a permanent injunction and an award of its actual damages
and any profits of Defendant under 17 U.S.C. §§ 502, 504(a)(1), and 504(b).” Compl. 451. “[l]t is beyond dispute that a
plaintiff who seeks to recover actual damages is entitled to a jury trial.” See 3 Nimmer on Copyright § 12.10[A]. As a practical
matter, however, the Monastery's 30(b)(6) witness testified that as of the day of his deposition, the Monastery could not
specify “a monetary quantifiable estimate of harms, damages, and losses” that the Monastery could attribute to the alleged
infringement. Corr. Jt. Stmt. Mat. Undisp. Facts ¥ 110. Moreover, the Archbishop has never charged fees to access any of
the website material at issue, and the Monastery has pointed to no actual profits that it could recover from the Archbishop.
See id. J 107. The issue of actual damages would thus appear to be a damp squib.

The Monastery has also pled the option of electing statutory damages. Compl. at 10 (‘In the alternative, and if Plaintiff
so elects, award Plaintiff statutory damages in the amount of $150,000 per each of the Copyrighted Works infringed by
Defendant, on account of Defendant's willfulness.”). When a plaintiff in a copyright infringement action elects statutory
damages, it remains the case that the defendant is entitled in most instances to a jury trial. See Feltner v. Columbia Pictures
Television, Inc., 523 U.S. 340 , 355,118 S.Ct. 1279 , 140 L.Ed.2d 438 (1998) (holding that the Seventh Amendment
provides a right to a jury trial when statutory damages are claimed under Section 504(c) of the Copyright Act); see also
Segrets, 207 F.3d at 66 . However, where a plaintiff agrees to accept the minimum amount of statutory damages available,
the defendant's

[754 F.Supp.2d 230]

jury trial right evaporates. See BMG Music v. Gonzalez, 430 F.3d 888 , 892-893 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that a copyright
infringement defendant was not entitled to a jury trial on the question of the amount of statutory damages where plaintiff had
only requested the statutory minimum); Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Frith, 645 F.2d 6 , 7 (5th Cir.1981) (holding that
defendants were not entitled to a jury trial in a copyright infringement action in which only statutory minimum damages and
injunctive relief were sought).

Should the Monastery elect to receive the minimum amount of statutory damages ($750 per work infringed), the court
is prepared to enter a money judgment in its favor for $5,250 (representing the total for infringement of the St. Isaac Work
and the six other Works), in addition to any appropriate injunctive relief. Whether to award attorneys' fees is a matter for the
court's discretion (with or without the involvement of a jury). See Fogerty v. Fantasy. Inc..510 U.S. 517 , 534,114 S.Ct.
1023 , 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994) .

ORDER

For the foregoing reasons, the Monastery's motion for summary judgment is ALLOWED as to liability on the outstanding
copyright infringement claims. The Monastery will notify the court on or before December 17, 2010, whether it is willing to
elect entry of a final judgment based on the minimum amount of statutory damages. Should the Monastery elect statutory
damages in excess of $750 per work infringed, trial on the damages issue will commence at 9:00 a.m. on January 18, 2011.

SO ORDERED.

4On February 18 2010. 685 F.Supp.2d 217 (D.Mass.2010) the court entered a Memorandum and Order on Cross—
Motions for Summary Judgment (Feb. 18, 2010 Mem. and Order) granting judgment to the Monastery on its breach of



--- Page 6 ---
contract claim and a claim of copyright infringement as to a seventh disputed text, the St. Isaac Work.

2.The Archbishop admits that he bears responsibility for and has authority over the content of the website. However,
he claims that he did not personally post the allegedly infringing material, and that he was unaware of the details of the
actual material being posted. Corr. Jt. Stmt. Mat. Undisp. Facts § 23, 137.

3.ROCOR is not a party to this lawsuit.

4 The Monastery has cataloged extensive examples of verbatim and near-verbatim similarities between the Works and
the texts that appeared on the Archbishop's website. See Pl.'s Summ. J. Mem. at 21-31; Pl.'s Reply Mem., App.

5 For example, regarding Psalm 3 of the Psalter Work, the Monastery's phrasing “without cause” has been replaced by
“vainly” in the Archbishop's corresponding website document. In addition, there are slight textual differences between
portions of the Monastery's Prayer Book Work and the corresponding text posted on the Archbishop's website (e.g., the
Archbishop changes “Friend of man” to “Lover of man” throughout the document). See Pl.'s Summ. J. Mem. at 21-31.

8 Moreover, the applicability of the DMCA safe harbor provisions to the Archbishop is questionable. See Pl.'s Reply
Mem. at 2-3 (“The Monastery disputes that the Defendant qualifies as an ISP or ‘service provider’ as the statute defines
these terms, and therefore disputes that the statute's Safe Harbor provisions insulate him. 17 U.S.C. § 512(k).”); see also
Quantum Sys. Integrators, Inc. v. Sprint Nextel Corp., 338 Fed.Appx. 329, 336 (4th Cir.2009) (distinguishing between an
ISP, which has no control over the content that its users upload to the Internet, and an employer, who is potentially liable for
employees’ acts of volitional copying).

Before: BECKER, ""NYGAARD, and AMBRO, Circuit Judges.
OPINION OF THE COURT
AMBRO, Circuit Judge.

In this copyright case we review the District Court's entry of a preliminary injunction against Video Pipeline, Inc.'s on-
line display of ""clip previews."" A ""clip preview,"" as we use the term, is an approximately two-minute segment of a movie,
copied without authorization from the film's copyright holder, and used in the same way as an authorized movie ""trailer."" We
reserve the term ""trailer"" for previews created by the copyright holder of a particular movie (or under the copyright holder's
authority).

Video Pipeline challenges the injunction on the ground that its internet use of the clip previews is protected by the fair
use doctrine and, alternatively, that appellees Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc. and Miramax Film Corp. ! may not
receive the benefits of copyright protection because they have engaged in copyright misuse. We reject both arguments, and
affirm.

BACKGROUND
Video Pipeline compiles movie trailers onto videotape for home video retailers to
Page 195

display in their stores. To obtain the right to distribute the trailers used in the compilations, Video Pipeline enters into
agreements with various entertainment companies. It entered into such an agreement, the Master Clip License Agreement
(""License Agreement""), with Disney in 1988, and Disney thereafter provided Video Pipeline with over 500 trailers for its
movies.

In 1997, Video Pipeline took its business to the web, where it operates VideoPipeline.net and VideoDetective.com. The
company maintains a database accessible from VideoPipeline.net, which contains movie trailers Video Pipeline has received
throughout the years. Video Pipeline's internet clients — retail web sites selling home videos — use VideoPipeline.net to
display trailers to site visitors. The site visitors access trailers by clicking on a button labeled ""preview"" for a particular motion
picture. The requested trailer is then ""streamed"" for the visitor to view (because it is streamed the trailer cannot be
downloaded to or stored on the visitor's computer). The operators of the web sites from which the trailers are accessed —


--- Page 2 ---
Video Pipeline's internet clients — pay a fee to have the trailers streamed based on the number of megabytes shown to site
visitors. Video Pipeline has agreements to stream trailers with approximately 25 online retailers, including Yahoo!, Amazon,
and Best Buy.

As noted, Video Pipeline also operates VideoDetective.com. On this web site, visitors can search for movies by title,
actor, scene, genre, etc. When a search is entered, the site returns a list of movies and information about them, and allows
he user to stream trailers from VideoPipeline.net. In addition to displaying trailers, VideoDetective.com includes a ""Shop
Now"" button to link the user to a web site selling the requested video. Visitors to VideoDetective.com can also win prizes by
playing ""Can You Name that Movie?"" after viewing a trailer on the site.

Video Pipeline included in its online database trailers it received under the License Agreement from Disney. Because
he License Agreement did not permit this use, Disney requested that Video Pipeline remove the trailers from the database.
It complied with that request.

On October 24, 2000, however, Video Pipeline filed a complaint in the District Court for the District of New Jersey
seeking a declaratory judgment that its online use of the trailers did not violate federal copyright law. Disney shortly
hereafter terminated the License Agreement.

Video Pipeline decided to replace some of the trailers it had removed at Disney's request from its database. In order to
do so, it copied approximately two minutes from each of at least 62 Disney movies to create its own clip previews of the
movies. (Again, to distinguish between the previews created under the copyright holder's authority and those created by
Video Pipeline, we call the former ""trailers"" and the latter ""clip previews"" or ""clips."" We use the term ""previews"" generically.)

Video Pipeline stores the clip previews in its database and displays them on the internet in the same way it had
displayed the Disney trailers. In content, however, the clip previews differ from the trailers. Each clip preview opens with a
display of the Miramax or Disney trademark and the title of the movie, then shows one or two scenes from the first half of
the movie, and closes with the title again. Disney's trailers, in contrast, are designed to entice sales from a target market by
using techniques such as voice-over, narration, editing, and additional music. Video Pipeline's

Page 196
clip previews use none of these marketing techniques. @

Disney also makes its trailers available online. It displays them on its own web sites in order to attract and to keep
users there (a concept called ""stickiness"") and then takes advantage of the users’ presence to advertise and sell other
products. Disney has also entered into agreements to link its trailers with other businesses, and, for example, has such a link
with the Apple Computer home page.

Video Pipeline amended its complaint to seek a declaratory judgment allowing it to use the clip previews. Disney filed a
counterclaim alleging copyright infringement. The District Court entered a preliminary injunction, later revised, prohibiting
Video Pipeline from displaying clip previews of Disney films on the internet. See Video Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista Home
Entertainment, Inc., 192 F.Supp.2d 321 (D.N.J.2002) . Video Pipeline appeals.

DISCUSSION

We review for an abuse of discretion the District Court's decision to grant Disney's request for a preliminary injunction.
Adams v. Freedom Forge Corp., 204 F.3d 475 , 484 (3d Cir.2000). Under this standard, questions of law receivede novo
review, and questions of fact are reviewed for clear error. /d.

To obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must show (1) that it is ""reasonably likely to succeed on the merits"" of its
copyright infringement claim and (2) a likelihood that it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied. /d. Other issues

to consider if relevant are (3) the likelihood of irreparable harm to the non-moving party and (4) the public interest. /d. Video
Pipeline presents no arguments for issues (3) and (4), so we shall not discuss them, assuming instead that the District Court
correctly held that these factors favored issuing the injunction. We therefore address the first two issues.

|. Likelihood of Success on the Merits

Subject to the fair use exception discussed below (and other exceptions not relevant here), copyright owners have the
exclusive right (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work, (2) to prepare derivative works, (3) to distribute copies, (4) to perform

Page 197

publicly a copyrighted motion picture, and (5) to display publicly the individual images of a copyrighted motion picture. 17
U.S.C. § 106. To make out a prima facie case of copyright infringement for preliminary injunction purposes, Disney needed
to show that the display of the clip previews likely violates any provision of § 106. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 501(a), (b). 4 The District
Court held that Video Pipeline's clip previews likely infringe Disney's exclusive rights under three of § 106's provisions:
subsection (2), concerning derivative works; subsection (4), dealing with public performance of motion pictures; and
subsection (5), relating to public display of individual images of a motion picture.

On appeal, Video Pipeline challenges the District Court's holding that the clip previews likely violate § 106(2), asserting


--- Page 3 ---
that the clips cannot properly be classified as derivative works. It does not contest the Court's determination as to
subsections (4) and (5). Because proof of a violation of any one subsection of § 106 states a case of illegal infringement, the
District Court's decision that Disney made a prima facie showing of infringement on the basis of subsections (4) and (5)
would not be affected by any conclusion we might make as to whether the clip previews are derivative in nature. As Video
Pipeline's display of excerpts taken from the copyrighted movies clearly comes within the prohibition on public display of
motion pictures, and images from a motion picture, we turn to whether Video Pipeline's use should nonetheless be
countenanced on the ground that it falls within the ""fair use"" doctrine.

A. Fair Use

Congress's constitutional power to provide for copyright protection ""is intended to motivate the creative activity of
authors... by the provision of a special reward, and to allow the public access to the products of their genius after the limited
period of exclusive control has expired."" Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 429, 104 S.Ct. 774
, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) . At times, however, ""rigid application of the copyright statute... would stifle the very creativity which
that law is designed to foster."" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.,510 U.S. 569 , 577,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994) . When that is the case, the fair use doctrine may be implicated.

Congress codified the judicially created ""fair use"" defense at § 107 of the 1976 Copyright Act, which permits a ""fair use
of a copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107. A fair use, although not specifically defined by the statute, is one made ""for

purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching ..., scholarship, or research."" /d. It is an affirmative defense
for which the alleged infringer bears the burden of proof.

In judging the fairness of a particular use, courts must take into account the following non-exhaustive list of factors:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

Page 198

Id. The four statutory factors ""do not represent a score card that promises victory to the winner of the majority."" Pierre N.
Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1110 (1990). Rather, each factor is ""to be explored, and the
results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citations
omitted). Thus, as we apply copyright law, and the fair use doctrine in particular, we bear in mind its purpose to encourage
""creative activity"" for the public good. Sony Corp., 464 U.S. at 429 , 104 S.Ct. 774.

This focus on copyright's purpose makes relevant a comparison of the copy with the original: where the copier uses
none of his own creative activity to transform the original work, holding the fair use doctrine inapplicable will not likely
interfere with copyright's goal of encouraging creativity. Thus, in the typical fair use case, the analysis under each statutory
factor concentrates on the copy and the original work from which it derives. In this case, however, our analysis of the four
statutory factors will take into account where relevant Disney's original full-length films and its trailers. We examine in this
way the fairness of the online display of the clip previews because, among other things, the statute directs our attention
under factor four to the effect of the allegedly infringing uses on both the potential market for any derivative works (the
parties do not dispute that Disney's trailers qualify as derivative works) and the potential market for the originals. See
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 .

1. Purpose and Character of the Use

Once again, the first factor requires that we consider ""the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use
is of acommercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes."" § 107(1). The District Court concluded that the purpose
and character of Video Pipeline's clip previews weigh against finding fair use. We agree.

If a new work is used commercially rather than for a nonprofit purpose, its use will less likely qualify as fair. Campbell,
510 U.S. at 585 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . As Video Pipeline charges a fee to stream the clip previews, its use of the copies is
commercial (as the District Court found).

The commercial nature of the use does not by itself, however, determine whether the purpose and character of the use

weigh for or against finding fair use. /d. at 583-84, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . We look as well to any differences in character and
purpose between the new use and the original. We consider whether the copy is ""transformative"" of the work it copied
because it ""alter[ed] the first with new expression, meaning, or message,"" or instead ""whether the new work merely

supersedes the objects of the original creation."" /d. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citations and alteration in original omitted).

Video Pipeline asserts that its use of the clip previews substantially transforms the full-length films from which they
derive because the clips and the movies have different purposes. According to Video Pipeline, the original works have an



--- Page 4 ---
aesthetic and entertainment purpose while the clip previews serve only to provide information about the movies to internet
users or as advertisements for the company's retail web site clients. 5 To the extent

Page 199

hat the character and purpose of the clip previews and the original full-length films diverge, however, the clips share the
same character and purpose as Disney's derivative trailers. Whatever informational or promotional character and purpose
he trailers possess, so do the clip previews. Consequently, the clips are likely to ""supersede the objects of"" Disney's
derivatives. Campbell,510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citations omitted). ® Although the clips are copied from Disney's
original rather than its derivative works, it is highly relevant to our inquiry here that the clips will likely serve as substitutes for
hose derivatives.

Video Pipeline also urges us to take into account the functional character and purpose of the database in which it stores
railers and clip previews, apparently hoping we will discern no significant difference between its database and the internet

search engine used in Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.. 336 F.3d 811 (9th Cir.2003) .7 In Kelly, Arriba Soft Corp.'s search engine
located images on other web sites in response to a user's request and displayed the results in thumbnail-size pictures, with

a link that would take the user to the web site on which the image was found. /d. at 815. The Court held that the display of
he thumbnail images was a fair use. /d.

Video Pipeline's database does not, however, serve the same function as did Arriba Soft's search engine. As used with
retailers' web sites, VideoPipeline.net does not improve access to authorized previews located on other web sites. Rather, it
indexes and displays unauthorized copies of copyrighted works. VideoDetective.com does permit viewers to link to
legitimate retailers' web sites, but a link to a legitimate seller of authorized copies does not here, if it ever would, make prima
facie infringement a fair use.

Finally, we note that Video Pipeline's clip previews — to reiterate, approximately two-minute excerpts of full-length films
with movie title and company trademark shown — do not add significantly to Disney's original expression. Video Pipeline
itself asserts, and the District Court found, 192 F.Supp.2d at 337 , that the clip previews

Page 200

""involved no new creative ingenuity."" The Court did recognize that deciding which scene or scenes to include in a clip
preview requires some creative choice. /d. But as Video Pipeline disclaims the use of any creative ingenuity, we have no
difficulty viewing those decisions as involving creativity only in a theoretical, and most narrow, sense. Hence, it is dubious
what ""new expression, meaning, or message"" Video Pipeline has brought to its copies. Campbell,_510 U.S. at 579 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 .

It is useful to compare the clip previews with a movie review, which might also display two-minute segments copied
from a film. The movie reviewer does not simply display a scene from the movie under review but as well provides his or her
own commentary and criticism. In so doing, the critic may add to the copy sufficient ""new expression, message, or meaning""
to render the use fair. /d. Here, in contrast, the fact that ""a substantial portion,"" indeed almost all, ""of the infringing work was
copied verbatim from the copyrighted work"" with no additional creative activity ""reveal[s] a dearth of transformative character
or purpose."" /d. at 587, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Consequently, rejecting the fair use defense in this case will not likely ""stifle the
very creativity"" that the Copyright Clause ""is designed to foster."" /d. at 577, 114 S.Ct. 1164.

With this context, the District Court correctly concluded that Video Pipeline's clip previews lack any significant
transformative quality. Thus, the commercial nature of the clip previews weighs more strongly against Video Pipeline's use.
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 580 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (If ""the alleged infringer merely uses [the original work] to get attention or to
avoid the drudgery in working up something fresh, the claim to fairness in borrowing from another's work diminishes
accordingly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like the extent of its commerciality, loom larger.""). Given the shared
character and purpose of the clip previews and the trailers (so that the clips will likely serve as a substitute for the trailers)
and the absence of creative ingenuity in the creation of the clips, the first factor strongly weighs against fair use in this case.

2. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second statutory fair use factor directs courts to consider ""the nature of the copyrighted work."" § 107(2). ""This
factor calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with the

consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 . Fictional, creative works come closer to this core than do primarily factual works Harper & Row Publishers, Inc.
v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539 , 563, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . The Disney movies at issue — including, for
example, Beauty and the Beast, Fantasia, Pretty Woman, and Dead Poet's Society — are paradigms of creative, non-factual
expression. And Disney's trailers share imaginative aspects with the originals.

Video Pipeline argues that this factor nonetheless weighs in its favor because Disney released to the public its movies,
if not all of its trailers, prior to Video Pipeline's display of the clip previews. ® It is true that Disney would have a stronger case
against fair use had it not yet made its movies available for the public's viewing pleasure. See id. at 554, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (""
[T]he unpublished nature of a work is a key ... factor tending to negate a defense


--- Page 5 ---
Page 201
of fair use."") (quoting S.Rep. No. 94-473 at 64 (1975)) (alteration and quotation marks in original omitted).

But the second statutory factor does not necessarily weigh in favor of finding fair use simply because the public already
has access to the original work. Rather, that Disney's movies and trailers contain mainly creative expression, not factual
material, suggests that the use is not fair regardless of the published or unpublished status of the original. See e.g.,
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (holding that the song Pretty Woman fit ""within the core of the copyright's
protective purposes"" because of its creative expression, without considering that the original had already been made
available to the public). The District Court therefore properly relied on the creative, non-factual expression involved in
Disney's movies and trailers to hold that this factor weighs against the fair use defense.

3. Amount and Substantiality of the Work Copied

The third factor requires an analysis of ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole."" § 107(3). The District Court determined that this factor also weighed in Disney's favor. 192 F.Supp.2d at
340.

As Video Pipeline points out, its previews excerpt only about two minutes from movies that last one and a half to two
hours. Quantitatively then, the portion taken is quite small.

But the third factor ""calls for thought not only about the quantity of the materials used, but about their quality and
importance, too."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 587 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The District Court found that the clip previews, ""for the most
part, were used to provide the potential customer with some idea of the plot of each motion picture, its overall tone, and a
glimpse of its leading characters."" 192 F.Supp.2d at 339 . Although the plot, tone, and leading characters are, of course,
significant aspects of the films, the two-minute ""glimpse"" provided by the clips is made up only of scenes taken from the first
half of the Disney films. Disney has not claimed, for instance, that any of the clips ""give away"" the ending of a movie, or ruin
other intended surprises for viewers of the full-length films. Moreover, as advertisements, the clip previews are meant to
whet the customer's appetite, not to sate it; accordingly, they are not designed to reveal the ""heart"" of the movies. Simply
put, we have no reason to believe that the two-minute clips manage in so brief a time, or even intend, to appropriate the
""heart"" of the movies. Compare Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564-55 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (weighing this factor against finding fair
use because the alleged infringer ""took what was essentially the heart of the book"").

Because the clip previews copy a relatively small amount of the original full-length films and do not go to the ""heart"" of
the movies, this factor, contrary to the District Court's determination, weighs in favor of finding fair Video Pipeline's display of
its clips.

4. Effect on Potential Market or Value

Finally, courts should evaluate ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" §
107(4). The District Court considered the question to be whether Video Pipeline's ""use of the copyrighted work affects or
materially impairs the marketability of the copyrighted motion pictures,"" and, finding the evidence equivocal, concluded that
the fourth factor weighed neither for nor against finding a likelihood of fair use. 192 F.Supp.2d at 340 , 343.

Page 202

As mentioned above, this final factor ""must take [into] account not only ... harm to the original but also ... harm to the
market for derivative works."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Because the issues pertaining to the potential
harm to the market for Disney's derivative trailers are more straightforward, we focus our analysis on this area and do not
review the District Court's conclusion as to harm to the market for the original full-length films. 9 It is in this context that we
conclude that the fourth factor weighs in Disney's favor.

Video Pipeline argued in the District Court that no market exists, or could exist, for movie previews because no one
""ever paid or will ever pay any money merely to see trailers."" But in fact retail websites are paying Video Pipeline to display
both trailers and clip previews. Moreover, Video Pipeline takes too narrow a view of the harm contemplated by this fourth
factor. The statute directs us to consider ""the effect of the use upon the. . . value of the copyrighted work,"" not only the effect
upon the ""market,"" however narrowly that term is defined. § 107(4); see also Worldwide Church of God v. Philadelphia
Church of God, Inc., 227 F.3d 1110 , 1119 (9th Cir.2000) (drawing such a distinction). And the value ""need not be limited to
monetary rewards; compensation may take a variety of forms."" /d.; see also Sony Corp., 464 U.S. at 447 n. 28, 104 S.Ct.
774 (stating in a different context that the ""copyright law does not require a copyright owner to charge a fee for the use of his
works, and ... the owner of a copyright may well have economic or noneconomic reasons for permitting certain kinds of
copying to occur without receiving direct compensation from the copier"").

Disney introduced evidence that it has entered an agreement to cross-link its trailers with the Apple Computer home
page and that it uses on its own websites ""the draw of the availability of authentic trailers to advertise, cross-market and

cross-sell other products, and to obtain valuable marketing information from visitors who chose [ sic] to register at the site or

make a purchase there."" App. 945; see also Kelly, 336 F.3d at 821 (""Kelly's images are related to several potential markets.
One purpose of the photographs is to attract internet users to his web site, where he sells advertising space as well as


--- Page 6 ---
books and travel packages. In addition, Kelly could sell or license his photographs to other web sites or to a stock photo
database, which then could offer the images to its customers.""). In light of Video Pipeline's commercial use of the clip
previews and Disney's use of its trailers as described by the record evidence, we easily conclude that there is a sufficient
market for, or other value in, movie previews such that the use of an infringing work could have a harmful effect cognizable
under the fourth factor.

We have already determined that the clip previews lack transformative quality and that, though the clips are copies
taken directly from the original full-length films rather than from the trailers, display of the clip previews would substitute for
the derivative works. As a result, the clips, if Video Pipeline continues to stream them over the internet, will ""serve[] as a
market replacement"" for the trailers, ""making it

Page 203

likely that cognizable market harm to the [derivatives] will occur."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . For instance,
web sites wishing to show previews of Disney movies may choose to enter licensing agreements with Video Pipeline rather
than Disney, as at least 25 have already done. And internet users searching for previews of Disney films may be drawn by
the clip previews to web sites other than Disney's, depriving Disney of the opportunity to advertise and sell other products to
those users. 1°

Consequently, ""unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by [Video Pipeline] . . . would result ina
substantially adverse impact on the potential market’ for the [derivative works]."" /d. at 590, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting 3 M.

Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 13.05(A)(4) (1993)). We therefore hold that the District Court should have
weighed this factor against recognizing the fair use defense in this case.

kk K RK

Three of the four statutory factors indicate that Video Pipeline's internet display of the clip previews will not qualify as a
fair use. From our consideration of each of those factors, we cannot conclude that Video Pipeline's online display of its clip
previews does anything but ""infringe[] a work for personal profit."" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 563 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . The
District Court therefore correctly held that Video Pipeline has failed to show that it will likely prevail on its fair use defense.

B. Copyright Misuse

Video Pipeline further contends that Disney has misused its copyright and, as a result, should not receive the protection
of copyright law. Video Pipeline points to certain licensing agreements that Disney has entered into with three companies
and sought to enter into with a number of other companies operating web sites. '' Each of these licensing agreements
provides that Disney, the licensor, will deliver trailers by way of hyperlinks '? for display on the licensee's web site. The
Agreements further state:

The Website in which the Trailers are used may not be derogatory to or critical of the entertainment industry or of
[Disney] (and its officers, directors, agents, employees, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries) or of any motion picture
produced or distributed by [Disney]... [or] of the materials from which the Trailers were taken or of any person involved with
the production of the Underlying Works. Any breach of this paragraph will render this license null and void and Licensee will
be liable to all parties concerned for defamation and copyright infringement, as well as breach of contract....

As Video Pipeline sees it, such licensing agreements seek to use copyright law to suppress criticism and, in so doing,
misuse those laws, triggering the copyright misuse doctrine.

Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has affirmatively recognized the copyright misuse doctrine. See Dun &
Bradstreet Software Servs., Inc. v. Grace Consulting, Inc., 307 F.3d 197 , 221 (3d

Page 204

Cir.2002). There is, however, a well-established patent misuse doctrine, see, e.g., Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co., 314
U.S. 488 , 62 S.Ct. 402 , 86 L.Ed. 363 (1942) ; W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc. v. Carlisle Corp., 529 F.2d 614 (3d Cir.1976) , and,
as noted below, other courts of appeals have extended the doctrine to the copyright context.

The misuse doctrine extends from the equitable principle that courts ""may appropriately withhold their aid where the
plaintiff is using the right asserted contrary to the public interest."" Morton Salt,314 U.S. at 492 , 62 S.Ct. 402 . Misuse is not
cause to invalidate the copyright or patent, but instead ""precludes its enforcement during the period of misuse."" Practice
Management Info. Corp. v. American Med. Assoc., 121 F.3d 516 , 520 n. 9 (9th Cir.1997) (citingLasercomb America. Inc. v.
Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970 , 979 n.22 (4th Cir.1990)). To defend on misuse grounds, the alleged infringer need not be subject
to the purported misuse. Morton Salt,314 U.S. at 494 , 62 S.Ct. 402 (""It is the adverse effect upon the public interest of a
successful infringement suit in conjunction with the patentee's course of conduct which disqualifies him to maintain the suit,
regardless of whether the particular defendant has suffered from the misuse of the patent.""); Lasercomb, 911 F.2d at 979 (""
[T]he fact that appellants here were not parties to one of Lasercomb's standard license agreements is inapposite to their
copyright misuse defense. The question is whether Lasercomb is using its copyright in a manner contrary to public policy,
which question we have answered in the affirmative."").



--- Page 7 ---
Misuse often exists where the patent or copyright holder has engaged in some form of anti-competitive behavior. See,
e.g., Morton Salt,_314 U.S. at 492 , 62 S.Ct. 402 (explaining that public policy ""forbids the use of the patent to secure an
exclusive right or limited monopoly not granted by the Patent Office""); Practice Management, 121 F.3d at 521 (finding
copyright misuse where license to use copyrighted good prohibited licensee from using competing goods); Lasercomb, 911
F.2d at 979 (holding the copyright holder misused its copyright by including in licensing agreements a provision that neither
the licensee company nor its officers, employees, et a/., could develop competing goods for the term of the agreement,
ninety-nine years). More on point, however, is the underlying policy rationale for the misuse doctrine set out in the
Constitution's Copyright and Patent Clause: ""to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts."" Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 8;
see also Morton Salt,314 U.S. at 494 , 62 S.Ct. 402 (""The patentee, like these other holders of an exclusive privilege
granted in furtherance of a public policy [trademark and copyright holders], may not claim protection of his grant by the
courts where it is being used to subvert that policy.""); Lasercomb,_911 F.2d at 978 (""The question is ... whether the copyright
is being used in a manner violative of the public policy embodied in the grant of a copyright.""). The ""ultimate aim"" of
copyright law is ""to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good."" Sony Corp., 464 U.S. at 432 , 104 S.Ct. 774 ; see
also Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186 , 123 S.Ct. 769 , 787, 154 L.Ed.2d 683 (2003) (""[C]opyright's purpose is to promote the
creation and publication of free expression."") (emphasis in original). Put simply, our Constitution emphasizes the purpose
and value of copyrights and patents. Harm caused by their misuse undermines their usefulness.

Anti-competitive licensing agreements may conflict with the purpose behind a copyright's protection by depriving the
public of the would-be competitor's creativity.

Page 205

The fair use doctrine and the refusal to copyright facts and ideas also address applications of copyright protection that would
otherwise conflict with a copyright's constitutional goal. See Eldred, 123 S.Ct. at 789 ; Campbell,_510 U.S. at 575 & n. 5, 114
S.Ct. 1164 . But it is possible that a copyright holder could leverage its copyright to restrain the creative expression of
another without engaging in anti-competitive behavior or implicating the fair use and idea/expression doctrines. 13

For instance, the concurring opinion, written for a majority of the judges, in Rosemont Enters., Inc. v. Random House
Inc., 366 F.2d 303 (2d Cir.1966) , concluded that pursuant to the unclean hands doctrine the District Court should not have
entered a preliminary injunction against an alleged copyright infringer where the copyright holder sought to use his copyright
""to restrict the dissemination of information."" /d. at 311 (Lumbard, C.J., concurring). In Rosemont Enters., a corporation
acting for the publicity-shy Howard Hughes purchased the copyright to an article about Hughes solely to bring an
infringement suit to enjoin the publication of a forthcoming biography on Hughes. /d. at 313. The concurring opinion
reasoned:

The spirit of the First Amendment applies to the copyright laws at least to the extent that the courts should not tolerate
any attempted interference with the public's right to be informed regarding matters of general interest when anyone seeks to
use the copyright statute which was designed to protect interests of quite a different nature.

Id. at 311; see also Eldred, 123 S.Ct. at 790 n. 24 (""[l]t is appropriate to construe copyright's internal safeguards to
accommodate First Amendment concerns."").

Although Rosemont Enters. did not concern an anti-competitive licensing agreement as in the typical misuse case, it
focused — as do the misuse cases — on the copyright holder's attempt to disrupt a copyright's goal to increase the store of
creative expression for the public good. 366 F.2d at 311 (""It would be contrary to the public interest to permit any man to buy
up the copyright to anything written about himself and to use his copyright ownership to restrain other[s] from publishing
biographical material concerning him.""); Lasercomb,_911 F.2d at 978 (""[T]he company is required to forego utilization of the
creative abilities of all its officers, directors and employees in the area of [computer assisted design and computer assisted
manufacture] die-making software. Of yet greater concern, these creative abilities are withdrawn from the public.""). A
copyright holder's attempt to restrict expression that is critical of it (or of its copyrighted good, or the industry in which it

Page 206

operates, etc. ) may, in context, subvert — as do anti-competitive restrictions — a copyright's policy goal to encourage the
creation and dissemination to the public of creative activity.

The licensing agreements in this case do seek to restrict expression by licensing the Disney trailers for use on the
internet only so long as the web sites on which the trailers will appear do not derogate Disney, the entertainment industry,
etc. But we nonetheless cannot conclude on this record that the agreements are likely to interfere with creative expression to
such a degree that they affect in any significant way the policy interest in increasing the public store of creative activity. The
licensing agreements do not, for instance, interfere with the licensee's opportunity to express such criticism on other web
sites or elsewhere. There is no evidence that the public will find it any more difficult to obtain criticism of Disney and its
interests, or even that the public is considerably less likely to come across this criticism, if it is not displayed on the same
site as the trailers. Moreover, if a critic wishes to comment on Disney's works, the fair use doctrine may be implicated
regardless of the existence of the licensing agreements. Finally, copyright law, and the misuse doctrine in particular, should
not be interpreted to require Disney, if it licenses its trailers for display on any web sites but its own, to do so willy-nilly
regardless of the content displayed with its copyrighted works. Indeed such an application of the misuse doctrine would


--- Page 8 ---
likely decrease the public's access to Disney's works because it might as a result refuse to license at all online display of its
works.

Thus, while we extend the patent misuse doctrine to copyright, and recognize that it might operate beyond its traditional
anti-competition context, we hold it inapplicable here. On this record Disney's licensing agreements do not interfere
significantly with copyright policy (while holding to the contrary might, in fact, do so). The District Court therefore correctly
held that Video Pipeline will not likely succeed on its copyright misuse defense.

Il. Irreparable Harm

On the basis of Disney's prima facie infringement case and its likelihood of success against Video Pipeline's asserted
defenses, the District Court presumed Disney would suffer irreparable injury if a preliminary injunction did not issue.
Generally, ""a showing of a prima facie case of copyright infringement or reasonable likelihood of success on the merits
raises a presumption of irreparable harm."" Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240 , 1254 (3d
Cir.1983).

When, however, ""material peripheral to the [copyright holder's] business has been infringed,"" we ""require a stronger
showing of irreparable harm as the [copyright holder's] likelihood of success on the merits wanes."" Marco v. Accent Publ'g
Co., 969 F.2d 1547 , 1553 (3d Cir. 1992). Video Pipeline has likely infringed Disney's movies, which are certainly more than
peripheral to its business. Even if we were to consider here (as we did under the fourth fair use factor) that the likely market
harm will be to the derivative market for trailers rather than to the market for the full-length features, and that the trailer
market may be only peripheral to Disney's business, Disney has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits, and so
need not make a particularly strong showing of irreparable harm.

Regardless, the record indicates that Disney will likely incur incalculable losses from the clip previews' competition with
the trailers — especially in terms of internet users' attraction to (and the ""stickiness"" of) Disney's and others' web sites

Page 207

and the concomitant opportunities for sales and marketing on those sites. Disney will therefore likely suffer irreparable harm
if Video Pipeline is not enjoined. Moreover, given the verbatim copying, lack of creative ingenuity, and profit-driven purpose
of the clip previews, we have no concern that this case is one in which the creative and expressive goals of copyright law
would be served better by denying an injunction. See Campbell,_510 U.S. at 578 n.10, 114 S.Ct. 1164 .

CONCLUSION

The District Court correctly held that Disney will likely succeed on the merits of its copyright infringement case, given its
prima facie showing and that Video Pipeline's attempts to defend on fair use and copyright misuse grounds will likely fail.
The Court's conclusion as to irreparable harm was also correct. We therefore affirm the entry of the preliminary injunction
prohibiting Video Pipeline from displaying its clip previews on the internet.

Notes:
* Judge Becker concluded his term as Chief Judge on May 4, 2003.

1. Buena Vista holds an exclusive license to distribute Miramax and Walt Disney Pictures and Television home videos. Buena Vista, Miramax, and Walt
Disney Pictures and Television are subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Co. Because of this connection and for simplicity's sake, we refer to the appellees
collectively and individually as ""Disney.""

2. We have reviewed as part of the record several of the clip previews and trailers.

3. The District Court's jurisdiction arose under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1338. We have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).

On August 7, 2008, the District Court entered summary judgment in Disney's favor as to various claims and counterclaims, some of which overlap
with what is before us. See Video Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc., 2003 WL 21811891 (D.N.J. Aug.7, 2003). The obvious question
is whether this appeal is moot. We have concluded, however, that a live controversy remains because the District Court has not entered a final judgment
or a permanent injunction in place of the preliminary one and has not otherwise revoked or altered the injunction on appeal. See generally Grupo
Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308 , 313-18, 119 S.Ct. 1961 , 144 L.Ed.2d 319 (1999) .

4. There is no dispute as to Disney's copyright ownership in the full-length motion pictures at issue.

5. We note that the clip previews do not constitute mere ""information"" about the movies, as would, for example, a list of the names of the actors starring
in a film, or a statement of the rating it received. Were Video Pipeline dealing only in this type of information, the fair use doctrine might not be implicated
at all because copyright protection does not include facts and ideas, but only their expression. See Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471
U.S. 539 , 547, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) ; 17 U.S.C. § 102(b). Regardless, the clips are part of — not information about — Disney's
expressive creations. See id. at 569, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (""Any copyright infringer may claim to benefit the public by increasing public access to the
copyrighted work."").

Additionally, it is not clear to us that the use of a copy — not accompanied by any creative expression on the part of the copier — as an
advertisement for the original would qualify as a type of use intended to be recognized by the fair use doctrine. See Campbell,_510 U.S. at 578-79 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 (""The enquiry [under the first factor] may be guided by the examples given in the preamble to § 107, looking to whether the use is for
criticism, or comment, or news reporting, and the like. . . .""); id. at 585, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (""The use, for example, of a copyrighted work to advertise a


--- Page 9 ---
product, even in a parody, will be entitled to less indulgence under the first factor of the fair use enquiry than the sale of a parody for its own sake, let
alone one performed a single time by students in school."").

We need not resolve these issues, however, because (as we conclude in the text) the purpose and character of the use of the clip previews and that
of Disney's derivative works — its trailers — are the same.

6. We see little significance in whether the trailers use marketing techniques that the clip previews do not.

7. A database is a discrete collection of data (here, previews) set up for efficient retrieval. By comparison, a search engine refers to a system that locates

data (or images, etc. ) from other web sites; thus, a search engine will retrieve data that is not in the engine operator's control. VideoPipeline.net is a
database, not a search engine.

8. The record does suggest that Video Pipeline streamed over the internet clip previews of some Disney movies not yet released to the public.

9. The District Court declined to consider the potential harm to the market for derivatives on the ground that Disney had not argued the issue. Disney did,
however, so argue in both its briefs in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction, and it submitted evidence to support those arguments. Video
Pipeline also responded in the District Court to the merits of Disney's arguments concerning potential harm to the market for its derivative works.
Consequently, Video Pipeline suffers no harm by our addressing this issue.

10. Record evidence indicates that clip previews were streamed over the internet more than 30,000 times between November 2000 and April 2001.

11. The record contains three signed licensing agreements and numerous letters sent by Disney to other companies asking them to sign the same
agreement.

12. A hyperlink allows an internet user to connect to another web site.

13. See Note, Clarifying the Copyright Misuse Defense: The Role of Antitrust Standards and First Amendment Values, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1289, 1304-06
(1991) (advocating application of the copyright misuse defense where ""the plaintiff has improperly used its copyright power to restrain free trade in
ideas,"" and explaining: ""The copyright misuse defense provides a necessary complement to the idea/expression dichotomy [under which an author's
expression may be copyrighted, but an idea may not] and fair use doctrine in vindicating the public interest in the dissemination of ideas. The
idea/expression limitation merely restricts the scope of the particular copyright being sued upon, and absent a claim of misuse, it cannot be brought to
bear on improper licensing restrictions or other misconduct. As with the misuse defense, fair use doctrine excuses copying that would otherwise be
infringement in order to vindicate the copyright policy promoting the diffusion of ideas. Unlike misuse doctrine, however, the fair use inquiry directs courts’
attention to the social value of the defendant's conduct rather than the social harm caused by the plaintiff's use of its copyright."").

Before LUMBARD, MANSFIELD and VAN GRAAFEILAND, Circuit Judges.

VAN GRAAFEILAND, Circuit Judge:

From January 1974 until July 1976, a show called ""Let My People Come"" was performed at the Village Gate, a cabaret
in the Greenwich Village section of New York City. Thereafter, it had short runs in several other cabarets and legitimate
theaters. The producers, perhaps wisely, refrained from seeking reviews by established theater critics. However, columnists
who viewed the production described it, among other things, as an ""erotic nude show"" with ""sex content raunchy enough to
satisfy the most jaded porno palate"", a show whose ""main concern is not fornication but fellatio and cunnilingus.""

The music in the show was said by one columnist to sound ""like something we've heard before but definitely not with
these

Page 182

words."" One of the songs, described by reporters as a ""take-off"" on the Andrew Sisters' and Bette Midler's renditions of a
copyrighted song called ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" is the subject of this litigation. Following a non-jury trial before Judge
Cooper in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, MCA, Inc., the copyright owner, was
awarded a total of $324,955.00 against various participants in the theatrical venture for infringement of the copyright on this
song. Judge Cooper's opinion is reported in 425 F.Supp. at 443 , and familiarity with it is assumed.

Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy is the alliterative description of a soldier in ""Company B"" who hailed from Chicago. During
early rehearsals for Let My People Come, defendant Wilson played for the cast a rough version of a song he had composed
which alliteratively described the ""Cunnilingus Champion of Company C"" who came from Memphis or maybe St. Joe. As
Judge Cooper found, cast members immediately commented concerning the similarities between the two songs. 425
F.Supp. at 448 . Because it was felt that the similarities would create publicity, they were not eliminated; indeed, to some
extent, they appear to have been fostered. Id. Our review of the testimony, lay and expert, and the visual and aural
impressions we have gained from the songs themselves satisfy us that the district court's factual finding of substantial
similarity was not clearly erroneous. See Ideal Toy Corp. v. Fab-Lu Ltd., 360 F.2d 1021 , 1022 (2d Cir. 1966); Fed.R.Civ.P.
52(a). Unless, therefore, defendants’ incorporation of the song into their show constituted fair use under the copyright law,
plaintiff has established its claim of copyright infringement.

In asserting the defense of fair use, defendants contend that they were using plaintiff's copyrighted song in a
reasonable manner and that therefore they were not required to secure plaintiff's consent. See Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., 604 F.2d 200 , 205-06 (2d Cir. 1979);Time. Inc. v. Bernard Geis Associates.
293 F.Supp. 130 , 144 (S.D.N.Y.1968). When weighing the merits of a defense such as this, a court does not have the
benefit of either a statutory or judicial definition of what is reasonable and fair. It has instead certain suggested criteria to
which it may look in making this determination.

Section 101 of the 1976 Copyright Act Revisions, 17 U.S.C. § 107, which, although not controlling herein, is intended to
be a codification of preexisting law, see Meeropol v. Nizer, 560 F.2d 1061 , 1068-69 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied,434 U.S.
1013 , 98 S.Ct. 727 , 54 L.Ed.2d 756 (1978) , provides in part that the ""fair use of a copyrighted work ... for purposes such as



--- Page 2 ---
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, ... scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright."" The statute
then sets forth four factors to be considered in determining whether a particular use is fair.

The court should, for example, look at the nature of the copyrighted work. In so doing, the court may consider, among
other things, whether the work was creative, imaginative, and original, New York Times Co. v. Roxbury Data Interface, Inc.,
434 F.Supp. 217 , 221 (D.N.J.1977), and whether it represented a substantial investment of time and labor made in
anticipation of a financial return, Wainwright Securities Inc. v. Wall Street Transcript Corp., 558 F.2d 91 , 96 (2d Cir. 1977),
cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014 , 98 S.Ct. 730 , 54 L.Ed.2d 759 (1978) .

The court should also look at the purpose and character of the alleged infringing use, including its commercial or non-
profit educational motivation or design. While commercial motivation and fair use can exist side by side, the court may
consider whether the alleged infringing use was primarily for public benefit or for private commercial gain. Meeropol v. Nizer,
supra, 560 F.2d at 1069 ; Rosemont Enterprises. Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 366 F.2d 303 , 307 (2d Cir. 1966), cert.
denied, 385 U.S. 1009 , 87 S.Ct. 714 , 17 L.Ed.2d 546 (1967) ; Marvin Worth Productions v. Superior Films Corp., 319
F.Supp. 1269 , 1275 (S.D.N.Y.1970).

Page 183

The court may also consider whether the paraphrasing and copying was done in good faith or with evasive motive. Roy
Export Company Establishment of Vaduz, Liechtenstein, Black, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 503 F.Supp.
1137 , 1146-47 (S.D.N.Y.1980); Nutt v. National Institute Incorporated for the Improvement of Memory, 31 F.2d 236 , 237
(2d Cir. 1929).

The third factor concerns the extent of the copying. Use of copyrighted material without the owner's consent generally
will not be considered reasonable if it extensively copies or paraphrases the original or bodily appropriates the research
upon which the original was based. Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., supra, 366 F.2d at 310 ; Walt
Disney Productions v. Mature Pictures Corp., 389 F.Supp. 1397 , 1398 (S.D.N.Y.1975); see Walt Disney Productions v. Air
Pirates, 581 F.2d 751 , 756 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied,439 U.S. 1132 , 99 S.Ct. 1054 , 59 L.Ed.2d 94 (1979) ; Universal
City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp. of America, 480 F.Supp. 429 , 454 (C.D.Cal.1979).

The final suggested factor concerns the effect of the alleged infringing use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work. The aim of the copyright laws is to stimulate artistic creativity for the benefit of the public, and this is done
by providing the artist with the financial motivation for creativity that flows from a limited form of monopoly. Twentieth Century
Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151 , 156, 95 S.Ct. 2040 2044, 45 L.Ed.2d 84 (1975) ; Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists
Television, Inc., 392 U.S. 390 , 393-95, 88 S.Ct. 2084 , 2085-2086, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176 (1968) . However, where a claim of fair
use is made, a balance must sometimes be struck between the benefit the public will derive if the use is permitted and the
personal gain the copyright owner will receive if the use is denied. Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States. 487 F.2d 1345 ,
1352 (Ct.Cl.1973), aff'd per curiam by an equally divided court, 420 U.S. 376 , 95 S.Ct. 1344 , 43 L.Ed.2d 264 (1975) ; Berlin
v. E. C. Publications, Inc., 329 F.2d 541 , 543-44 (2d Cir.), cert. denied,379 U.S. 822 , 85 S.Ct. 46 , 13 L.Ed.2d 33 (1964) .
The less adverse effect that an alleged infringing use has on the copyright owner's expectation of gain, the less public
benefit need be shown to justify the use. See Meeropol v. Nizer, supra, 560 F.2d at 1070 ; Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National
Broadcasting Co., 482 F.Supp. 741 , 747 (S.D.N.Y.), afftd,623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1980) (per curiam); Time, Inc. v. Bernard
Geis Associates, supra, 293 F.Supp. at 146 .

Using the above factors as guideposts, we may now review the evidence to determine whether the district court's
rejection of the fair use defense was clearly erroneous. Since the issue of fair use is one of fact, Meeropol v. Nizer, supra,
560 F.2d at 1068 ; Eisenschiml v. Fawcett Publications. Inc. 246 F.2d 598 , 604 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 907 , 78
S.Ct. 334 , 2 L.Ed.2d 262 (1957) , the clearly erroneous standard of review is appropriate.

Among the exhibits introduced below were two phonograph records. One, published by MCA Records, was an Andrews
Sisters’ recording which included Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy. The other, published by the defendant Libra, was a recording of
Let My People Come which included Cunnilingus Champion. The parties stipulated that the sale of these records was a
traditional means of exploiting musical works. Other stipulated means were the use of the songs in stage performances and
the sale of printed copies. Both of the songs at issue herein were exploited in all three media. In determining, therefore,
whether defendants’ use of plaintiff's song was unfair, we start from the premise that the songs were competing works.

When this action was commenced in July 1974, defendants did not contend that they were making fair use of plaintiff's
song. Instead, they simply denied plaintiff's allegation that Cunnilingus Champion was substantially copied from plaintiff's
copyrighted work. It was more than a year later, after plaintiff had amended its complaint to claim common law copyright
infringement of the Andrews Sisters’ recording of Boogie

Page 184

Woogie Bugle Boy, that defendants first pleaded a fair use defense. The record is not at all clear, however, as to when this
claim of fair use came into being.

In their Rule 16 pretrial stipulation of undisputed facts, the parties agreed that, when defendant Wilson played
Cunnilingus Champion for the first time at a cast rehearsal in early November 1973, some of the cast members told him they
thought it was similar to Bugle Boy. Wilson and defendant Oesterman, the producer-director of the show, then discussed
with cast members the possibility of being sued because of the similarity. Wilson and Oesterman decided to proceed with


--- Page 3 ---
Cunnilingus Champion because they concluded it was not the same as Bugle Boy. The parties further stipulated that, when
Cunnilingus Champion was written, it was not intended to make any statement about Bugle Boy or to parody Bugle Boy in
the sense of taking it out of context and holding it up to ridicule.

At trial, defendant Wilson testified that, at the time he wrote Cunnilingus Champion, he did not intend it to be either a
burlesque or a satire. He stated that, sometime during the rehearsals that followed the song's unveiling, he formed the intent
that the song would be a burlesque of the music of the 1940's. It is quite obvious, of course, that the words ""Cunnilingus
Champion of Company C"", as used in the title and throughout the lyrics of Wilson's song, were not a take-off on the music of
the '40's but on plaintiff's song alone. It is not surprising, therefore, that Wilson testified that, when his song finally was
performed on stage, he then intended it to be a spoof of Bugle Boy. Expanding on this point in his brief, Wilson states:

The parallelism of titles along makes it obvious that Appellant's work in some way refers to Appellee's work and, as a
burlesque, that is precisely its intention.

Defendants’ argument in short is that, because Cunnilingus Champion ""deals with the humorous practice of
cunnilingus"" and Wilson was trying to portray that practice as ""joyous"", he was entitled to use a competing copyright owner's
music that was ""immediately identifiable as something happy and joyous and it brought back a certain period in our history
when we felt that way."" ' Defendants rely principally on two prior decisions of this Court to support this argument, Berlin v. E.
C. Publications, Inc., supra, 329 F.2d 541 and Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., supra, 623 F.2d 252 . This
reliance is misplaced.

In Berlin, the copyright owners of twenty-five popular songs sued the publishers of ""Mad Magazine,"" a comic
publication, for publishing parody lyrics which the magazine's readers might sing to the music of plaintiff's songs.
Defendants did not publish the music, and plaintiffs made no claim that the parodies would even partially fulfill the demand
for plaintiff's original songs to their damage. Then Chief Judge Kaufman, writing for the court, said that ""where as here, it is
clear that the parody has neither the intent nor the effect of fulfilling the demand for the original, and where the parodist does
not appropriate a greater amount of the original work than is necessary to ‘recall or conjure up’ the object of his satire, a
finding of infringement would be improper."" 329 F.2d at 545 .

In Elsmere, the copyrighted song was an advertising jingle entitled ""| Love New York,"" which was used by the New York
State Department of Commerce in television commercials, principally to extol the merits of New York City. One of NBC's
popular productions is a satirical comedy program entitled ""Saturday Night Live"". On May 20, 1978, the performers on this
show did a take-off on New York City's advertising campaign by plugging for the biblical city of Sodom. As part of this take-
off, they sang a song ""| Love Sodom"" to the tune of ""| Love New York"". In holding this to be fair use, the district court found
that defendants’ song did not interfere with the marketability of plaintiff's;

Page 185

that it did not affect the value of the copyrighted work nor could it have the effect of fulfilling the demand for the original. 482
F.Supp. at 747 . This Court affirmed on the opinion of the district judge. 623 F.2d at 253 .

In the instant case, plaintiffs and defendants were competitors in the entertainment field. Both Bugle Boy and
Cunnilingus Champion were performed on the stage. Both were sold as recordings. Both were sold in printed copies.
Testimony, accepted as credible by the trial court, indicated that Cunnilingus Champion was made to sound like Bugle Boy to
create publicity. 425 F.Supp. at 448 . Moreover, the district judge specifically rejected as incredible the testimony of the
defendant Wilson that he was combining the innocent music of the '40's with words often considered to be taboo to make a
very funny point. 425 F.Supp. at 453 . This state of facts is a far cry from those which existed in Berlin and Elsmere.

In Elsmere, the district court held, and quite correctly so, that the song ""| Love Sodom"" was as much a parody of ""I
Love New York"" as it was of the overall ""| Love New York"" advertising campaign. The court then proceeded to state in
dictum that, even if it were found that defendants’ song did not parody plaintiff's, this would not preclude a finding of fair use.
The question, said the court, is whether the use is a valid satire or parody, not whether it is a parody of the copied song.
Appellants in the instant case contrast this dictum with Judge Cooper's apparent requirement that a legally permissible
parody must be of the copyrighted song itself, and argue that Judge Cooper erred. We agree with appellants’ argument to
the extent of holding that a permissible parody need not be directed solely to the copyrighted song but may also reflect on
life in general. However, if the copyrighted song is not at least in part an object of the parody, there is no need to conjure it
up. See Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, supra, 581 F.2d at 758 n.15. Indeed, defendants concede that, without
reference to plaintiff's song, there would be no parody.

The district court held that defendants' song was neither a parody or burlesque of Bugle Boy nor a humorous comment
on the music of the '40's. 425 F.Supp. 453 . We are not prepared to hold that a commercial composer can plagiarize a
competitor's copyrighted song, substitute dirty lyrics of his own, perform it for commercial gain, and then escape liability by
calling the end result a parody or satire on the mores of society. Such a holding would be an open-ended invitation to
musical plagiarism. We conclude that defendants did not make fair use of plaintiff's song. See Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., supra, 604 F.2d at 205-06 ; Walt Disney Productions v. Mature Pictures Corp.,
supra, 389 F.Supp. at 1398 ; Rohauer v. Killiam Shows, Inc., 379 F.Supp. 723 , 732-33 (S.D.N.Y.1974), rev'd on other
grounds, 551 F.2d 484 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 949 , 97 S.Ct. 2666 , 53 L.Ed.2d 266 (1977) ; Robert Stigwood
Group Ltd. v. O'Reilly, 346 F.Supp. 376 , 384 (D.Conn.1972), rev'd on other grounds,530 F.2d 1096 (2d Cir.), cert. denied,
429 U.S. 848 , 97 S.Ct. 135 , 50 L.Ed.2d 121 (1976) .



--- Page 4 ---
In reaching this conclusion, we have not overlooked the district court's finding that the amount copied from plaintiff's
song was so substantial as to be unfairly excessive. Although we might have reached a different conclusion on the same
facts, the district court's finding was not clearly erroneous and furnishes further support for its holding of infringement.
Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., supra, 366 F.2d at 310 ; Walt Disney Productions v. Mature Pictures
Corp., supra, 389 F.Supp. at 1398 .

Following the entry of the district court's interlocutory judgment on liability, the matter was referred to a special master
for the determination of damages. Under the law of this Circuit as it existed prior to the 1976 amendments of the Copyright
Act, the owner of an infringed copyright was entitled to recover both his own damages and the infringer's profits. Peter Pan
Fabrics, Inc. v. Jobela Fabrics, Inc., 329 F.2d 194 ,

Page 186

196-97 (2d Cir. 1964). Where it was difficult to produce legally acceptable proof of actual damages or profits, statutorily
prescribed ""in lieu"" awards could be made. Id.; Douglas v. Cunningham, 294 U.S. 207 , 208-09, 55 S.Ct. 365 , 366-367, 79
L.Ed. 862 (1935) .

Because infringement of copyright is considered a tort, the general statement often is made that all defendants
concerned in the infringement are jointly and severally liable. See, e.g., Screen Gems-Columbia Music, Inc. v. Metlis &
Lebow Corp., 453 F.2d 552 , 554 (2d Cir. 1972). However, this rule applies only to the defendants liability for damages.
Insofar as there is liability for illegal profit, the liability is several; one defendant is not liable for the profit made by another.
Washingtonian Pub. Co. v. Pearson, 140 F.2d 465 , 467 (D.C.Cir.1944); Sammons v. Colonial Press, Inc., 126 F.2d 341 ,
344-48 (1st Cir. 1942); Alfred Bell & Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts. Inc.. 86 F.Supp. 399 , 403 (S.D.N.Y.1949), aff'd, 191 F.2d 99
(2d Cir. 1951) .

In the instant case, plaintiff offered proof as to defendants’ gross receipts, and the burden was then on the defendants
to establish what portion of those receipts was not profit from their use of the infringing song. Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwin
Pictures Corp., 106 F.2d 45 , 48 (2d Cir. 1939), affd,309 U.S. 390 , 60 S.Ct. 681 , 84 L.Ed. 825 (1940) . This they failed to
do. Because the special master required to give every indulgence to plaintiffs, Orgel v. Clark Boardman Co., 301 F.2d 119 ,
121 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 817 , 83 S.Ct. 31 , 9 L.Ed.2d 58 (1962) , we cannot say that he erred in allocating one-
twentieth of the total receipts from Let My People Come to Cunnilingus Champion, although, as triers of the fact, we might
have been less generous. Based on this percentage allocation, the special master found the defendants severally liable to
plaintiff for their profit from the infringing song's performance in the show in the following amounts:

We find no error in these awards, except with regard to the defendant D'Lugoff. D'Lugoff was president of Village Gate.
Although he was in charge of the premises, he had nothing to do with Let My People Come. He was paid an annual salary of
$25,000.00. There was no proof that this salary was contingent upon or fixed by the profits of Let My People Come.
Moreover, other shows were being performed on the premises. Nevertheless, the special master awarded plaintiff one-
twentieth of D'Lugoff's salary during the two and one-half years that Let My People Come was at the Village Gate.

The term ""profit"" was not defined in the Copyright Act and therefore must be assumed to have its ordinary or usual
meaning. Heli-Coil Corp. v. Webster, 352 F.2d 156 , 167 (3d Cir. 1965). Webster's Third New International Dictionary
defines profit as ""entrepreneurial or employer income as distinguished from wages or rent."" Black's Law Dictionary, Revised
Fourth Edition, says profit is the ""(g)ain realized from business or investment over and above expenditures"" and ""(i)n
distinction from the wages of labor."" The salary paid D'Lugoff by Village Gate was not ""profit"" from Cunnilingus Champion.
The award of $3,250.00 as against him cannot stand.

The special master awarded a total of $10,005.00 against Libra, Oesterman and Wilson for their share of profits from
the record albums of the show, and this award, arising out of the unfair use of plaintiff's copyrighted song, will not be
disturbed. An award of $2,381.00 for one-nineteenth of the total receipts from souvenir programs was made against Libra
alone, and that defendant has not appealed.

Plaintiff offered no evidence of actual damages, seeking instead the ""in lieu of actual damages"" award authorized by 17
U.S.C. § 101(b), as it existed prior to 1976. See 17 U.S.C. § 101(b) (1976). The special

Page 187

master treated each week's performance of Let My People Come as a separate infringement, and awarded plaintiff a total of
$32,500.00 against all of the defendants, representing a $250.00 statutory award for each of the one hundred and thirty
weeks that Let My People Come played at the Village Gate.

In lowa State University Research Foundation, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 475 F.Supp. 78 , 82
(S.D.N.Y.1979), Judge Lumbard, sitting as a district judge, described this Circuit's test for multiple infringements as follows:

In close cases, this circuit has also used the ""time"" test-which looks to the proximity in time of repeated infringements in
deciding whether to treat them as multiple infringements or as one continuing infringement-and the ""heterogeneity"" test-
which looks to differences between the advertisers, financial arrangements, locales, audiences, and other significant
variables in determining whether the circumstances surrounding successive infringements are so similar that those
infringements should be treated as one continuing infringement or so different that they should be treated as multiple
infringements. See Robert Stigwood Group Ltd., supra, 530 F.2d 1096 , 1103. See also Davis v. E. |. duPont, supra, 249


--- Page 5 ---
F.Supp. 329 , 333-43.

We think this is a case in which the ""time"" test should have been applied and that Let My People Come's continuous
run at the Village Gate should have been treated as one continuing infringement. See Roy Export Co. v. CBS, supra, 503
F.Supp. at 1157 . In so holding, we are not unmindful of the substantial award based on defendants' profits and the fact that,
although plaintiff was not obligated to seek preliminary injunctive relief, Szekely v. Eagle Lion Films, Inc.. 140 F.Supp. 843 ,
849 (S.D.N.Y.1956) aff'd, 242 F.2d 266 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 354 U.S. 922 , 77 S.Ct. 1382 , 1 L.Ed.2d 1437 (1957) ,
prompt resort to such remedy probably would have made the question of continuous performance largely academic. See
Robert Stigwood Group, Ltd. v. O'Reilly, supra, 530 F.2d at 1103 . We note also, although we do not find it controlling, that
Congress has since decreed that a plaintiff who elects to recover statutory ""in lieu"" damages will be precluded from
recovering any profits. See 17 U.S.C. § 504(c) (1) (Supp. Ill 1979); 3 Nimmer on Copyright § 14.01(B) (1980). The
$32,500.00 award of statutory damages is reduced to $250.00.

We have no problem in affirming the award of statutory damages based upon the manufacture and sale of the cast
album recordings. These recordings contain both words and music, which together constituted an unfair use of plaintiffs
song. The printed program, however, contained only the lyrics, which, standing alone, hardly amounted to an infringement of
Bugle Boy. Moreover, we fail to see how plaintiff could conceivably have been damaged by the sale of defendants' program.
The award of $22,626.00 for the ""making"" of these programs is reversed.

Appellants’ final argument meriting comment concerns the award of $20,000.00 for the fees of plaintiff's attorney. In this
Circuit, the practice of awarding such fees ""has been sparingly used and the amounts awarded modest."" Orgel v. Clark
Boardman Co., supra, 301 F.2d at 122 . Here, plaintiff was successful in recovering on its statutory copyright claim but was
unsuccessful in its claim for infringement of an alleged common law copyright. See 425 F.Supp. at 454-55 . Moreover,
plaintiff opted to pursue the lengthy process leading to the substantial damage award which it has received, rather than
quickly halting defendants’ infringement with a preliminary injunction. Finally, it appears from the conduct of the defendants
Oesterman and Cunningham throughout the course of the litigation and the fact that they have not even bothered to appeal,
hat the burden of the award may be borne in substantial part by the defendant D'Lugoff, whose role in the infringement was
minimal at best and whose liability was questionable. See Roy Export Co. v. CBS, supra, 503 F.Supp. at 1155-56 ; Screen
Gems-Columbia

Page 188

Music, Inc. v. Mark-Fi Records, Inc., 327 F.Supp. 788 , 792 (S.D.N.Y.1971) rev'd on other grounds,453 F.2d 552 (2d Cir.
1972) . Under all the circumstances, we feel that an award of attorneys fees in the amount of $10,000.00 would be fair and
adequate.

The judgment appealed from is modified by:
1. eliminating the award of $3,250.00 against the defendant D'Lugoff for lost profits;

2. reducing the award against Wilson and D'Lugoff for damages from the performance of Cunnilingus Champion in Let
My People Come by $32,250.00;

3. eliminating the award of $22,626.00 against Wilson and D'Lugoff for damages in connection with the making of the
programs;

4. reducing the award of attorneys fees against Wilson and D'Lugoff from $20,000.00 to $10,000.00

In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.
MANSFIELD, Circuit Judge (dissenting):

| respectfully dissent for the reason that in my view the defendants made a fair and limited use in a reasonable manner
of plaintiff's successful copyrighted work to produce what amounts to a sexual satire or burlesque of contemporary mores by
putting a comic or humorous twist on the more conventional Bugle Boy and by parodying the Andrews Sisters’ style, which
depended heavily on ""boogie-woogie"" music. This entitled the defendants as to the protection of the ""fair use"" doctrine as
codified in § 101 of the 1976 Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 107. As the majority concedes, a fair use parody need not be
directed toward the copyrighted work, see Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 482 F.Supp. 741 , 746
(S.D.N.Y.1980), aff'd, 623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1980) ; Berlin v. E. C. Publications, Inc., 329 F.2d 541 (2d Cir. 1964) . The
defendants used only enough of ""Bugle Boy"" to conjure up a recollection of that image and thereby make possible a parody
with a completely new, mocking, satirical turn to it. There is no evidence that the parody caused any damage to the plaintiff.
Although ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" (plaintiff's work) and ""Cunnilingus Champion of Company C"" (defendants' parody)
were both produced in record form, there is no evidence that the latter was capable of serving as a substitute for the former.
On the contrary, it is readily apparent from the records and the lyrics that the two songs fill completely different demands
and that a purchaser desiring plaintiff's work would not accept that of defendants as a substitute.

Under the doctrine of ""fair use"" defendants were entitled to appropriate so much of the copyrighted work as was
reasonably necessary to recall it or conjure it up. Berlin v. E. C. Publications, Inc., supra, 329 F.2d at 545 . As we stated in
Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 623 F.2d 252 , 253 n.1 (2d Cir. 1980):

""Even more extensive use would still be fair use, provided the parody builds upon the original, using the original as a known


--- Page 6 ---
element of modern culture and contributing something new for humorous effect or commentary.""

This is exactly what was done in the present case. Defendants made limited use of Bugle Boy to create a new and (to
many) humorous effect. The lyrics of the two songs are almost entirely different. Indeed only one short phrase (""He's in the
Army now"") is common to both. The rest are not the same. Moreover, much of the similarity in the music of the two tunes is
attributable to the ""tom-tom"" passages in the Andrews Sisters and Midler recordings, as well as in the defendants’ work,
which were never copyrighted but were used by Judge Cooper as the basis for his findings. Thus, while | agree with the
majority that there is barely sufficient similarity between the music of the two songs to preclude our labelling Judge Cooper's
finding of infringement clearly erroneous, the record indicates that for fair use parodying the defendants only appropriated as
much of the original work as was reasonably necessary to recall Bugle Boy.

Page 189

In ruling on the issue of fair use, Judge Cooper held that to qualify as fair use the infringing item must be a burlesque of
the copyrighted work itself, not just a use of the copyrighted material to parody something else, stating:

""defendants concede that Champion was not intended to be a parody of Bugle Boy in the sense of taking Bugle Boy out of
context in an attempt to hold it up to ridicule. (PTO 3-a-51, 52) Defendants may have sought to parody life, or more
particularly sexual mores and taboos, but it does not appear that they attempted to comment ludicrously upon Bugle Boy.""
MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 425 F.Supp. at 453 (footnote omitted).

As the majority recognizes (p. 185, supra), this was error. In Elsmere Music, supra, we held that the song ""! Love
Sodom"" was a fair parody use of ""| Love New York"" even though Judge Goettel found, 482 F.Supp. at 745 , that the former
was ""an attempt ... to satirize the way in which New York City has attempted to improve its somewhat tarnished image
hrough the use of a slick advertising campaign (and) had nothing to do with ... the song '| Love New York' itself."" The district
court further stated:

""In addition, even if it were found that '| Love Sodom' did not parody the plaintiff's song itself, that finding would not preclude
a finding of fair use. Under the holding of Berlin v. E. C. Publications, Inc., supra, and the criteria set down in section 101 of
he 1976 Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 107, the issue to be resolved by a court is whether the use in question is a valid satire
or parody, and not whether it is a parody of the copied song itself. To the extent that either MCA or Walt Disney can be read
‘0 require that there be an identity between the song copied and the subject of the parody, this Court disagrees."" 482
F.Supp. at 746 (footnotes omitted).

In affirming, we agreed with the district court's rejection of Judge Cooper's MCA limitation, stating, ""Believing that, in
oday's world of often unrelieved solemnity, copyright law should be hospitable to the humor of parody, and that the District
Court correctly applied the doctrine of fair use, we affirm on Judge Goettel's thorough opinion."" 623 F.2d at 253 (footnote
omitted). This broader legal concept of parody has been advocated by copyright scholars who have taken a dim view of
Judge Cooper's limitation. See, e.g., Light, Parody, Burlesque, and the Economic Rationale for Copyright, 11 Conn.L.Rev.
615, 631-32 (1979).

Thus in Elsmere we adhered to our views in Berlin v. E. C. Publications, Inc., 329 F.2d 541 (2d Cir. 1964) , where we
held that certain parody lyrics printed in Mad Magazine, intended to comment humorously on the world of that time and
designed to be sung to the tunes of various popular Irving Berlin songs, did not infringe Berlin's copyright.

Since defendants’ work is clearly a parody or burlesque the next step is to determine whether, in creating Champion,
hey have taken more of Bugle Boy than is reasonably necessary to "" 'recall or conjure up’ the original( ),"" Berlin, supra, 329
F.2d at 545 . This will vary according to the situation encountered in each case. Clearly a verbatim copy of both music and
lyrics could hardly be defended as a parody, since the effect would be to deprive the copyright owner of the fruits of his
labors. On the other hand, a substantial taking for parody purposes is permissible where, as here, the parody does not fulfill
he demand for the copyrighted work. For instance, in Elsmere Judge Goettel observed that

""it becomes apparent that this portion of the piece, the musical phrase that the lyrics 'l| Love New York' accompany, is the
heart of the (plaintiff's) composition. Use of such a significant (albeit less than extensive) portion of the composition is far
more than merely a de minimis taking.... The tune of '| Love Sodom’ is easily recognizable as 'having been appropriated from
he copyrighted work,’ ... and is a taking of a substantial nature."" 482 F.Supp. at 744 (footnote and citations omitted).

Page 190

However, he correctly concluded that the copying nevertheless amounted to fair use as a parody. As we started in
Berlin,

""At the very least, where, as here, it is clear that the parody has neither the intent nor the effect of fulfilling the demand
or the original, and where the parodist does not appropriate a greater amount of the original work than is necessary to
‘recall or conjure up' the object of his satire, a finding of infringement would be improper."" 329 F.2d at 545 .

On the Elsmere appeal we observed,

""we note that the concept of ‘conjuring up' an original came into the copyright law not as a limitation on how much of an
original may be used, but as a recognition that a parody frequently needs to be more than a fleeting evocation of an original
in order to make its humorous point. Columbia Pictures Corp. v. National Broadcasting Co., 137 F.Supp. 348 , 354



--- Page 7 ---
(S.D.Cal.1955). A parody is entitled at least to 'conjure up’ the original. Even more extensive use would still be fair use,
provided the parody builds upon the original, using the original as a known element of modern culture and contributing
something new for humorous effect of commentary."" 623 F.2d at 253 n.1.

Judge Cooper, having erroneously limited the scope of permissible use of a copyrighted work for parody purposes,
reached this issue only by way of dictum, indicating that he would have held the defendants’ use to be excessive because
""Champion not only conjures up the memory of Bugle Boy, it shares some of the same lyrics and music."" 425 F.Supp. at 454
. This is both a misunderstanding of the ""conjure up"" test and a misconstruction of the facts. As both Berlin and Elsmere
demonstrate, the fact that the parody shares some of the same lyrics and music as the copyrighted work does not itself
mean that the taking is too substantial. Indeed it is exactly by such overlap that the original is recalled or conjured up. In
Elsmere the repetition of the exact music from the key ""| Love New York"" section of that song, coupled with use of two of the
four original words (""I Love""), was held not to be too substantial a taking to allow the fair use defense. As we stated in
Berlin,

""While brief phrases of the original lyrics were occasionally injected into the parodies, this practice would seem necessary if
the defendants’ efforts were to 'recall or conjure up' the originals; the humorous effect achieved when a familiar line is
interposed in a totally incongruous setting, traditionally a tool of parodists, scarcely amounts to a ‘substantial’ taking, if that
standard is not to be woodenly applied."" 329 F.2d at 545 .

Here, the defendants took only one short phrase from the entire copyrighted lyric. The rest of the thematic conjuring
was done by the overall setting and the word play on the title. That word play is the very kind of ""conjuring up"" that the fair
use defense allows. As for the music, the discussion above shows that even in the absence of a fair use question there is
some doubt as to whether the taking from the copyrighted version would be substantial enough to amount to an
infringement. The overall musical style is the same, the harmony and melody are similar, and there are a few specific chord
and note passages that overlap. None of this, however, is so great as to preclude the parody defense. The humorous twist
would not exist if the ""boogie woogie"" sound of the original (incidentally, not copyrighted) were not recalled. The whole point
of the fair use defense is to allow some use of the copyrighted material. Here it was not excessive.

The next question is whether the defendants’ use of Bugle Boy resulted in their satisfying the same demand as that
song did, which is an important factor because an otherwise fair use might become unfair if it deprives the copyright holder
of the market served by him and thus causes him real economic damage, 3 M. Nimmer, Copyright, § 13.05(A)(4), note 3. In
Meeropol v. Nizer, 560 F.2d 1061 , 1070 (2d Cir. 1977), we stated:

""A key issue in fair use cases is whether the defendant's work tends to diminish or prejudice the potential sale of
plaintiffs work. Marvin Worth Productions

Page 191

v. Superior Films Corp., 319 F.Supp. 1269 , 1274 (168 USPQ 693 , 697-698) (S.D.N.Y.1970); 2 M. Nimmer Copyright, §
415.""

This issue was not reached by Judge Cooper because of his erroneous ruling that defendants' work did not burlesque
plaintiff's copyrighted work itself. 425 F.Supp. at 453 n.19. Plaintiff-appellee argues that since the two works were exploited
through the same media (records, printed copies, live performances) Champion ipso facto had the effect of diminishing the
demand for Bugle Boy. In my view this reasoning is fatally defective. The issue is not whether the parody uses the same
media as the copyrighted work-most parodies do-but whether it is ""capable of serving as a substitute for the original,"" A.
Latman, The Copyright Law 215 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis supplied), which depends on demand and product overlap rather
than on the market in which the two products are vended. Applying this correct standard it is eminently clear that the two
works respond to wholly differing demands and that a customer for one would not buy the other in its place. A raucous and
explicitly sexual satire is not a substitute for the innocence of Bugle Boy. | therefore cannot agree with the majority's
""premise that the songs were competing works,"" Maj. Op. 183, or that the sale or rendition of defendants’ song would
interfere with the marketability of plaintiff's song.

The majority implies that to ""substitute dirty lyrics"" should not permit a person to ""escape liability by calling the end
result a parody or satire on the mores of society."" Maj. Op. 185. In my view the defendants’ use of ""dirty lyrics"" or of
language and allusions that | might personally find distasteful or even offensive is wholly irrelevant to the issue before us,
which is whether the defendants’ use, obscene or not, is permissible under the fair use doctrine as it has evolved over the
years. We cannot, under the guise of deciding a copyright issue, act as a board of censors outlawing X-rated performances.
Obscenity or pornography play no part in this case. Moreover, permissible parody, whether or not in good taste, is the price
an artist pays for success, just as a public figure must tolerate more personal attack than the average private citizen. New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 , 84 S.Ct. 710 , 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964) . As we pointed out in Berlin parody ""has
thrived from the time of Chaucer."" 329 F.2d at 545 . Even the Canterbury Tales indulged largely in sexual satire.

Lastly, since there is no evidence of actual or potential economic damage caused to MCA by reason of defendants’
performance and sale of recordings of Champion, | believe that the award of damages here is inappropriate, excessive, and
an unjustifiable windfall to the plaintiff.

For these reasons | would reverse the judgment of the district court.

COLUMBUS REHABILITATION AND SUBACUTE INSTITUTE et al., Defendants—Appellants.
No. 15AP-782.
Court of Appeals of Ohio, Tenth District, Franklin County.
Dec. 10, 2015.
53 N.E.3d 954]
The Dickson Firm, L.L.C., Blake A. Dickson and Daniel Z. Inscore, for appellee.
Bonezzi Switzer Polito & Hupp Co. L.P.A., G. Brenda Coey and Jennifer R. Becker, for appellants.
BRUNNER, J.

{{ 1} Plaintiff-appellee, Richard Fravel, as the personal representative of the estate of Jack Fravel (“decedent”), brought this
action alleging that the employees and/or agents of defendant-appellant Columbus Rehabilitation and Subacute Institute

53 N.E.3d 955]

provided inadequate care to decedent and caused him to develop a pressure ulcer that became infected and resulted in his
death. Appellants pled the affirmative defense that some of appellee's claims were subject to an arbitration agreement and
were outside the jurisdiction of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Decedent's surviving spouse, Nancy Fravel,
executed the arbitration agreement on decedent's behalf. Appellants moved to stay the matter and submit it to binding
arbitration pursuant to the agreement. The motion was denied. On appeal, appellants ask this court to remand the matter
with instruction to stay appellee's “survivorship” claim for referral to alternative dispute resolution, and to stay any claims not
subject to the arbitration agreement pending resolution of the arbitrable claims.

{2} Appellants further submit that the trial court erred in requiring them to produce policies and procedures without a
confidentiality agreement and protective order. They assert that the policies and procedures are protected by copyright and,
therefore, request that we further instruct the trial court to enter a protective order.

|. MOTION TO DISMISS

{{ 3} Appellee moves to dismiss the appeal and argues that no final appealable order has been entered pursuant to R.C.
2505.02. We do not agree.

{4 4} R.C. 2711.02(C) provides:

[A]n order * * * that grants or denies a stay of a trial of any action pending arbitration, including, but not limited to,
an order that is based upon a determination of the court that a party has waived arbitration under the arbitration
agreement, is a final order and may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed on appeal pursuant to the Rules
of Appellate Procedure and, to the extent not in conflict with those rules, Chapter 2505. of the Revised Code.

{4 5} The trial court denied the motion to stay solely on the ground that appellants had waived their right to pursue
arbitration. Appellee filed this lawsuit on July 10, 2014, and the answer was filed on August 11, 2014. Appellants engaged in
written discovery, and the parties scheduled depositions. Appellants filed the motion for stay just over one month prior to the
original July 21, 2015 trial date and ten months after they had asserted their right of arbitration in their answer. The trial
court's disposition of the motion for stay fell squarely within the description of a final order pursuant to R.C. 2711.02(C).

{{ 6} In addition, the courts of the state have held that an order compelling the production of allegedly privileged documents
to an opposing party, however interlocutory, is a final appealable order. Csonka—Cherney v. ArcelorMittal Cleveland, Inc.,
2014-Ohio-836, 9 N.E.3d 515 , J 10 (8th Dist.) ; Pinnix v. Marc Glassman, Inc., 8th Dist. No. 97998, 2012-Ohio-3263, 2012
WL 2928647, 9 8 ; Cobb v. Shipman, 11th Dist. No. 2011-T-0049, 2012-Ohio-1676, 2012 WL 1269128, 4 34, 35. These
decisions treat such orders as granting or denying a provisional remedy and, thus, final orders pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)
(4). As we observed in Heinrichs v. 356 Registry, Inc., 10th Dist. No. 13AP—361, 2013-Ohio-4161, 2013 WL 5407044, § 13,
“[dliscovery orders have historically been held to be interlocutory and thus neither final nor appealable. * * * But with the
amendment to R.C. 2505.02, the General Assembly recognized that a discovery order compelling the disclosure of
privileged matter constituted a provisional remedy that could be final and appealable. * * * Similarly, an order that compels
the discovery of confidential matter is also a provisional remedy.” As long

[53 N.E.3d 956]

as an appellant presents a colorable claim that the documents in question are privileged and/or confidential, the proceeding
which results in the discovery order is treated as a provisional remedy. /d. at J 15. “ ‘Otherwise, an appellate court would be
forced to decide the merits of the appeal in order to determine whether it has the power to hear and decide the merits of the


--- Page 2 ---
appeal.’ ” Id., quoting Bennett v. Martin, 186 Ohio App.3d 412 , 2009-Ohio-6195, 928 N.E.2d 763 , 35 (10th Dist.).

{§ 7} Both the order denying appellants’ application for a stay and the discovery order requiring production of documents
without a protective order were final orders from which an interlocutory appeal may lie. Appellee's motion to dismiss and for
sanctions is denied. Appellants’ motion to strike appellee's notice of supplemental authority is therefore moot.

Il. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR
{{ 8} On the merits of the appeal, appellants address an assignment of error to each of the orders at issue:

[l.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS' MOTION TO STAY
PROCEEDINGS AND COMPEL/ENFORCE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT.

[Il] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT ORDERED APPELLANTS TO PRODUCE THE POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES WITHOUT A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND/OR STIPULATED PROTECTIVE ORDER
BECAUSE THEY ARE PROTECTED BY THE COPYRIGHT PRIVILEGE.

Ill. DISCUSSION

{{ 9} The first assignment of error concerns waiver of arbitration, while the second concerns the trial court's order compelling
discovery, once it determined that appellants had waived arbitration. The question whether the arbitration agreement is valid
or enforceable is a matter of law for de novo review._Taylor Bldg. Corp. of Am. v. Benfield. 117 Ohio St.3d 352 , 2008-Ohio-
938, 884 N.E.2d 12 § 37. The contractual right to arbitration, like any other contractual right, may be waived. Pinnell v.
Cugini & Cappoccia Builders, Inc., 10th Dist. No. 183AP—579, 2014-Ohio-669, 2014 WL 742430, § 17 ; Dispatch Printing Co.
v. Recovery Ltd. Partnership, 10th Dist. No. 10AP—353, 2011-Ohio-80, 2011 WL 199120, 4 19. However, a court will not
lightly infer waiver of a right to arbitrate. Morris v. Morris, 189 Ohio App.3d 608 , 2010-Ohio-4750, 939 N.E.2d 928 , 4 18
(10th Dist.). To establish such a waiver, the party asserting waiver must prove that the waiving party knew of the right to
arbitrate and, based on the totality of the circumstances, acted inconsistently with that right. Pinnell at 18; Blackburn v.
Citifinancial, Inc., 10th Dist. No. O5AP—733, 2007-Ohio-1463, 2007 WL 927222, 4 17. Hunter v. Rhino Shield, 10th Dist. No.
15AP—172, 2015-Ohio-4603, 2015 WL 6779395, | 16. The issue whether appellants have waived any right to arbitration is
fact driven and reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Pinnell at ¢ 17. See also Hunter at J 17 (“The standard under which an
appellate court reviews an order granting or denying a stay pending arbitration depends on the nature of the issues involved.
Pinnell at ¢ 17. When the issue is whether a party waived its right to arbitrate, appellate courts review a trial court's judgment
for an abuse of discretion. /d.; Morris at § 17. Appellate courts apply this standard because resolution of the waiver issue
requires a fact-intensive analysis. Pinnell at 17; Morris at ¥ 17.”). The phrase “abuse of

[53 N.E.3d 957]

discretion” implies that the trial court's attitude was arbitrary, unreasonable or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5
Ohio St.3d 217 , 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983) .

{{ 10} Appellants argue that the circumstances of this case do not permit a finding of waiver. In their timely answer, they
raised the affirmative defense that issues in dispute were subject to an arbitration agreement. Appellants acknowledge that
hey submitted written discovery and requested depositions, and when appellee did not comply they filed a motion for
extension of time to conduct discovery. In their brief they insist that the discovery was essential for them “to adequately
defend against Appellee's baseless allegations,” including the claim that decedent's wife, Nancy, did not have authority to
sign the arbitration agreement on his behalf. (Appellant's Corrected Brief, 27.) Nancy signed on a line entitled “Signature of
Legal Representative for Healthcare Decisions.” (July 8, 2015 Reply Memorandum, second exhibit A.)

{11} Decedent was admitted to the nursing home on May 23, 2013 following a two-month hospitalization at Ohio State
University Wexner Medical Center for a ruptured brain aneurysm. According to his Nancy, he was unable to hold any
conversation. He communicated by squeezing a hand or blinking his eyes. He could not read or hold a pen to write. Nancy
gave further deposition testimony that decedent was unable to wash his face or brush his teeth. He had a feeding tube, a
racheostomy tube, and a catheter. The staff bathed him. He was physically unable to use the call light and could not assist
with turning and repositioning himself. Appellants maintain that under such extreme disability decedent clearly could not sign
any agreement, and Nancy at least had apparent authority to consent to arbitration, as she was the one who decided to
place her husband in the nursing home for post-hospital care and signed all of the admission-related paperwork.

{12} The trial court did not address the issue of authorization or other matters affecting enforceability because it first
considered the issue of waiver. “A party asserting waiver must prove that the waiving party knew of the existing right to
arbitrate and, based on the totality of the circumstances, acted inconsistently with that known right.” Dispatch Printing Co. at
4 21, citing Murtha v. Ravines of McNaughton Condominium Assn., 10th Dist. No. O9AP-709, 2010-Ohio-1325, 2010 WL
1229211, ¥ 21.

In determining whether the totality of the circumstances includes actions inconsistent with the right to arbitrate, a
court may consider: (1) whether the party seeking arbitration invoked the court's jurisdiction by filing a complaint
or claim without first requesting a stay, (2) the length of the delay, if any, in seeking arbitration, (3) the extent to
which the party seeking arbitration has participated in the litigation, and (4) whether the inconsistent acts of the


--- Page 3 ---
party seeking arbitration prejudiced the party asserting waiver. Pinnell at 18; Dispatch Printing Co. at § 21. In
short, waiver occurs when a party's active participation in a lawsuit evinces an acquiescence to proceeding in a
judicial forum. Pinnell at ¥ 18; Blackburn at 4 19.

Hunter at § 16.

{ 13} “Waiver attaches where there is active participation in a lawsuit evincing an acquiescence to proceeding in a judicial
orum.” Tinker v. Oldaker, 10th Dist. No. O3AP—671, 2004-Ohio-3316, 2004 WL 1405563, § 21. In Pinnell , the appellants
invoked the trial court's jurisdiction by filing a counterclaim for breach of the

53 N.E.3d 958]

operating agreement at issue without first requesting a stay. They did not request a stay until over 12 months after the
appellees filed their complaint and over 11 months after the appellants filed their answer and counterclaim. The appellants in
Pinnell participated in extensive discovery and finally filed the motion to stay less than two and one-half months before the
rial date and only as an alternative in the event they received an unfavorable ruling on their summary judgment motion on
he merits of the appellees’ claims. Even though the appellees could assert prejudice only vaguely, in terms of additional
legal fees and other costs of arbitration, we concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding, under the
otality of the circumstances, appellants acted inconsistently with their right to arbitrate. “The record supports the conclusion
hat appellants took an active role in this lawsuit, evincing their acquiescence to proceeding in a judicial forum, and only
wanted arbitration in the event the trial court issued an unfavorable ruling on their motion for summary judgment.” Pinnell at
q24.

{{ 14} Appellants in the matter under review did not evince such an attempt to seek judgment on the merits, but,
nevertheless, they did not promptly move for a stay and instead actively used the court proceedings to obtain discovery.
Moreover, enforcement of the arbitration agreement would engender proceedings in two separate forums, as appellants
concede that only decedent's claims which survive him are subject to arbitration. The wrongful death claims of the statutory
beneficiaries, pursuant to R.C. 2125.02(A)(1), may not be forced into arbitration where each of them did not sign the
agreement. Peters v. Columbus Steel Castings Co., 115 Ohio St.3d 134 , 2007-Ohio-4787, 873 N.E.2d 1258 , § 19-20. We
overruled the first assignment of error. On account of the litigation activities of appellants, their delay in seeking an
arbitration stay and the potential prejudice via piecemeal litigation to appellee, the trial court acted within its sound discretion
to find waiver and deny appellants’ motion for stay.

{4 15} Thereafter, the trial court compelled discovery from appellants. The discovery order on appeal compelled production
of accurate copies of appellants’ institutional policies and procedures. Appellants refused to produce these policies and
procedures on the basis that they are copyrighted but consented to turn them over if appellee agreed to a protective order.
At paragraph four of its August 6, 2015 decision and entry, the trial court stated that it “in no way sees how the existence of a
copyright prevents Defendants from having to produce the requested policies and procedures. The copyright itself provides
Defendants with all the protection they need in regards to the subject materials and a further protective order is of no use.”

{ 16} Our statement in Nunez Vega v. Tivurcio, 10th Dist. No. 14AP—327, 2014-Ohio-4588, 2014 WL 5306844, 9, is
apposite to the standard of review for appellants’ assertion of a copyright privilege:

A trial court “possesses broad discretion over the discovery process,” and, therefore, appellate courts “generally
review a trial court's decision regarding a discovery matter only for an abuse of discretion.” MA Equip. Leasing |,
L.L.C. v. Tilton, 10th Dist. No. 12AP—564, 2012-Ohio-4668 [980 N.E.2d 1072], ¥ 13. Nevertheless, an abuse of
discretion standard “is inappropriate for reviewing a judgment based upon a question of law, including an
erroneous interpretation of the law.” /d. in general, the issue as to “whether information sought in discovery

[53 N.E.3d 959]

is confidential and privileged ‘is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.’ ” /d., quoting Med. Mut. of Ohio v.
Schlotterer, 122 Ohio St.3d 181 , 2009-Ohio-2496 [909 N.E.2d 1237], ¥ 13. This court has also recognized,
however, “with respect to a privilege claim, the appropriate standard of review depends on whether the privilege
claim presents a question of law or a question of fact.” Randall v. Cantwell Mach. Co., 10th Dist. No. 12AP—786,
2013-Ohio-2744 [2013 WL 3341201], 4 9. Accordingly, “[w]hen it is necessary to interpret and apply statutory
language to determine whether certain information is confidential and privileged, a de novo standard applies.” /d.
By contrast, “[w]hen a claim of privilege requires review of factual questions, such as whether an attorney-client
relationship existed, an abuse-of-discretion standard applies.” /d.

{{ 17} The trial court essentially held that appellants failed to establish legal grounds to shield their copyrighted policies and
procedures from discovery in litigation against them, and so we review its decision compelling discovery de novo. “ ‘De novo
appellate review means that the court of appeals independently reviews the record and affords no deference to the trial
court's decision.’ ” (Internal citations deleted.) Deutsche Bank Natl. Trust Co. v. Thomas, 10th Dist. No. 14AP—809, 2015-

{{] 18} We have reviewed the record and the law relating to appellee's motion to compel production and find that appellants’
copyright protection did not afford them the right to withhold policies and procedures potentially relevant to the care and


--- Page 4 ---
treatment of decedent and appellee's claims of malfeasance. Although appellants may have obtained federal copyright
protection for the materials, they remain amenable to “fair use” under 17 U.S.C. 107, which codified the exception to
copyright protection the courts had carved:

[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any
other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
(including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In
determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall
include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
The legislative history of this section indicates that “reproduction of a work in legislative or judicial proceedings or reports”
was contemplated among “the sort of activities the courts might regard as fair use under the circumstances.” House

Committee on the Judiciary, H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476 (1976).

{{ 19} In addition, courts considering the issue have found reproduction of copyrighted works for litigation to fall within the
fair use doctrine. See Bond v. Blum, 317 F.3d 385 , 396 (4th Cir.2003) (the defendant's use of the plaintiff's entire
copyrighted work in a child custody proceeding “does not undermine the protections granted by the [Copyright] Act but only
serves the important societal interest in

[53 N.E.3d 960]

having evidence before the factfinder”); Jartech, Inc. v. Clancy, 666 F.2d 403 (9th Cir.1982) (city council's use of copyrighted
material in legal proceedings was not “the same intrinsic use to which the copyright holders expected protection from
unauthorized use”); Denison v. Larkin, 64 F.Supp.3d 1127, 1133-34 (N.D.III.2014) (using portions of the plaintiff's
copyrighted blog as evidence against her in attorney disciplinary proceeding did not supersede blog's purpose as a forum to
discuss purported courtroom corruption and otherwise was fair use consistent with 17 U.S.C. 107 ); Stern v. Does. 978
F.Supp.2d 1031 , 1044-49 (C.D.Cal.2011) (‘“[rleproduction of copyrighted material for use in litigation or potential litigation is
generally fair use, even if the material is copied in whole”); Healthcare Advocates, Inc. v. Harding, Earley, Follmer & Frailey,
497 F.Supp.2d 627 , 638 (E.D.Pa.2007) (law firm's copying of entire set of copyrighted web pages was justified since web
pages were relevant evidence in litigation).

{{ 20} The use of appellants’ policies and procedures is not commercial in the context of litigation. Nor is creativity of the
work a factor. Appellants do not dispute that some of their policies and procedures may be relevant, but they suggest that
some policies, for example, those related to patient falls, have no relevance. However, appellants’ objection to the discovery
is based on copyright protection and privilege, and against the legal backdrop of fair use, they have established no basis to
condition the requested production of documents on execution of an agreed protective order, nor privilege against discovery
of their policies and procedures. Appellants also have indicated no market, let alone effect on a potential market for or value
of the copyrighted materials, to support a need for confidentiality. The institution furnishes its policies and procedures to
residents and its staff pursuant to R.C. 3721.12(A)(3)(c).

{{ 21} Appellants’ reliance on Byrd v. U.S. Xpress, Inc., 1st Dist., 2014-Ohio-5733, 26 N.E.3d 858 , does not support its
argument. The defendant in that case successfully argued that provisions of the protective order issued by the trial court
permitted sharing of confidential/trade secret information with attorneys involved in other lawsuits in a manner that was
overbroad and lacked procedural safeguards consistent with the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, R.C. 1333.61 et seq. Civ.R.
26(C)(7) authorizes a court to issue an order “that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial
information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way.” Appellants do not make the case that their policies
and procedures should be afforded under the law protection beyond copyright, which does not include any privilege
precluding or limiting use in the litigation at issue. Appellants do not, as a matter of policy, require a confidentiality
agreement from its residents upon admission, and the law does not require this from a patient or his or her personal
representative before patient care policies may be disclosed in litigation. The second assignment of error is overruled.

IV. CONCLUSION

{22} We overrule both of the assignments of error and affirm the orders of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas
denying appellants' motion to stay proceedings and granting appellee's motion to compel production of appellants’ patient
care policies. We further deny appellee's motion to dismiss and for sanctions and find moot appellants’ motion to strike
appellee's supplemental authority. We note that the trial court in its judgment entry held in abeyance appellee's motion for

[53 N.E.3d 961]

sanctions filed before the trial court and remains in the best position to monitor the progress of the litigation and adjudge the

ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF , IT IS HEREBY ORDERED , ADJUDGED , AND DECREED that the judgment of
said District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.

Appellants Estate of James Oscar Smith and Hebrew Hustle, Inc. appeal from the May 30, 2017 judgment of the United

States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Pauley, J.) granting Appellees’ motion for summary judgment on
the ground that the alleged


--- Page 2 ---
Page 3

copyright infringement was fair use. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and
specification of issues for review.

We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. Blanch v . Koons, 467 F.3d 244 , 249 (2d Cir. 2006).
""Summary judgment should be granted if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to

judgment as a matter of law."" /d. at 250. ""Although fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, this court has on a number
of occasions resolved fair use determinations at the summary judgment stage where there are no genuine issues of material
fact."" /d. (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted).

While the law affords copyright protection to promote the progress of science and useful arts, ""the law has long
recognized that some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials is necessary to promote [that] progress."" TCA
Television Corp . v.McCollum__839 F.3d 168 , 177-78 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). The statutory
framework for analyzing fair use, codified in 17 U.S.C. § 107, provides four nonexclusive factors that should be considered
when deciding if a particular work makes fair use of another:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

These factors are analyzed individually but weighed together. TCA__839 F.3d at 179.

We agree with the district court that Defendants’ use of the ""Jimmy Smith Rap"" in ""Pound Cake"" is fair use. The
statutory factors support our conclusion in this case.

The first factor supports fair use because the use was transformative. A work is transformative when it ""uses the

copyrighted material itself for a purpose, or imbues it with a character, different from that for which it was created."" TCA__ 839
F.3d at 180 . ""Pound Cake"" does just that. The message of the ""Jimmy Smith Rap"" is one about the supremacy of jazz to the
derogation of other types of music, which—unlike jazz—will not last. On the other hand, ""Pound Cake"" sends a counter
message—that it is not jazz music that reigns supreme, but rather all ""real music,"" regardless of genre. App'x at 325.

Beyond the text of the lyrics themselves, ""Pound Cake"" situates its sampling of approximately thirty-five seconds of the
""Jimmy Smith Rap"" at the beginning of an approximately seven-minute-long hip-hop song in which Drake and Shawn Carter,
professionally known as Jay-Z, rap about the greatness and authenticity of their work. Through both the alteration of the
""Jimmy Smith Rap"" and the rest of the rap's lyrics, ""Pound Cake"" emphasizes that it is not the genre but the authenticity of
the music that matters. In this manner, ""Pound Cake"" criticizes the jazz-elitism that the ""Jimmy Smith Rap"" espouses. By
doing so, it uses the copyrighted work for ""a purpose, or imbues it with a character, different from that for which it was
created."" TCA__ 839 F.3d at 180.

We need not spend much time on the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work. This factor ""has rarely played
a significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute,"" and when a work is transformative, the factor may nonetheless
support fair use. Authors Guild v.

Page 4

Google , Inc ., 804 F.3d 202 , 220 (2d Cir. 2015). The district court found that the second factor weighs against a finding of
fair use here. This factor is of ""limited usefulness,"" however, where, as we have determined applies here, ""the creative work
of art is being used for a transformative purpose."" Bill Graham Archives v . Dorling Kindersley Ltd ., 448 F.3d 605 , 612 (2d
Cir. 2006).

The third factor too supports fair use. This factor looks at ""whether the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" TCA__839 F.3d at 185
(alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted). We have been clear, however, that ""the law does not require that
the secondary artist may take no more than is necessary."" Cariou v . Prince__714 F.3d 694 , 710 (2d Cir. 2013). ""The
secondary use must be permitted to conjure up at /east enough of the original to fulfill its transformative purpose."" /d.
(brackets, internal quotation marks, and citations omitted). Here, the amount used by Defendants is reasonable. While
""Pound Cake"" borrows language from the ""Jimmy Smith Rap"" detailing the production process for Off the Top , this was
necessary to emphasize its own message: that the ultimate attribute of music is its authenticity, not the production process
that created it.

Finally, the fourth factor also weighs in favor of fair use. ""The final statutory factor considers the effect of the use upon
the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, focusing on whether the secondary use usurps demand for the
protected work by serving as a market substitute."" TCA_, 839 F.3d at 186 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In
the case at hand, there is no evidence that ""Pound Cake"" usurps demand for ""Jimmy Smith Rap"" or otherwise cause a
negative market effect. ""Pound Cake,"" a piece by a hip-hop artist about rap and hip-hop music, appeals to a much different
audience than does ""Jimmy Smith Rap,"" which was a piece by a jazz musician on a jazz album about jazz music. See



--- Page 3 ---
Cariou__714 F.3d at 709 (emphasizing that ""Prince's work appeals to an entirely different sort of collector than Cariou's""). Nor
is there evidence of the existence of an active market for ""Jimmy Smith Rap,"" which is vital for defeating Defendants' fair use
defense. See TCA__839 F.3d at 186-87 ; Cariou__714 F.3d at 709 (weighing in favor of fair use that ""Cariou has not
aggressively marketed his work""); Blanch__467 F.3d at 258 (noting that Blanch had never published or licensed ""Silk
Sandals"" subsequent to its appearance in Allure when holding fair use applied).

We have considered the remainder of Appellants’ arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the order
of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.

CAMPBELL, AKA SKYYWALKER, ET AL.
v.
ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.

No. 92-1292.
Supreme Court of United States.
Argued November 9, 1993.
Decided March 7, 1994.

Respondent Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., filed suit against petitioners, the members of the rap music group 2 Live Crew and
their record company, claiming that 2 Live Crew's song, ""Pretty Woman,"" infringed Acuff-Rose's copyright in Roy Orbison's
rock ballad, ""Oh, Pretty Woman."" The District Court granted summary judgment for 2 Live Crew, holding that its song was a
parody that made fair use of the original song. See Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U. S. C. § 107. The Court of Appeals reversed
and remanded, holding that the commercial nature of the parody rendered it presumptively unfair under the first of four
factors relevant under § 107; that, by taking the ""heart"" of the original and making it the ""heart"" of a new work, 2 Live Crew
had, qualitatively, taken too much under the third § 107 factor; and that market harm for purposes of the fourth § 107 factor
had been established by a presumption attaching to commercial uses.

Held: 2 Live Crew's commercial parody may be a fair use within the meaning of § 107. Pp. 574-594.

(a) Section 107, which provides that ""the fair use of a copyrighted work . . . for purposes such as criticism [or] comment
... iS not an infringement . . .,"" continues the common-law tradition of fair use adjudication and requires case-by-case
analysis rather than bright-line rules. The statutory examples of permissible uses provide only general guidance. The four
statutory factors are to be explored and weighed together in light of copyright's purpose of promoting science and the arts.
Pp. 574-578.

(b) Parody, like other comment and criticism, may claim fair use. Under the first of the four § 107 factors, ""the purpose
and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature . . .,"" the enquiry focuses on whether the
new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or whether and to what extent it is ""transformative,"" altering
the original with new expression, meaning, or message. The more transformative the new work, the less will be the
significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use. The heart of any parodist's
claim to quote from existing material is the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to

510 U. S. Reports 570

create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's work. But that tells courts little about where to draw the
line. Thus, like other uses, parody has to work its way through the relevant factors. Pp. 578-581.

(c) The Court of Appeals properly assumed that 2 Live Crew's song contains parody commenting on and criticizing the
original work, but erred in giving virtually dispositive weight to the commercial nature of that parody by way of a
presumption, ostensibly culled from Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, 451, that ""every
commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively . . . unfair... ."" The statute makes clear that a work's commercial
nature is only one element of the first factor enquiry into its purpose and character, and Sonyitself called for no hard
evidentiary presumption. The Court of Appeals's rule runs counter to Sony and to the long common-law tradition of fair use
adjudication. Pp. 581-585.

(d) The second § 107 factor, ""the nature of the copyrighted work,"" is not much help in resolving this and other parody
cases, since parodies almost invariably copy publicly known, expressive works, like the Orbison song here. P. 586.

(e) The Court of Appeals erred in holding that, as a matter of law, 2 Live Crew copied excessively from the Orbison
original under the third § 107 factor, which asks whether ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole"" are reasonable in relation to the copying's purpose. Even if 2 Live Crew's copying of the
original's first line of lyrics and characteristic opening bass riff may be said to go to the original's ""heart,"" that heart is what
most readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim. Moreover, 2 Live Crew thereafter
departed markedly from the Orbison lyrics and produced otherwise distinctive music. As to the lyrics, the copying was not
excessive in relation to the song's parodic purpose. As to the music, this Court expresses no opinion whether repetition of
the bass riff is excessive copying, but remands to permit evaluation of the amount taken, in light of the song's parodic
purpose and character, its transformative elements, and considerations of the potential for market substitution. Pp. 586-589.

(f) The Court of Appeals erred in resolving the fourth § 107 factor, ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work,"" by presuming, in reliance on Sony, supra, at 451, the likelihood of significant market harm
based on 2 Live Crew's use for commercial gain. No ""presumption"" or inference of market harm that might find support in

Sonyis applicable to a case involving something beyond mere duplication for commercial purposes. The cognizable harm is
market substitution, not any harm from criticism. As to parody


--- Page 2 ---
510 U. S. Reports 571

pure and simple, it is unlikely that the work will act as a substitute for the original, since the two works usually serve different
market functions. The fourth factor requires courts also to consider the potential market for derivative works. See, e. g.,
Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539, 568. If the later work has cognizable substitution effects
in protectible markets for derivative works, the law will look beyond the criticism to the work's other elements. 2 Live Crew's
song comprises not only parody but also rap music. The absence of evidence or affidavits addressing the effect of 2 Live
Crew's song on the derivative market for a nonparody, rap version of ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" disentitled 2 Live Crew, as the
proponent of the affirmative defense of fair use, to summary judgment. Pp. 590-594.

972 F. 2d 1429, reversed and remanded.

Cobert. *

JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
We are called upon to decide whether 2 Live Crew's commercial parody of Roy Orbison's song, ""Oh, Pretty Woman,""

510 U. S. Reports 572

may be a fair use within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U. S. C. § 107 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV). Although the
District Court granted summary judgment for 2 Live Crew, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding the defense of fair use
barred by the song's commercial character and excessive borrowing. Because we hold that a parody's commercial character
is only one element to be weighed in a fair use enquiry, and that insufficient consideration was given to the nature of parody
in weighing the degree of copying, we reverse and remand.

In 1964, Roy Orbison and William Dees wrote a rock ballad called ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" and assigned their rights in it to
respondent Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. See Appendix A, infra, at 594. Acuff-Rose registered the song for copyright protection.

Petitioners Luther R. Campbell, Christopher Wongwon, Mark Ross, and David Hobbs are collectively known as 2 Live
Crew, a popular rap music group. ' In 1989, Campbell wrote a song entitled ""Pretty Woman,"" which he later described in an
affidavit as intended, ""through comical lyrics, to satirize the original work. . . ."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a. On July 5, 1989, 2
Live Crew's manager informed Acuff-Rose that 2 Live Crew had written a parody of ""Oh, Pretty Woman,"" that they would
afford all credit for ownership and authorship of the original song to Acuff-Rose, Dees, and Orbison, and that they were
willing to pay a fee for the use they wished to make of it. Enclosed with the letter were a copy of the lyrics and a recording of
2 Live Crew's song. See Appendix B, infra, at 595. Acuff-Rose's agent refused permission, stating that ""| am aware of the
success

[510 U.S. 573]

enjoyed by ‘The 2 Live Crews’, but | must inform you that we cannot permit the use of a parody of ‘Oh, Pretty Woman."" App.
to Pet. for Cert. 85a. Nonetheless, in June or July 1989, 2 2 Live Crew released records, cassette tapes, and compact discs
of ""Pretty Woman"" in a collection of songs entitled ""As Clean As They Wanna Be."" The albums and compact discs identify
the authors of ""Pretty Woman"" as Orbison and Dees and its publisher as Acuff-Rose.

Almost a year later, after nearly a quarter of a million copies of the recording had been sold, Acuff-Rose sued 2 Live
Crew and its record company, Luke Skyywalker Records, for copyright infringement. The District Court granted summary
judgment for 2 Live Crew, ° reasoning that the commercial purpose of 2 Live Crew's song was no bar to fair use; that 2 Live
Crew's version was a parody, which ""quickly degenerates into a play on words, substituting predictable lyrics with shocking
ones"" to show ""how bland and banal the Orbison song"" is; that 2 Live Crew had taken no more than was necessary to
""conjure up"" the original in order to parody it; and that it was ""extremely unlikely that 2 Live Crew's song could adversely
affect the market for the original."" 754 F. Supp. 1150 , 1154-1155, 1157-1158 (MD Tenn. 1991). The District Court weighed
these factors and held that 2 Live Crew's song made fair use of Orbison's original. /d., at 1158-1159.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded. 972 F. 2d 1429 , 1439 (1992). Although it assumed
for the purpose of its opinion that 2 Live Crew's song

510 U. S. Reports 574

was a parody of the Orbison original, the Court of Appeals thought the District Court had put too little emphasis on the fact
that ""every commercial use . . . is presumptively . . . unfair,"" Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc._ 464 U.S.


--- Page 3 ---
417 , 451 (1984), and it held that ""the admittedly commercial nature"" of the parody ""requires the conclusion"" that the first of
four factors relevant under the statute weighs against a finding of fair use. 972 F. 2d, at 1435, 1437. Next, the Court of
Appeals determined that, by ""taking the heart of the original and making it the heart of a new work,"" 2 Live Crew had,
qualitatively, taken too much. /d., at 1438. Finally, after noting that the effect on the potential market for the original (and the
market for derivative works) is ""undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use,"" Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v.
Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539 , 566 (1985), the Court of Appeals faulted the District Court for ""refus[ing] to indulge the
presumption"" that ""harm for purposes of the fair use analysis has been established by the presumption attaching to
commercial uses."" 972 F. 2d, at 1438-1439. In sum, the court concluded that its ""blatantly commercial purpose . . . prevents
this parody from being a fair use."" /d., at 1439.

We granted certiorari, 507 U. S. Reports 1003 (1993) , to determine whether 2 Live Crew's commercial parody could
be a fair use.

It is uncontested here that 2 Live Crew's song would be an infringement of Acuff-Rose's rights in ""Oh, Pretty Woman,""
under the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U. S. C. § 106 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV), but for a finding of fair use through parody. +

4,436) (CCD Mass. 1845). Similarly, Lord Ellenborough expressed the inherent tension in the need simultaneously to protect
copyrighted material and to allow others to build upon it when he wrote, ""while | shall think myself bound to secure every
man in the enjoyment of his copy-right, one must not put manacles upon science.""

[510 U.S. 576]

Carey v. Kearsley, 4 Esp. 168, 170, 170 Eng. Rep. 679, 681 (K. B. 1803). In copyright cases brought under the Statute of
Anne of 1710, ® English courts held that in some instances ""fair abridgements"" would not infringe an author's rights, see W.
Patry, The Fair Use Privilege in Copyright Law 6-17 (1985) (hereinafter Patry); Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103
Harv. L. Rev. 1105 (1990) (hereinafter Leval), and although the First Congress enacted our initial copyright statute, Act of
May 31, 1790, 1 Stat. 124 , without any explicit reference to ""fair use,"" as it later came to be known,’ the doctrine was
recognized by the American courts nonetheless.

In Folsomv. Marsh, 9 F. Cas. 342 (No. 4,901) (CCD Mass. 1841), Justice Story distilled the essence of law and
methodology from the earlier cases: ""look to the nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value of the
materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of
the original work."" /d., at 348. Thus expressed, fair use remained exclusively judge-made doctrine until the passage of the
1976 Copyright Act, in which Justice Story's summary is discernible: ®

""§ 107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use

""Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by
reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an
infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular
510 U. S. Reports 577

case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

""(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit
educational purposes;

""(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
""(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
""(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

""The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of
all the above factors."" 17 U. S. C. § 107 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV).

Congress meant § 107 ""to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any
way"" and intended that courts continue the common-law tradition of fair use adjudication. H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 66
(1976) (hereinafter House Report); S. Rep. No. 94-473, p. 62 (1975) (hereinafter Senate Report). The fair use doctrine thus


--- Page 4 ---
""permits [and requires] courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very
creativity which that law is designed to foster."" Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S. Reports 207 , 236 (1990) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted).

The task is not to be simplified with bright-line rules, for the statute, like the doctrine it recognizes, calls for case-by-
case analysis. Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 560; Sony, 464 U. S. Reports 448, and n. 31; House Report, pp. 65-66;
Senate Report, p. 62. The text employs the terms ""including"" and ""such as"" in the preamble paragraph to indicate the
""illustrative and not limitative"" function of the examples given, § 101; see Harper & Row, supra, at 561, which thus provide
only general guidance about the sorts of copying that courts and

510 U. S. Reports 578

Congress most commonly had found to be fair uses. 9 Nor may the four statutory factors be treated in isolation, one from
another. All are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright. See Leval 1110-1111;
Patry & Perlmutter, Fair Use Misconstrued: Profit, Presumptions, and Parody, 11 Cardozo Arts & Ent. L. J. 667, 685-687
(1993) (hereinafter Patry & Perlmutter). 1°

A

The first factor in a fair use enquiry is ""the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes."" § 107(1). This factor draws on Justice Story's formulation, ""the
nature and objects of the selections made."" Folsomv. Marsh, supra, at 348. The enquiry here may be guided by the
examples given in the preamble to § 107, looking to whether the use is for criticism, or comment, or news reporting,

510 U. S. Reports 579

and the like, see § 107. The central purpose of this investigation is to see, in Justice Story's words, whether the new work
merely ""supersede[s] the objects"" of the original creation, Folsomv. Marsh, supra, at 348; accord, Harper & Row, supra, at
562 (""supplanting"" the original), or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the
first with new expression, meaning, or message; it asks, in other words, whether and to what extent the new work is
""transformative."" Leval 1111. Although such transformative use is not absolutely necessary for a finding of fair use, Sony,
supra, at 455, n. 40, '! the goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of
transformative works. Such works thus lie at the heart of the fair use doctrine's guarantee of breathing space within the
confines of copyright, see, e. g., Sony, supra, at 478-480 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), and the more transformative the new
work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.

This Court has only once before even considered whether parody may be fair use, and that time issued no opinion
because of the Court's equal division. Benny v. Loew's Inc.,_239 F. 2d 532 (CA9 1956) , aff'd sub nom. Columbia
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Loew's Inc.,_356 U. S. Reports 43 (1958) . Suffice it to say now that parody has an obvious
claim to transformative value, as Acuff-Rose itself does not deny. Like less ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, it can
provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a new one. We thus line up with the
courts that have held that parody, like other comment or criticism, may claim fair use under § 107. See, e. g., Fisherv. Dees,
794 F. 2d 432 (CA9 1986) (""When Sonny Sniffs Glue,"" a parody of ""When Sunny Gets Blue,"" is fair use); Elsmere Music,
Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 482 F. Supp. 741

510 U. S. Reports 580

(SDNY), aff'd, 623 F. 2d 252 (CA2 1980) (""I Love Sodom,"" a ""Saturday Night Live"" television parody of ""| Love New York,"" is
fair use); see also House Report, p. 65; Senate Report, p. 61 (""[U]se in a parody of some of the content of the work
parodied"" may be fair use).

The germ of parody lies in the definition of the Greek parodeia, quoted in Judge Nelson's Court of Appeals dissent, as
""a song sung alongside another."" 972 F. 2d, at 1440, quoting 7 Encyclopedia Britannica 768 (15th ed. 1975). Modern
dictionaries accordingly describe a parody as a ""literary or artistic work that imitates the characteristic style of an author or a
work for comic effect or ridicule,"" '? or as a ""composition in prose or verse in which the characteristic turns of thought and
phrase in an author or class of authors are imitated in such a way as to make them appear ridiculous.” 1° For the purposes
of copyright law, the nub of the definitions, and the heart of any parodist's claim to quote from existing material, is the use of
some elements of a prior author's composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's works.
See, e. g., Fisherv. Dees, supra, at 437; MCA, Inc. v. Wilson,677 F. 2d 180 , 185 (CA2 1981). If, on the contrary, the
commentary has no critical bearing on the substance or style of the original composition, which the alleged infringer merely
uses to get attention or to avoid the drudgery in working up something fresh, the claim to fairness in borrowing from
another's work diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like the extent of its commerciality, loom
larger. ‘4 Parody needs to mimic

510 U. S. Reports 581

an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its victim's (or collective victims’) imagination,
whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing. '5 See ibid. ; Bisceglia,



--- Page 5 ---
Parody and Copyright Protection: Turning the Balancing Act Into a Juggling Act, in ASCAP, Copyright Law Symposium, No.
34, p. 25 (1987).

The fact that parody can claim legitimacy for some appropriation does not, of course, tell either parodist or judge much
about where to draw the line. Like a book review quoting the copyrighted material criticized, parody may or may not be fair
use, and petitioners' suggestion that any parodic use is presumptively fair has no more justification in law or fact than the
equally hopeful claim that any use for news reporting should be presumed fair, see Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 561.
The Act has no hint of an evidentiary preference for parodists over their victims, and no workable presumption for parody
could take account of the fact that parody often shades into satire when society is lampooned through its creative artifacts,
or that a work may contain both parodic and nonparodic elements. Accordingly, parody, like any other use, has to work its
way through the relevant factors, and be judged case by case, in light of the ends of the copyright law.

Here, the District Court held, and the Court of Appeals assumed, that 2 Live Crew's ""Pretty Woman"" contains parody,

510 U. S. Reports 582

commenting on and criticizing the original work, whatever it may have to say about society at large. As the District Court
remarked, the words of 2 Live Crew's song copy the original's first line, but then ""quickly degenerat[e] into a play on words,
substituting predictable lyrics with shocking ones . . . [that] derisively demonstrat[e] how bland and banal the Orbison song
seems to them."" 754 F. Supp., at 1155 (footnote omitted). Judge Nelson, dissenting below, came to the same conclusion,
that the 2 Live Crew song ""was clearly intended to ridicule the white-bread original"" and ""reminds us that sexual congress
with nameless streetwalkers is not necessarily the stuff of romance and is not necessarily without its consequences. The
singers (there are several) have the same thing on their minds as did the lonely man with the nasal voice, but here there is
no hint of wine and roses."" 972 F. 2d, at 1442. Although the majority below had difficulty discerning any criticism of the
original in 2 Live Crew's song, it assumed for purposes of its opinion that there was some. /d., at 1435-1436, and n. 8.

We have less difficulty in finding that critical element in 2 Live Crew's song than the Court of Appeals did, although
having found it we will not take the further step of evaluating its quality. The threshold question when fair use is raised in
defense of parody is whether a parodic character may reasonably be perceived. '® Whether, going beyond that, parody is in
good taste or bad does not and should not matter to fair use. As Justice Holmes explained, ""[i]t would be a dangerous
undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of [a work], outside of the
narrowest and most obvious limits. At

[510 U. S. Reports 583]

the one extreme some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive
until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke."" Bleisteinv. Donaldson Lithographing Co.,.188 U.
S. 239 , 251 (1903) (circus posters have copyright protection); cf. Yankee Publishing Inc. v. News America Publishing, Inc.,
809 F. Supp. 267 , 280 (SDNY 1992) (Leval, J.) (""First Amendment protections do not apply only to those who speak clearly,
whose jokes are funny, and whose parodies succeed"") (trademark case).

While we might not assign a high rank to the parodic element here, we think it fair to say that 2 Live Crew's song
reasonably could be perceived as commenting on the original or criticizing it, to some degree. 2 Live Crew juxtaposes the
romantic musings of a man whose fantasy comes true, with degrading taunts, a bawdy demand for sex, and a sigh of relief
from paternal responsibility. The later words can be taken as a comment on the naivete of the original of an earlier day, as a
rejection of its sentiment that ignores the ugliness of street life and the debasement that it signifies. It is this joinder of
reference and ridicule that marks off the author's choice of parody from the other types of comment and criticism that
traditionally have had a claim to fair use protection as transformative works. '”

The Court of Appeals, however, immediately cut short the enquiry into 2 Live Crew's fair use claim by confining its
treatment of the first factor essentially to one relevant fact, the commercial nature of the use. The court then inflated the
significance of this fact by applying a presumption ostensibly

510 U. S. Reports 584

culled from Sony, that ""every commercial use of copy-righted material is presumptively . . . unfair. . . ."" Sony, 464 U. S.
Reports 451 . In giving virtually dispositive weight to the commercial nature of the parody, the Court of Appeals erred.

The language of the statute makes clear that the commercial or nonprofit educational purpose of a work is only one
element of the first factor enquiry into its purpose and character. Section 107(1) uses the term ""including"" to begin the
dependent clause referring to commercial use, and the main clause speaks of a broader investigation into ""purpose and
character."" As we explained in Harper & Row, Congress resisted attempts to narrow the ambit of this traditional enquiry by
adopting categories of presumptively fair use, and it urged courts to preserve the breadth of their traditionally ample view of
the universe of relevant evidence. 471 U. S. Reports 561 ; House Report, p. 66. Accordingly, the mere fact that a use is
educational and not for profit does not insulate it from a finding of infringement, any more than the commercial character of a
use bars a finding of fairness. If, indeed, commerciality carried presumptive force against a finding of fairness, the
presumption would swallow nearly all of the illustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of § 107, including news
reporting, comment, criticism, teaching, scholarship, and research, since these activities ""are generally conducted for profit
in this country."" Harper & Row, supra, at 592 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Congress could not have intended such a rule, which


--- Page 6 ---
certainly is not inferable from the common-law cases, arising as they did from the world of letters in which Samuel Johnson
could pronounce that ""[n]o man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money."" 3 Boswell's Life of Johnson 19 (G. Hill ed.
1934),

Sonyitself called for no hard evidentiary presumption. There, we emphasized the need for a ""sensitive balancing of
interests,"" 464 U. S. Reports 455, n. 40, noted that Congress had ""eschewed a rigid, bright-line approach to fair use,"" id., at

[510 U.S. 585]

449, n. 31, and stated that the commercial or nonprofit educational character of a work is ""not conclusive,"" id., at 448-449,
but rather a fact to be ""weighed along with other[s] in fair use decisions,"" id., at 449, n. 32 (quoting House Report, p. 66).
The Court of Appeals's elevation of one sentence from Sonyto a per se rule thus runs as much counter to Sonyitself as to
he long common-law tradition of fair use adjudication. Rather, as we explained in Harper & Row, Sony stands for the
proposition that the ""fact that a publication was commercial as opposed to nonprofit is a separate factor that tends to weigh
against a finding of fair use."" 471 U. S. Reports 562. But that is all, and the fact that even the force of that tendency will
vary with the context is a further reason against elevating commerciality to hard presumptive significance. The use, for
example, of a copyrighted work to advertise a product, even in a parody, will be entitled to less indulgence under the first
actor of the fair use enquiry than the sale of a parody for its own sake, let alone one performed a single time by students in
school. See generally Patry & Perlmutter 679-680; Fisherv. Dees, 794 F. 2d, at 437; Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell, 803 F.
2d 1253 , 1262 (CA2 1986); Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F. 2d 1510 , 1522 (CA9 1992). 18

510 U. S. Reports 586

B

The second statutory factor, ""the nature of the copy-righted work,"" § 107(2), draws on Justice Story's expression, the
""value of the materials used."" Folsomv. Marsh, 9 F. Cas., at 348. This factor calls for recognition that some works are closer
to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish
when the former works are copied. See, e. g., Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S. Reports 237 -238 (contrasting fictional short
story with factual works); Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 563 -564 (contrasting soon-to-be-published memoir with
published speech); Sony, 464 U. S. Reports 455, n. 40 (contrasting motion pictures with news broadcasts); Feist_499 U. S.
Reports 348 -351 (contrasting creative works with bare factual compilations); 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on
Copyright § 13.05[A][2] (1993) (hereinafter Nimmer); Leval 1116. We agree with both the District Court and the Court of
Appeals that the Orbison original's creative expression for public dissemination falls within the core of the copyright's
protective purposes. 754 F. Supp., at 1155-1156 ; 972 F. 2d, at 1437. This fact, however, is not much help in this case, or
ever likely to help much in separating the fair use sheep from the infringing goats in a parody case, since parodies almost
invariably copy publicly known, expressive works.

Cc

The third factor asks whether ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a
whole,"" § 107(3) (or, in Justice Story's words, ""the quantity and value of the materials used,"" Folsomv. Marsh, supra, at 348)
are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying. Here, attention turns to the persuasiveness of a parodist's
justification for the particular copying done, and the enquiry will harken back to the first of the statutory factors, for, as in
prior cases, we recognize that the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character

510 U. S. Reports 587

of the use. See Sony, supra, at 449-450 (reproduction of entire work ""does not have its ordinary effect of militating against a
inding of fair use"" as to home videotaping of television programs); Harper & Row, supra, at 564 (""[E]ven substantial
quotations might qualify as fair use in a review of a published work or a news account of a speech"" but not in a scoop of a
soon-to-be-published memoir). The facts bearing on this factor will also tend to address the fourth, by revealing the degree
‘o which the parody may serve as a market substitute for the original or potentially licensed derivatives. See Leval 1123.

The District Court considered the song's parodic purpose in finding that 2 Live Crew had not helped themselves
overmuch. 754 F. Supp., at 1156-1157. The Court of Appeals disagreed, stating that ""[wJhile it may not be inappropriate to
ind that no more was taken than necessary, the copying was qualitatively substantial. . .. We conclude that taking the heart
of the original and making it the heart of a new work was to purloin a substantial portion of the essence of the original."" 972
F. 2d, at 1438.

The Court of Appeals is of course correct that this factor calls for thought not only about the quantity of the materials
used, but about their quality and importance, too. In Harper & Row, for example, the Nation had taken only some 300 words
out of President Ford's memoirs, but we signaled the significance of the quotations in finding them to amount to ""the heart of
the book,"" the part most likely to be newsworthy and important in licensing serialization. 471 U. S. Reports 564-566 , 568
(internal quotation marks omitted). We also agree with the Court of Appeals that whether ""a substantial portion of the
infringing work was copied verbatim"" from the copyrighted work is a relevant question, see id., at 565, for it may reveal a
dearth of transformative character or purpose under the first factor, or a greater likelihood of market harm under the fourth; a
work composed primarily of an original, particularly its heart, with little added or changed,


--- Page 7 ---
510 U. S. Reports 588
is more likely to be a merely superseding use, fulfilling demand for the original.

Where we part company with the court below is in applying these guides to parody, and in particular to parody in the
song before us. Parody presents a difficult case. Parody's humor, or in any event its comment, necessarily springs from
recognizable allusion to its object through distorted imitation. Its art lies in the tension between a known original and its
parodic twin. When parody takes aim at a particular original work, the parody must be able to ""conjure up"" at least enough of
that original to make the object of its critical wit recognizable. See, e. g., Elsmere Music, 623 F. 2d, at 253, n. 1;Fisherv.
Dees, 794 F. 2d, at 438-439. What makes for this recognition is quotation of the original's most distinctive or memorable
features, which the parodist can be sure the audience will know. Once enough has been taken to assure identification, how
much more is reasonable will depend, say, on the extent to which the song's overriding purpose and character is to parody
the original or, in contrast, the likelihood that the parody may serve as a market substitute for the original. But using some
characteristic features cannot be avoided.

We think the Court of Appeals was insufficiently appreciative of parody's need for the recognizable sight or sound when
it ruled 2 Live Crew's use unreasonable as a matter of law. It is true, of course, that 2 Live Crew copied the characteristic
opening bass riff (or musical phrase) of the original, and true that the words of the first line copy the Orbison lyrics. But if
quotation of the opening riff and the first line may be said to go to the ""heart"" of the original, the heart is also what most
readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim. Copying does not become excessive
in relation to parodic purpose merely because the portion taken was the original's heart. If 2 Live Crew had copied a
significantly less memorable part of the original, it is difficult to see how its parodic character

510 U. S. Reports 589
would have come through. See Fisherv. Dees, supra, at 439.

This is not, of course, to say that anyone who calls himself a parodist can skim the cream and get away scot free. In
parody, as in news reporting, see Harper & Row, supra, context is everything, and the question of fairness asks what else
the parodist did besides go to the heart of the original. It is significant that 2 Live Crew not only copied the first line of the
original, but thereafter departed markedly from the Orbison lyrics for its own ends. 2 Live Crew not only copied the bass riff
and repeated it, '® but also produced otherwise distinctive sounds, interposing ""scraper"" noise, over-laying the music with
solos in different keys, and altering the drum beat. See 754 F. Supp., at 1155 . This is not a case, then, where ""a substantial
portion” of the parody itself is composed of a ""verbatim"" copying of the original. It is not, that is, a case where the parody is
so insubstantial, as compared to the copying, that the third factor must be resolved as a matter of law against the parodists.

Suffice it to say here that, as to the lyrics, we think the Court of Appeals correctly suggested that ""no more was taken
than necessary,"" 972 F. 2d, at 1438, but just for that reason, we fail to see how the copying can be excessive in relation to
its parodic purpose, even if the portion taken is the original's ""heart."" As to the music, we express no opinion whether
repetition of the bass riff is excessive copying, and we remand to permit evaluation of the amount taken, in light of the
song's parodic purpose and character, its transformative elements, and considerations of the potential for market
substitution sketched more fully below.

510 U. S. Reports 590
D

The fourth fair use factor is ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" §
107(4). It requires courts to consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged
infringer, but also ""whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant . . . would result in
a substantially adverse impact on the potential market"" for the original. Nimmer § 13.05[A][4], p. 13-102.61 (footnote
omitted); accord, Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 569 ; Senate Report, p. 65; Folsomv. Marsh, 9 F. Cas., at 349. The
enquiry ""must take account not only of harm to the original but also of harm to the market for derivative works."" Harper &
Row, supra, at 568.

Since fair use is an affirmative defense, ®° its proponent would have difficulty carrying the burden of demonstrating fair
use without favorable evidence about relevant markets. 2! In moving for summary judgment, 2 Live Crew left themselves at
just such a disadvantage when they failed to address the effect on the market for rap derivatives, and confined themselves
0 uncontroverted submissions that there was no likely effect on the market for the original. They did not, however, thereby
subject themselves to the evidentiary presumption applied by the Court of Appeals. In assessing the likelihood of significant
market harm, the Court of Appeals

510 U. S. Reports 591

quoted from language in Sony that ""'[i]f the intended use is for commercial gain, that likelihood may be presumed. But if it is
‘or a noncommercial purpose, the likelihood must be demonstrated."" 972 F. 2d, at 1438, quoting Sony, 464 U. S. Reports
451. The court reasoned that because ""the use of the copyrighted work is wholly commercial, . .. we presume that a
likelihood of future harm to Acuff-Rose exists."" 972 F. 2d, at 1438. In so doing, the court resolved the fourth factor against 2
Live Crew, just as it had the first, by applying a presumption about the effect of commercial use, a presumption which as



--- Page 8 ---
applied here we hold to be error.

No ""presumption"" or inference of market harm that might find support in Sonyis applicable to a case involving
something beyond mere duplication for commercial purposes. Sony's discussion of a presumption contrasts a context of
verbatim copying of the original in its entirety for commercial purposes, with the noncommercial context of Sonyitself (home
copying of television programming). In the former circumstances, what Sony said simply makes common sense: when a
commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of an original, it clearly ""supersede[s] the objects,"" Folsomv.
Marsh, supra, at 348, of the original and serves as a market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable market harm
to the original will occur. Sony, supra, at 451. But when, on the contrary, the second use is transformative, market
substitution is at least less certain, and market harm may not be so readily inferred. Indeed, as to parody pure and simple, it
is more likely that the new work will not affect the market for the original in a way cognizable under this factor, that is, by
acting as a substitute for it (""supersed[ing] [its] objects""). See Leval 1125; Patry & Perlmutter 692, 697-698. This is so
because the parody and the original usually serve different market functions. Bisceglia, ASCAP, Copyright Law Symposium,
No. 34, at 23.

We do not, of course, suggest that a parody may not harm the market at all, but when a lethal parody, like a scathing

510 U. S. Reports 592

theater review, kills demand for the original, it does not produce a harm cognizable under the Copyright Act. Because
""parody may quite legitimately aim at garroting the original, destroying it commercially as well as artistically,"" B. Kaplan, An
Unhurried View of Copyright 69 (1967), the role of the courts is to distinguish between ""[b]iting criticism [that merely]
suppresses demand [and] copyright infringement[, which] usurps it."" Fisherv. Dees, 794 F. 2d, at 438.

This distinction between potentially remediable displacement and unremediable disparagement is reflected in the rule
that there is no protectible derivative market for criticism. The market for potential derivative uses includes only those that
creators of original works would in general develop or license others to develop. Yet the unlikelihood that creators of
imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion
of a potential licensing market. ""People ask . . . for criticism, but they only want praise."" S. Maugham, Of Human Bondage
241 (Penguin ed. 1992). Thus, to the extent that the opinion below may be read to have considered harm to the market for
parodies of ""Oh, Pretty Woman,"" see 972 F. 2d, at 1439, the court erred. Accord, Fisherv. Dees, supra, at 437; Leval 1125;
Patry & Perlmutter 688-691. 22

In explaining why the law recognizes no derivative market for critical works, including parody, we have, of course, been
speaking of the later work as if it had nothing but a critical aspect ( i. e., ""parody pure and simple,"" supra, at 591). But the
later work may have a more complex character, with effects not only in the arena of criticism but also in protectible markets
for derivative works, too. In that sort of case, the law looks beyond the criticism to the other elements of the work, as it does
here. 2 Live Crew's song comprises not

510 U. S. Reports 593

only parody but also rap music, and the derivative market for rap music is a proper focus of enquiry, see Harper & Row,
supra, at 568; Nimmer § 13.05[B]. Evidence of substantial harm to it would weigh against a finding of fair use, °° because the
licensing of derivatives is an important economic incentive to the creation of originals. See 17 U. S. C. § 106(2) (copyright
owner has rights to derivative works). Of course, the only harm to derivatives that need concern us, as discussed above, is
the harm of market substitution. The fact that a parody may impair the market for derivative uses by the very effectiveness of
its critical commentary is no more relevant under copyright than the like threat to the original market. 24

Although 2 Live Crew submitted uncontroverted affidavits on the question of market harm to the original, neither they,
nor Acuff-Rose, introduced evidence or affidavits addressing the likely effect of 2 Live Crew's parodic rap song on the
market for a nonparody, rap version of ""Oh, Pretty Woman."" And while Acuff-Rose would have us find evidence of a rap
market in the very facts that 2 Live Crew recorded a rap parody of ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" and another rap group sought a
license to record a rap derivative, there was no evidence that a potential rap market was harmed in any way by 2 Live
Crew's parody, rap version. The fact that 2 Live Crew's parody sold as part of a collection of rap songs says very little about
the parody's effect on a market for a rap version of the original, either of the music alone or of the music with its lyrics. The
District Court essentially passed

[510 U. S. Reports 594]

on this issue, observing that Acuff-Rose is free to record ""whatever version of the original it desires,"" 754 F. Supp., at 1158 ;

the Court of Appeals went the other way by erroneous presumption. Contrary to each treatment, it is impossible to deal with

the fourth factor except by recognizing that a silentrecord on an important factor bearing on fair use disentitled the proponent
of the defense, 2 Live Crew, to summary judgment. The evidentiary hole will doubtless be plugged on remand.

It was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude that the commercial nature of 2 Live Crew's parody of ""Oh, Pretty
Woman"" rendered it presumptively unfair. No such evidentiary presumption is available to address either the first factor, the
character and purpose of the use, or the fourth, market harm, in determining whether a transformative use, such as parody,


--- Page 9 ---
is a fair one. The court also erred in holding that 2 Live Crew had necessarily copied excessively from the Orbison original,
considering the parodic purpose of the use. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the
case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Briefs of amici curiae were filed for Home Box Office et al. by Daniel M. Waggoner, P. Cameron DeVore, George Vradenburg, Bonnie Bogin, and
Richard Cotton; and for Warner Bros. by Cary H. Sherman and Robert Alan Garrett.

1. Rap has been defined as a ""style of black American popular music consisting of improvised rhymes performed to a rhythmic accompaniment."" The
Norton/Grove Concise Encyclopedia of Music 613 (1988). 2 Live Crew plays ""[b]ass music,"" a regional, hip-hop style of rap from the Liberty City area of
Miami, Florida. Brief for Petitioners 34.

2. The parties argue about the timing. 2 Live Crew contends that the album was released on July 15, and the District Court so held. 754 F. Supp. 1150 ,
1152 (MD Tenn. 1991). The Court of Appeals states that Campbell's affidavit puts the release date in June, and chooses that date. 972 F. 2 d 1429 , 1432
(CA6 1992). We find the timing of the request irrelevant for purposes of this enquiry. See n. 18, infra, discussing good faith.

3. 2 Live Crew's motion to dismiss was converted to a motion for summary judgment. Acuff-Rose defended against the motion, but filed no cross-motion.
4. Section 106 provides in part:
""Subject to sections 107 through 120, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:

""(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;


--- Page 11 ---
""(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;

""(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending . .

A derivative work is defined as one ""based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original
work of authorship, is a “derivative work."" 17 U. S. C. § 101.

2 Live Crew concedes that it is not entitled to a compulsory license under § 115 because its arrangement changes ""the basic melody or fundamental
character"" of the original. § 115(a)(2).

5. The exclusion of facts and ideas from copyright protection serves that goal as well. See § 102(b) (""In no case does copyright protection for an original
work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery...""); Feist Publications, Inc. v.
Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 , 359 (1991) (""[FJacts contained in existing works may be freely copied""); Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v.
Nation Enterprises,_471 U.S. 539 , 547 (1985) (copyright owner's rights exclude facts and ideas, and fair use).

6. An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, 8 Anne, ch. 19.
7. Patry 27, citing Lawrence v. Dana, 15 F. Cas. 26, 60 (No. 8,136) (CCD Mass. 1869).
8. Leval 1105. For a historical account of the development of the fair use doctrine, see Patry 1-64.

9. See Senate Report, p. 62 (""[W]hether a use referred to in the first sentence of section 107 is a fair use in a particular case will depend upon the
application of the determinative factors"").

10. Because the fair use enquiry often requires close questions of judgment as to the extent of permissible borrowing in cases involving parodies (or
other critical works), courts may also wish to bear in mind that the goals of the copyright law, ""to stimulate the creation and publication of edifying matter,""
Leval 1134, are not always best served by automatically granting injunctive relief when parodists are found to have gone beyond the bounds of fair use.
See 17 U.S. C. § 502(a) (court "" may ... grant . . . injunctions on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement"") (emphasis
added); Leval 1132 (while in the ""vast majority of cases, [an injunctive] remedy is justified because most infringements are simple piracy,"" such cases are
""worlds apart from many of those raising reasonable contentions of fair use"" where ""there may be a strong public interest in the publication of the
secondary work [and] the copyright owner's interest may be adequately protected by an award of damages for whatever infringement is found""); Abend v.
MCA, Inc.,_863 F. 2d 1465 , 1479 (CA9 1988) (finding ""special circumstances"" that would cause ""great injustice"" to defendants and ""public injury"" were
injunction to issue), aff'd sub nom. Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S. Reports 207 (1990) .

11. The obvious statutory exception to this focus on transformative uses is the straight reproduction of multiple copies for classroom distribution.
12. American Heritage Dictionary 1317 (3d ed. 1992).
13. 11 Oxford English Dictionary 247 (2d ed. 1989).

14. A parody that more loosely targets an original than the parody presented here may still be sufficiently aimed at an original work to come within our
analysis of parody. If a parody whose wide dissemination in the market runs the risk of serving as a substitute for the original or licensed derivatives (see
infra, at 590-594, discussing factor four), it is more incumbent on one claiming fair use to establish the extent of transformation and the parody's critical
relationship to the original. By contrast, when there is little or no risk of market substitution, whether because of the large extent of transformation of the
earlier work, the new work's minimal distribution in the market, the small extent to which it borrows from an original, or other factors, taking parodic aim at
an original is a less critical factor in the analysis, and looser forms of parody may be found to be fair use, as may satire with lesser justification for the
borrowing than would otherwise be required.

15. Satire has been defined as a work ""in which prevalent follies or vices are assailed with ridicule,"" 14 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 500, or are
""attacked through irony, derision, or wit,"" American Heritage Dictionary, supra, at 1604.

16. The only further judgment, indeed, that a court may pass on a work goes to an assessment of whether the parodic element is slight or great, and the
copying small or extensive in relation to the parodic element, for a work with slight parodic element and extensive copying will be more likely to merely
""supersede the objects"" of the original. See infra, at 586-594, discussing factors three and four.

17. We note in passing that 2 Live Crew need not label their whole album, or even this song, a parody in order to claim fair use protection, nor should 2
Live Crew be penalized for this being its first parodic essay. Parody serves its goals whether labeled or not, and there is no reason to require parody to
state the obvious (or even the reasonably perceived). See Patry & Perlmutter 716-717.

18. Finally, regardless of the weight one might place on the alleged infringer's state of mind, compare Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 562 (fair use
presupposes good faith and fair dealing) (quotation marks omitted), with Folsom v. Marsh, 9 F. Cas. 342, 349 (No. 4,901) (CCD Mass. 1841) (good faith
does not bar a finding of infringement); Leval 1126-1127 (good faith irrelevant to fair use analysis), we reject Acuff-Rose's argument that 2 Live Crew's
request for permission to use the original should be weighed against a finding of fair use. Even if good faith were central to fair use, 2 Live Crew's actions
do not necessarily suggest that they believed their version was not fair use; the offer may simply have been made in a good-faith effort to avoid this
litigation. If the use is otherwise fair, then no permission need be sought or granted. Thus, being denied permission to use a work does not weigh against
a finding of fair use. See Fisher v. Dees,_794 F. 2 d 432 , 437 (CAQ 1986).

19. This may serve to heighten the comic effect of the parody, as one witness stated, App. 32a, Affidavit of Oscar Brand; see also Elsmere Music, Inc. v.
National Broadcasting Co., 482 F. Supp. 741 , 747 (SDNY 1980) (repetition of ""| Love Sodom""), or serve to dazzle with the original's music, as Acuff-
Rose now contends.

20. Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 561 _; H. R. Rep. No. 102-836, p. 3, n. 3 (1992).

21. Even favorable evidence, without more, is no guarantee of fairness. Judge Leval gives the example of the film producer's appropriation of a
composer's previously unknown song that turns the song into a commercial success; the boon to the song does not make the film's simple copying fair.
Leval 1124, n. 84. This factor, no less than the other three, may be addressed only through a ""sensitive balancing of interests."" Sony Corp. of America v.
Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 , 455, n. 40 (1984). Market harm is a matter of degree, and the importance of this factor will vary, not only with
the amount of harm, but also with the relative strength of the showing on the other factors.

22. We express no opinion as to the derivative markets for works using elements of an original as vehicles for satire or amusement, making no comment


--- Page 12 ---
on the original or criticism of it.

23. See Nimmer § 13.05[A][4], p. 13-102.61 (""a substantially adverse impact on the potential market""); Leval 1125 (""reasonably substantial"" harm); Patry
& Perlmutter 697-698 (same).

24. In some cases it may be difficult to determine whence the harm flows. In such cases, the other fair use factors may provide some indicia of the likely
source of the harm. A work whose overriding purpose and character is parodic and whose borrowing is slight in relation to its parody will be far less likely
to cause cognizable harm than a work with little parodic content and much copying.

JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring.

| agree that remand is appropriate and join the opinion of the Court, with these further observations about the fair use
analysis of parody.

The common-law method instated by the fair use provision of the copyright statute, 17 U. S. C. § 107 (1988 ed. and
Supp. IV), presumes that rules will emerge from the course of decisions. | agree that certain general principles are now
discernible to define the fair use exception for parody. One of these rules, as the Court observes, is that parody may qualify
as fair use regardless of whether it is published or performed

510 U. S. Reports 597

for profit. Ante, at 591. Another is that parody may qualify as fair use only if it draws upon the original composition to make
humorous or ironic commentary about that same composition. Ante, at 580. It is not enough that the parody use the original
in a humorous fashion, however creative that humor may be. The parody must target the original, and not just its general
style, the genre of art to which it belongs, or society as a whole (although if it targets the original, it may target those features
as well). See Rogers v. Koons, 960 F. 2d 301 , 310 (CA2 1992) (""[T]hough the satire need not be only of the copied work
and may . . . also be a parody of modern society, the copied work must be, at least in part, an object of the parody""); Fisher
v. Dees, 794 F. 2d 432 , 436 (CA9 1986) (""[A] humorous or satiric work deserves protection under the fair-use doctrine only
if the copied work is at least partly the target of the work in question""). This prerequisite confines fair use protection to works
whose very subject is the original composition and so necessitates some borrowing from it. See MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 677 F.
2d 180 , 185 (CA2 1981) (""[I]f the copyrighted song is not at least in part an object of the parody, there is no need to conjure
it up""); Bisceglia, Parody and Copyright Protection: Turning the Balancing Act Into a Juggling Act, in ASCAP, Copyright Law
Symposium, No. 34, pp. 23-29 (1987). It also protects works we have reason to fear will not be licensed by copyright holders
who wish to shield their works from criticism. See Fisher, supra, at 437 (""Self-esteem is seldom strong enough to permit the
granting of permission even in exchange for a reasonable fee""); Posner, When Is Parody Fair Use?, 21 J. Legal Studies 67,
73 (1992) (""There is an obstruction when the parodied work is a target of the parodist's criticism, for it may be in the private
interest of the copyright owner, but not in the social interest, to suppress criticism of the work"") (emphasis deleted).

If we keep the definition of parody within these limits, we have gone most of the way towards satisfying the four-factor
[510 U.S. 598]

fair use test in § 107. The first factor (the purpose and character of use) itself concerns the definition of parody. The second
factor (the nature of the copyrighted work) adds little to the first, since ""parodies almost invariably copy publicly known,
expressive works."" Ante, at 586. The third factor (the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the whole) is
likewise subsumed within the definition of parody. In determining whether an alleged parody has taken too much, the target
of the parody is what gives content to the inquiry. Some parodies, by their nature, require substantial copying. See E/smere
Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 623 F. 2d 252 (CA2 1980) (holding that ""| Love Sodom"" skit on ""Saturday Night
Live"" is legitimate parody of the ""| Love New York"" campaign). Other parodies, like Lewis Carroll's ""You Are Old, Father
William,"" need only take parts of the original composition. The third factor does reinforce the principle that courts should not
accord fair use protection to profiteers who do no more than add a few silly words to someone else's song or place the
characters from a familiar work in novel or eccentric poses. See, e. g., Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, 581 F. 2d 751
(CA9 1978) ; DC Comics Inc. v. Unlimited Monkey Business, Inc.,598 F. Supp. 110 (ND Ga. 1984) . But, as | believe the
Court acknowledges, ante, at 588-589, it is by no means a test of mechanical application. In my view, it serves in effect to
ensure compliance with the targeting requirement.

As to the fourth factor (the effect of the use on the market for the original), the Court acknowledges that it is legitimate
for parody to suppress demand for the original by its critical effect. Ante, at 591-592. What it may not do is usurp demand by
its substitutive effect. /bid. It will be difficult, of course, for courts to determine whether harm to the market results from a
parody's critical or substitutive effects. But again, if we keep the definition of parody within appropriate bounds, this inquiry
may be of little significance. If a work targets another for humorous or ironic effect, it is by definition

510 U. S. Reports 599

a new creative work. Creative works can compete with other creative works for the same market, even if their appeal is
overlapping. Factor four thus underscores the importance of ensuring that the parody is in fact an independent creative
work, which is why the parody must ""make some critical comment or statement about the original work which reflects the


--- Page 13 ---
original perspective of the parodist—thereby giving the parody social value beyond its entertainment function."" Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. v. Showcase Atlanta Cooperative Productions, Inc., 479 F. Supp. 351 , 357 (ND Ga. 1979).

The fair use factors thus reinforce the importance of keeping the definition of parody within proper limits. More than
arguable parodic content should be required to deem a would-be parody a fair use. Fair use is an affirmative defense, so
doubts about whether a given use is fair should not be resolved in favor of the self-proclaimed parodist. We should not make
it easy for musicians to exploit existing works and then later claim that their rendition was a valuable commentary on the
original. Almost any revamped modern version of a familiar composition can be construed as a ""comment on the naivete of
the original,"" ante, at 583, because of the difference in style and because it will be amusing to hear how the old tune sounds
in the new genre. Just the thought of a rap version of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or ""Achy Breaky Heart"" is bound to make
people smile. If we allow any weak transformation to qualify as parody, however, we weaken the protection of copyright.
And under-protection of copyright disserves the goals of copyright just as much as overprotection, by reducing the financial
incentive to create.

The Court decides it is ""fair to say that 2 Live Crew's song reasonably could be perceived as commenting on the
original or criticizing it, to some degree."" /bid. (applying the first fair use factor). While | am not so assured that 2 Live Crew's
song is a legitimate parody, the Court's treatment of

510 U. S. Reports 600

the remaining factors leaves room for the District Court to determine on remand that the song is not a fair use. As future
courts apply our fair use analysis, they must take care to ensure that not just any commercial takeoff is rationalized post hoc
as a parody.

With these observations, | join the opinion of the Court.

Before: NEWMAN, JACOBS, Circuit Judges, and KAPLAN, District Judge. *
JACOBS, Circuit Judge:
[883 F.3d 173]

In this copyright infringement suit, defendant TVEyes, Inc. (""TVEyes"") offers a service that enables its clients to easily locate
and view segments of televised video programming that are responsive to the clients' interests. It does so by continuously
recording vast quantities of television programming, compiling the recorded broadcasts into a database that is text-
searchable (based primarily on the closed-captioned text copied from the broadcasts), and allowing its clients to search for
and watch (up to) ten-minute video clips that

[883 F.3d 174]

mention terms of interest to the clients. 1 Plaintiff Fox News Network, LLC (""Fox""), which has sued TVEyes in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, does not challenge the creation of the text-searchable database
but alleges that TVEyes infringed Fox's copyrights by re-distributing Fox's copied audiovisual content, thereby enabling
TVEyes's clients to access that content without Fox's permission. The principal question on appeal is whether TVEyes's
enabling of its clients to watch Fox's programming is protected by the doctrine of fair use. See 17 U.S.C. § 107.

The district court held that fewer than all of the functions of TVEyes's service constitute a fair use. Specifically, the district
court deemed a fair use the functions enabling clients of TVEyes to search for videos by term, to watch the resulting videos,
and to archive the videos on the TVEyes servers; but the court held that certain other functions were not a fair use, such as
those enabling TVEyes's clients to download videos to their computers, to freely e-mail videos to others, or to watch videos
after searching for them by date, time, and channel (rather than by keyword). The district court therefore dismissed Fox's
challenge to important functions of TVEyes's service, but also held that TVEyes was liable to Fox for copyright infringement
on account of other functions of that service. A permanent injunction limited various aspects of TVEyes's service. 2

This appeal shares features with our decision in Authors Guild v. Google. Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 (2d Cir. 2015) (""Google Books
""). That case held that Google's creation of a text-searchable database of millions of books (including books under copyright)
was a fair use because Google's service was ""transformative"" and because integral features protected the rights of copyright
holders. However, we cautioned that the case ""test[ed] the boundaries of fair use."" Google Books, 804 F.3d at 206 . We
conclude that defendant TVEyes has exceeded those bounds.

TVEyes's re-distribution of Fox's audiovisual content serves a transformative purpose in that it enables TVEyes's clients to
isolate from the vast corpus of Fox's content the material that is responsive to their interests, and to access that material in a
convenient manner. But because that re-distribution makes available virtually all of Fox's copyrighted audiovisual content—
including all of the Fox content that TVEyes's clients wish to see and hear—and because it deprives Fox of revenue that
properly belongs to the copyright holder, TVEyes has failed to show that the product it offers to its clients can be justified as
a fair use.

Accordingly, we reverse the order of the district court to the extent it held that some of the challenged TVEyes functions
constituted a fair use. We affirm the order to the extent that it denied TVEyes's request for additional relief. Furthermore,
because the district court's issuance of an injunction was premised on the incorrect conclusion that much of what TVEyes
offered was a fair use, we remand for the district court to revise the injunction in light of this opinion.

l
TVEyes is a for-profit media company. It offers a service that allows its clients to
[883 F.3d 175]

efficiently sort through vast quantities of television content in order to find clips that discuss items of interest to them. For
example, a client in marketing or public relations interested in how a particular product is faring in the media can use the
TVEyes service to find, watch, and share clips of recent television broadcasts that mention that product.

The service works this way. TVEyes records essentially all television broadcasts as they happen, drawing from more than
1,400 channels, recording 24 hours a day, every day. By copying the closed-captioned text that accompanies the content it
records (and utilizing speech-to-text software when necessary), TVEyes creates a text-searchable transcript of the words
spoken in each video. The videos and transcripts are consolidated into a database. A client inputs a search term and gets a
list of video clips that mention the term. A click on a thumbnail image of a clip plays the video, beginning fourteen seconds
before the search term was spoken, and displays a segment of the transcript with the search term highlighted. The parties
dispute the quality of the clips. Fox contends that the clips are high definition; TVEyes contends that the clips are grainier
than the original broadcasts. The clips can be played for no more than ten minutes, but a user can play an unlimited number
of clips. To prevent clients from watching entire programs, TVEyes (during the course of this litigation) implemented a device
that is claimed to prevent clients from viewing consecutive segments. The parties dispute whether this measure is effective.

TVEyes's service has ancillary functions. A TVEyes client may ""archive"" videos permanently on the TVEyes servers and
may download videos directly to the client's computer. These services are useful because TVEyes otherwise deletes
captured content after thirty-two days. Clients can also email the clips for viewing by others, including those who are not
TVEyes clients. And clients can search for videos by date, time, and channel (rather than by keyword). The parties dispute


--- Page 3 ---
whether clients can watch live broadcasts on TVEyes.

A TVEyes subscription costs approximately $500 per month, is available for business and professional use, and is not
offered to private consumers for personal use. Clients include journalists, government and political organizations, law
enforcement, the military, for-profit companies, and non-profits.

TVEyes asserts that it restricts its clients' use of its content in various ways. For example, clients are required to sign a
contract that limits their use of clips to ""internal purposes only"" and are warned upon downloading a clip that it is to be used
for only ""internal review, analysis or research."" Fox contends that these safeguards are ineffective and disputes the
assertion by TVEyes that its service is primarily used for ""internal"" research and analysis.

Fox claims that at some point TVEyes unsuccessfully approached it to procure a license to use Fox programming. Fox
demanded that TVEyes stop using its programming; when TVEyes refused, litigation ensued. The lawsuit focuses on
nineteen copyrighted Fox broadcasts. The legal question is whether TVEyes has a ""fair use"" defense to Fox's copyright
infringement claims. 17 U.S.C. § 107.

I
The Copyright Act provides:

[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work ... for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching ...,
scholarship, or research, is not an infringement

[883 F.3d 176]

of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be
considered shall include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
Id.

In fair use litigation, courts undertake a ""case-by-case analysis"" in which each factor is considered, ""and the results [are]
weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 577-78, 114
S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) . The factors are non-exclusive, but consideration of each is mandatory.3 Swatch Grp.
Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P.. 756 F.3d 73 , 81 (2d Cir. 2014). Some of the factors are more important than others,
with the fourth (market impact) being ""the single most important element."" Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. ,
471 U.S. 539 , 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . Fair use is an affirmative defense, so TVEyes bears the
burden of proving it. Am. Geophysical Union v. Texaco. Inc. , 60 F.3d 913, 918 (2d Cir. 1994).

It is useful to analyze separately distinct functions of the secondary use (i.e., the use by TVEyes of Fox's copyrighted
material), considering whether each independent function is a fair use. See Google Books , 804 F.3d at 216-18 . TVEyes has
two core offerings: the ""Search function"" and the ""Watch function."" The Search function allows clients to identify videos that
contain keywords of interest. The Watch function allows TVEyes clients to view up to ten-minute, unaltered video clips of
copyrighted content. Fox does not challenge the Search function on appeal. Fox's challenge is to the Watch function, and
we determine that its inclusion renders TVEyes's package of services unprotected by the fair use doctrine. That conclusion
subsumes and obviates consideration of certain functions that are subsidiary to the Watch function, such as archiving,
downloading, and emailing the video clips.

Turning to the Watch function, we next consider each of the four factors listed in § 107.
A

In considering the first statutory factor—the ""purpose and character"" of the secondary use, 17 U.S.C. § 107(1) —the primary
inquiry is whether the use ""communicates something new and different from the original or [otherwise] expands its utility,”
that is, whether the use is ""transformative."" Google Books , 804 F.3d at 214 . To be transformative, a use must ""do[ ]
something more than repackage or republish the original copyrighted work""; it must "" ‘add[ ] something new, with a further
purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning or message....’ ""Authors Guild, Inc. v.
HathiTrust_, 755 F.3d 87 , 96 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting

[883 F.3d 177]

Campbell . 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). ""Although ... transformative use is not absolutely necessary for a finding of
fair use, ... [transformative] works ... lie at the heart of the fair use doctrine,"" Campbell , 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ,



--- Page 4 ---
and ""a use of copyrighted material that ‘merely repackages or republishes the original’ is unlikely to be deemed a fair use,""
Infinity Broad. Corp. v. Kirkwood , 150 F.3d 104, 108 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard ,
103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1111 (1990) ).

Precedent is helpful. Both parties rely most heavily on Google Books , which provides the starting point for analysis.

In Google Books , a consortium of libraries collaborated to make digital copies of millions of books, many of them under
copyright. Google pooled these digital copies into a text-searchable database. 804 F.3d at 207 . Anyone could search the
database free. When a user entered a search term, Google returned a list of books that included the term, and, for each
responsive book, Google provided a few ""snippets"" that contained the term. Id.

We held that Google's copying served a transformative purpose because it created a text-searchable database that
""communicate[d] something new and different from the original."" Id. at 214. ""[T]he result of a word search is different in
purpose, character, expression, meaning, and message from the page (and the book) from which it is drawn."" Id. at 217
(quoting HathiTrust, 755 F.3d at 97 ).

We also held that the ""snippet view"" of unaltered, copyrighted text ""add[ed] important value to the basic transformative
search function"" by allowing users to verify that the list of books returned by the database was responsive to the user's
search. Id. Thus, a user searching for the term ""Hindenburg"" could infer from snippets whether the book was referencing the
Weimar president or the exploded zeppelin. See id. at 217-18.

TVEyes's copying of Fox's content for use in the Watch function is similarly transformative insofar as it enables users to
isolate, from an ocean of programming, material that is responsive to their interests and needs, and to access that material
with targeted precision. It enables nearly instant access to a subset of material—and to information about the material—that
would otherwise be irretrievable, or else retrievable only through prohibitively inconvenient or inefficient means.

Sony Corporation of America vs. Universal City Studios, Inc. is instructive. See 464 U.S. 417 , 104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d
574 (1984) . InSony, a television customer, who (by virtue of owning a television set) had acquired authorization to watch a
program when it was broadcast, recorded it in order to watch it instead at a later, more convenient time. That was held to be
a fair use. While Sony was decided before ""transformative"" became a term of art, the apparent reasoning was that a
secondary use may be a fair use if it utilizes technology to achieve the transformative purpose of improving the efficiency of
delivering content without unreasonably encroaching on the commercial entitlements of the rights holder.

The Watch function certainly qualifies as technology that achieves the transformative purpose of enhancing efficiency: it
enables TVEyes's clients to view all of the Fox programming that (over the prior thirty-two days) discussed a particular topic
of interest to them, without having to monitor thirty-two days of programming in order to catch each relevant discussion; and
it eliminates the clients' need even to view entire programs, because the ten most relevant minutes are presented to them.
Much like the television customer in

[883 F.3d 178]

Sony, TVEyes clients can view the Fox programming they want at a time and place that is convenient to them, rather than at
the time and place of broadcast. For these reasons, TVEyes's Watch function is at least somewhat transformative. 4

kK

The first statutory factor also implicates considerations distinct from whether the secondary use is transformative. In
particular, Fox argues that the ""commercial nature"" of TVEyes's copying (its sale of access to Fox's content) weighs against
a finding of fair use. 17 U.S.C. § 107(1).

The commercial nature of a secondary use weighs against a finding of fair use. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 585 , 114 S.Ct.
1164 . And it does so especially when, as here, the transformative character of the secondary use is modestSee id. at 579,
114 S.Ct. 1164 (""[T]he [less] transformative the new work, the [more] will be the significance of other factors, like
commercialism....""). The Watch function has only a modest transformative character because, notwithstanding the
transformative manner in which it delivers content, it essentially republishes that content unaltered from its original form, with
no ""new expression, meaning or message."" HathiTrust , 755 F.3d at 96 (quoting Campbell , 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164
); cf. Kirkwood, 150 F.3d at 106 (service that transmits unaltered radio broadcasts in real time over telephone lines is not
transformative); Video Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista Home Entm't, Inc. , 342 F.3d 191, 199-200 (3d Cir. 2003) (service that
streams short previews of movies without commentary is not transformative). The clients of TVEyes use Fox's news
broadcasts for the same purpose that authorized Fox viewers use those broadcasts—the purpose of learning the information
reported.

The first statutory factor therefore favors TVEyes, albeit slightly.

B

The second statutory factor is ""the nature of the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(2). This factor ""has rarely played a
significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute,"" and it plays no significant role here. Google Books , 804 F.3d at
220.

TVEyes presses the argument that, since facts are not copyrightable, the factual nature of Fox's content militates in favor of


--- Page 5 ---
a finding of fair use. We have rejected this argument: ""Those who report the news undoubtedly create factual works. It
cannot seriously be argued that, for that reason, others may freely copy and re-disseminate news reports."" Id. at 220.

Cc
The third statutory factor is ""the amount and substantiality of the portion
[883 F.3d 179]

used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). The relevant consideration is the amount of
copyrighted material made available to the public rather than the amount of material used by the copier. Google Books, 804
F.3d at 222 .

This factor clearly favors Fox because TVEyes makes available virtually the entirety of the Fox programming that TVEyes

users want to see and hear. While ""courts have rejected any categorical rule that a copying of the entirety cannot be a fair
se,"" ""a finding of fair use is [less] likely ... when the copying is extensive, or encompasses the most important parts of the

original."" Id. at 221. In this respect, the TVEyes Watch function is radically dissimilar to the service at issue in Google Books

Google's snippet function was designed to ensure that users could see only a very small piece of a book's contents. Each
snippet was three lines of text, constituting approximately one-eighth of a page; a viewer could see at most three snippets
per book for any searched term, and no more than one per page. Users were prevented from performing repeated searches
to find multiple snippets that could be compiled into a coherent block of text. Approximately 22% of a book's text was
""placklist[ed]"": no snippet could be shown from those pages. Id. at 222. And snippets were not available at all for such books
as dictionaries or cookbooks, in which a snippet might convey all the information that a searcher was likely to need. While
the snippets allowed a user to judge whether a book was responsive to the user's needs, they were abbreviated to ensure
that it would be nearly impossible for a user to see a meaningful exposition of what the author originally intended to convey
to readers.

TVEyes redistributes Fox's news programming in ten-minute clips, which—given the brevity of the average news segment
on a particular topic—likely provide TVEyes's users with all of the Fox programming that they seek and the entirety of the
message conveyed by Fox to authorized viewers of the original. Cf. Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises.
471 U.S. 539 , 564-65, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (finding no fair use when the copying involved only about
300 words, but the portion copied was ""the heart of the book""). TVEyes's use of Fox's content is therefore both ""extensive""
and inclusive of all that is ""important"" from the copyrighted work. Google Books , 804 F.3d at 221 .

D

The fourth statutory factor is ""the effect of the [secondary] use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). This factor is ""undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use."" Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. . 471 U.S. 539 , 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . It ""focuses on whether the
copy brings to the marketplace a competing substitute for the original, or its derivative, so as to deprive the rights holder of
significant revenues because of the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the
original."" Google Books . 804 F.3d at 223 . Critically, it requires consideration of ""not only the ... market harm caused by the
particular actions of the alleged infringer,"" but also the market harm that would result from ""unrestricted and widespread
conduct of the [same] sort."" Campbell , 510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).

TVEyes argues that its service poses little risk of being a ""competing substitute"" for Fox's offerings.

883 F.3d 180]

Google Books, 804 F.3d at 223 . Fox argues that TVEyes undercuts Fox's ability to profit from licensing searchable access
0 its copyrighted content to third parties. Fox has much the stronger point.

""It is indisputable that, as a general matter, a copyright holder is entitled to demand a royalty for licensing others to use its
copyrighted work, and that the impact on potential licensing revenues is a proper subject for consideration in assessing the
ourth factor."" Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. , 448 F.3d 605 , 614 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Texaco, 60 F.3d at
929 ). However, ""not every effect on potential licensing revenues enters the analysis under the fourth factor."" Texaco, 60
F.3d at 929 . A copyright owner has no right to demand that users take a license unless the use that would be made is one
hat would otherwise infringe an exclusive right. See Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 615 . Even if a use does infringe an
exclusive right, ""[o]nly an impact on potential licensing revenues for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets
should be legally cognizable when evaluating a secondary use's effect upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work."" Texaco, 60 F.3d at 930 (internal quotation marks omitted).

That limitation does not restrict our analysis here. The success of the TVEyes business model demonstrates that deep-
pocketed consumers are willing to pay well for a service that allows them to search for and view selected television clips,
and that this market is worth millions of dollars in the aggregate. Consequently, there is a plausibly exploitable market for
such access to televised content, and it is proper to consider whether TVEyes displaces potential Fox revenues when
TVEyes allows its clients to watch Fox's copyrighted content without Fox's permission.

Such displacement does occur. Since the ability to re-distripute Fox's content in the manner that TVEyes does is clearly of


--- Page 6 ---
value to TVEyes, it (or a similar service) should be willing to pay Fox for the right to offer the content. By providing Fox's
content to TVEyes clients without payment to Fox, TVEyes is in effect depriving Fox of licensing revenues from TVEyes or
from similar entities. And Fox itself might wish to exploit the market for such a service rather than license it to others.
TVEyes has thus ""usurp[ed] a market that properly belongs to the copyright-holder."" Kirkwood . 150 F.3d at 110 . It is of no
moment that TVEyes allegedly approached Fox for a license but was rebuffed: the failure to strike a deal satisfactory to both
parties does not give TVEyes the right to copy Fox's copyrighted material without payment.

In short, by selling access to Fox's audiovisual content without a license, TVEyes deprives Fox of revenues to which Fox is
entitled as the copyright holder. Therefore, the fourth factor favors Fox.

E

To ascertain whether TVEyes's service is protected as a fair use, the final step is to weigh the four statutory factors together,
along with any other relevant considerations. The factors should not be ""treated in isolation, one from another""; rather, ""[a]ll
are to be explored, and the results [are to be] weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."" Campbell _ 510 U.S. at
577-78 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . While the factors are not exclusive, in this case they provide sufficient guidanceSee Kirkwood

150 F.3d at111.

We conclude that TVEyes's service is not justifiable as a fair use. As to the first factor, TVEyes's Watch function is at least
somewhat transformative in that it renders convenient and efficient access to a subset

[883 F.3d 181]

of content; however, because the function does little if anything to change the content itself or the purpose for which the
content is used, its transformative character is modest at best. Accordingly—and because the service at issue is commercial
—the first factor favors TVEyes only slightly. The second factor is neutral in this case. The third factor strongly favors Fox
because the Watch function allows TVEyes's clients to see and hear virtually all of the Fox programming that they wish. And
the fourth factor favors Fox as well because TVEyes has usurped a function for which Fox is entitled to demand
compensation under a licensing agreement.

At bottom, TVEyes is unlawfully profiting off the work of others by commercially re-distributing all of that work that a viewer
wishes to use, without payment or license. Having weighed the required factors, we conclude that the balance strongly
favors Fox and defeats the defense of fair use.

TVEyes challenges the district court's conclusion that it is liable to Fox under a theory of direct copyright infringement. 5A
direct infringer exercises ""volitional conduct"" to make the infringing copy. Cartoon Network LP, LLLP v. CSC Holdings, Inc.
(""Cablevision"") , 536 F.3d 121 , 131 (2d Cir. 2008). The conduct at issue inCablevision was non-volitional; however, it bears
no resemblance to what TVEyes does. The Cablevision defendant provided a remote DVR service similar to the recording
capability of a DVR in a television viewer's home. Unless the subscriber chose to record a program, it remained on the
defendant's server for no more than .1 second. See id. at 124-25. By contrast, TVEyes decides what audiovisual content to
record, copies that content, and retains it for thirty-two days. And this copying, at least to the extent that it is done to enable
the Watch function, is an infringement. Volitional conduct that infringes is clear.

IV

The district court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting TVEyes from enabling its clients to download clips of Fox's
programming or to search for such clips by date and time; the court also imposed restrictions on TVEyes's enabling of its
clients to email clips or to post them to social media sites. We review the issuance of a permanent injunction ""for abuse of
discretion, which may be found where the Court, in issuing the injunction, relied on ... an error of law."" S.C. Johnson & Son
Inc. v. Clorox Co. , 241 F.3d 232 , 237 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Knox v. Salinas , 193 F.3d 123, 128-29 (2d Cir. 1999) (per
curiam) ).

The district court's injunction was shaped by an error of law: the mistaken assumption that the Watch function (and some
features subsidiary to it) had fair-use protection. We therefore remand to the district court to revise the injunction in
accordance with this opinion.

Because the product TVEyes currently offers includes the infringing Watch function and its subsidiary features (i.e., clients’
ability to archive, download, and email clips, as well as to view clips after

[883 F.3d 182]

conducting a date/time search ©), the court should enjoin TVEyes from offering that product. However, because Fox does
not dispute TVEyes's right to offer its Search function, the court's injunction shall not bar TVEyes from offering a product that
includes that function without making impermissible use of any protected audiovisual content. 2

CONCLUSION

The order of the district court is reversed to the extent it held that TVEyes's product was a fair use. The order is affirmed to


--- Page 7 ---
the extent it denied TVEyes's request for additional relief. We remand for the district court to revise the injunction to conform
with this opinion. Any further appeal will be assigned to this panel.

Kaplan, District Judge, * concurring:

| concur in the result as well as part |, the preamble to part Il, and parts II.B, III and IV of the majority opinion. With great
respect for my learned and distinguished colleagues, however, | do not join in their characterization of TVEyes' Watch
function as ""somewhat transformative."" | decline for two reasons.

First, although the majority writes that it ""is at least somewhat transformative,"" it holds that the Watch function nevertheless
is not a fair use of Fox's copyrighted material. Stated differently, it holds that the other factors relevant to the fair use
determination carry the day in favor of Fox regardless of whether the Watch function is or is not transformative. The
""somewhat transformative"" characterization therefore is entirely immaterial to the resolution of this case—in a familiar

phrase, it is obitur dictum .11 would avoid any such characterization even if | agreed with it.

Second, while | prefer not to state a view as to whether the Watch function is transformative, | would be remiss, given the
majority's opinion, if | did not express my doubt that the majority's view is correct. To the contrary, were we compelled to
reach the point, | would be inclined to conclude that it is not.

/

| do not suggest that this or any appellate court should ""purge dictum from [its] opinions."" 2 But there are situations in which
sound prudential reasons counsel against making statements that are ""superfluous to the court's performance of its
function."" 21 submit that this is one of them.

[883 F.3d 183]

1. ""[T]he goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works.
Such works thus lie at the heart of the fair use doctrine[ ].""4""[T]he more transformative the new work, the less will be the
significance of other factors."" 5It therefore is not at all surprising that attempts by alleged infringers to characterize their uses
of copyrighted works as ""transformative"" have become a key battleground in copyright litigation, particularly as technological
advances provide ever-new contexts in which the uncompensated use of copyrighted works is very attractive. And the law
governing such controversies often is far from clear. As noted commentators have observed, courts ""appear to label a use
‘not transformative’ as a shorthand for ‘not fair,’ and correlatively ‘transformative’ for ‘fair.’ Such a strategy empties the term
of meaning."" £ Indeed, as will appear, some of our own decisions on the issue are at least in tension with one another. Z

In these circumstances, a finding of transformative use, while ""not absolutely necessary for a finding of fair use,"" Sis ""of
crucial importance to the fair use analysis."" 2 And as the issue of fair use, in the words of a distinguished panel of this Court
hat remain apt despite intervening years, is ""the most troublesome in the whole law of copyright,"" it is one that ""ought not to
be resolved in cases where it may turn out to be moot, unless the advantage is very plain."" 12 The majority's unnecessary
characterization of the Watch function as ""somewhat transformative"" has no ""advantage,"" let alone one that is ""very plain.""
Indeed, | fear it may contribute to confusion and uncertainty regarding this central concept in the law of fair use. Moreover, it
hreatens to do so in circumstances in which there is no realistic possibility of further appellate review. 1 The determination
of the transformative use issue should be left for a case in which the question necessarily is presented.

2. The advisability of expressing a view as to whether the Watch function is ""transformative"" is diminished further because
his case passes judgment on a technological innovation. New efficiency-enhancing content delivery technologies that will
seek to distribute copyrighted material owned by others doubtless now or soon will exist. Indeed, the efficiency
enhancement that the Watch function allegedly provides appears to be, or to have become at least partly, available from
Internet-based television subscription services to which Fox News presumably licenses its content. 12

883 F.3d 184]

Given (a) the rapid pace of technological change, (b) the importance of the concept of transformative purpose in fair use
jurisprudence, and (c) the fact that it is unnecessary to address the question in this case, | respectfully disagree with the
majority's decision to express a view as to whether the Watch function is transformative.

i]

In view of the majority's expression of its opinion that the Watch function is ""somewhat transformative,"" | feel compelled to
express my own doubts regarding that conclusion.

1. The majority's opinion begins its analysis by observing, correctly in my view, that ""[i]t is useful to analyze separately
distinct functions of the secondary use (i.e., the use by TVEyes of Tox's copyrighted material), considering whether each
independent function is a fair use."" 13 It then turns to the distinction between the Search function and the Watch function.
The Search function ""allows clients to identify videos that contain keywords of interest"" 14—it ""enables users to isolate, from
an ocean of programming, material that is responsive to their interests."" ‘5 The Watch function, in contrast, ""allows TVEyes
clients to view up to ten-minute, unaltered video clips of copyrighted content."" 181n short, the Search function, which is not
challenged here, is simply a vehicle that locates Fox's copyrighted works among other works of interest—it finds the desired


--- Page 8 ---
species of fish in the majority's metaphorical sea. But the Watch function then catches those fish and delivers them to the
fishmonger's stall where TVEyes lays them unchanged (one might say untransformed) on cracked ice for the inspection of
its patrons.

Metaphor aside, the majority then proceeds to test the Watch function, “consider[ing] each of the four [fair use] factors."" 12 It
describes our decision in Google Books , +8 noting that we there ""held that the ‘snippet view’ of unaltered, copyrighted text
‘add[ed] important value to the basic transformative search function’ by allowing users to verify that the list of books returned
by the database was responsive to the user's search."" 12 And it then goes on to say:

[883 F.3d 185]

""TVEyes's copying of Fox's content for use in the Watch function is similarly transformative insofar as it enables
users to isolate, from an ocean of programming, material that is responsive to their interests and needs, and to
access that material with targeted precision. It enables nearly instant access to a subset of material-and to
information about the material-that would otherwise be irretrievable, or else retrievable only through prohibitively
inconvenient or inefficient means."" 2°

But, as the majority itself wrote earlier, it is the Search function that enables users to identify the desired fish in the ocean,
not the Watch function. What the Watch function does is to enable instant access to digital recordings of Fox's content that
have been identified by the Search function. And the majority's justification for concluding that the Watch function is
""somewhat transformative"" is that it ""improvers] the efficiency of delivering content."" 2+

2.1 am inclined to reject the idea that enhancing the efficiency with which copies of copyrighted material are delivered to
secondary issuers, in the context in which the Watch function does so, is transformative.

The concept of transformation is a relatively recent addition to copyright jurisprudence, but its antecedents have been
around for a long time.

In 1841, Justice Story said that ""no one can doubt that a reviewer may fairly cite largely from the original work, if his design
be really and truly to use the passages for the purposes of fair and reasonable criticism,"" but use that ""supersede[s] the
original work"" is not fair. 22 Building on that idea, Judge Leval's landmark article, which later was adopted substantially by the
Supreme Court in the Pretty Woman case, 23 said:

""| believe the answer to the question of justification turns primarily on whether, and to what extent, the
challenged use is transformative. The use must be productive and must employ the quoted matter in a different
manner or for a different purpose from the original. A quotation of copyrighted material that merely repackages or
republishes the original is unlikely to pass the test; in Justice Story's words, it would merely ‘supersede the
objects’ of the original. If on the other hand, the secondary use adds value to the original—if the quoted matters
is used as raw material, transformed in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and
understandings—this is the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of
society.

Transformative uses may include criticizing the quoted work, exposing the character of the original author,
proving a fact, or summarizing an idea argued in the original in order to defend or rebut it. They may also include
parody, symbolism, aesthetic declarations, and innumerable other uses."" 24

Even on the majority's view that TVEyes' Watch function substantially improves the efficiency with which TVEyes customers
can access Fox copyrighted broadcasts of possible interest, it does no more than repackage and deliver the original

[883 F.3d 186]

works. It adds no new information, no new aesthetics, and no new insights or understandings. | therefore doubt that it is
transformative. Indeed, | regard Infinity Broadcast Corp. v. Kirkwood as having settled the question whether a use is
transformative simply because it is more efficient or convenient than what preceded it. 25

In that case, the defendant, Kirkwood, offered a service through which a Kirkwood customer, regardless of its physical
location, could dial a Kirkwood device over a phone line, tune to the radio station of its choice in any of the nation's 10
largest radio markets, and listen to the broadcast of its chosen station. Kirkwood marketed the service to ""radio stations,
advertisers, talent scouts, and others"" for purposes such as ""auditioning on-air talent, verifying the broadcast of
commercials, and listing to a station's programming format and feel."" 28 No doubt Kirkwood's service was convenient and
efficiency-enhancing. It enabled interested clients who, by reason of distance, could not receive the radio stations of interest
to them to (a) access those stations through Kirkwood, (b) listen to their broadcasts over telephone lines and (c) do so for
reasons that, at least in many cases, had nothing to do with the purposes for which local listeners tuned their radios to their
stations of choice. Nevertheless, this Court rejected Kirkwood's fair use defense, stating that there was a ""total absence of
transformativeness"" in Kirkwood's retransmission of the broadcasts. 2” And the Watch function at issue here is essentially
indistinguishable in principle.

We rejected the argument that convenience of accessing copyrighted material is a transformative purpose in American
Geophysical Union, el al. v. Texaco 28 as well. That involved photocopying of scientific journal articles for use in laboratories.


--- Page 9 ---
Texaco there argued that ""its conversion of the individual [journal] articles through photocopying into a form more easily
used in a laboratory might constitute transformative use."" 22 Notwithstanding the fact that the photocopies often were more
convenient or efficient than, for example, buying, borrowing, shelving and carrying about bound volumes of journals, we
wrote that ""Texaco's photocopying merely transforms the material object embodying the intangible article that is the
copyrighted original work. Texaco's making of copies cannot properly be regarded as a transformative use of the
copyrighted material."" 3°

Also closely aligned with this case are others that dealt with technologies relating to digitized music, mp3s, and music
sharing. Defendants in those cases argued that their technologies should be considered fair use because they permitted
""space-shifting""—they allowed users to store music in different, more convenient forms that allowed them to listen to it in
venues more desirable to them. 24 In other words, the technology enhanced efficiency and convenience. But courts
presented with this argument either rejected the idea that space-shifting is a transformative purpose or considered the
space-shifting argument

[883 F.3d 187]
relevant only to the question of the commercial nature of the use. 22

These cases support my inclination to conclude that a technological means that delivers copies of copyrighted material to a
secondary user more quickly, efficiently or conveniently does not render the distribution of those copies transformative, at
least standing alone.

Nor does Google Books support the conclusion that efficiency-enhancing delivery technology is transformative in the
circumstances of this case. Google Books, like this case, involved two features: a searchable database and the display of
""snippets"" from the books containing the search term. 23 We held that copying the books to enable the search function had
he transformative purpose of ""identifying books of interest to the searcher."" That purpose was different than the purpose of
he books themselves, which served to convey their content to the reader, and it constituted fair use. 34 We held also that the
snippets—""horizontal segment[s] comprising ordinarily an eighth of a page""—""add[ed] importantly to the highly
ransformative purpose of identifying books of interest to the searcher."" 5 But Google Books does not resolve this case.

Google designed the snippet feature ""in a manner that substantially protects against its serving as an effectively competing
substitute for Plaintiffs’ books,"" employing safeguards such as ""blacklisting"" (making permanently unavailable for snippet
view one snippet per page and one complete page out of every ten) and showing no snippets at all from the sorts of books
or which a short snippet would represent all the content a searcher wanted to see (such as dictionaries and cookbooks). 3&
Here, on the other hand, the Watch function shows ten minute clips, and parties can play unlimited numbers of ten minute
clips. Certainly a ten minute clip in many, perhaps most, situations suffices for a user to view an entire news segment. And in
situations in which that is not the case, the parties dispute the effectiveness of a preventive measure TVEyes introduced
during the course of this litigation to stop users from watching consecutive clips. 32 Given the posture of this case—review of
a summary judgment decision adverse to Fox on this point—we must view the facts presented by Fox as true and therefore
base our decision on the premise that users may access all of Fox's content by stringing clips together. 38

[883 F.3d 188]

The facts here thus differ from Google Books quite substantially. The snippet function considered there delivered much less
copyrighted content than the Watch function at issue here. Nevertheless, we there concluded that the snippet function only
""adds"" to the transformative purpose of the Search function. Our conclusion with respect to the Google Books snippet
feature therefore does not control the proper characterization of the Watch function at issue here. Moreover, we cautioned in
Google Books that the case ""test[ed] the boundaries of fair use."" 32

3. Nor am Ipersuaded by the majority's reliance on Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc . 4°

Sony considered a claim that the manufacturer of Betamax video recorders was liable for contributory copyright infringement
because its sale of the recorders facilitated copyright infringement by consumers by virtue of the consumers’ recording of
copyrighted broadcasts to enable them to view the programs at times more convenient to them. 4 The Court rejected the
contributory infringement claim, essentially on the bases that (a) substantial numbers of copyright holders would not object
to the consumers' use of the Sony equipment for ""time shifting,"" and (b) the plaintiffs had failed to prove any likelihood of
consequent economic harm. 42

The majority here reads Sony as reasoning ""that a secondary use may be a fair use if it utilizes transformative technology to
improve the efficiency of delivering content."" 42 But Sony was decided before Judge Leval's article introduced the concept of
transformative use or purpose into the copyright lexicon. “+ thus find what Sony teaches about transformative purpose, if
anything, to be less than perfectly clear. | certainly do not find within Sony the idea that efficiency-enhancing technology is
transformative.

The efficiency enhancement at issue in Sony was ""time-shifting""—the use by a consumer of a Betamax device to record a
broadcast so that the consumer could watch that show at a later, presumably more convenient, time. 48 The Court asked
whether time-shifting was a substantial noninfringing use; the answer to that question determined whether Sony could be
liable for contributory infringement. 48 It was in that context that the Court found that unauthorized time shifting—consumers


--- Page 10 ---
recording copyrighted shows without authorization to watch the shows once at a
[883 F.3d 189]
later time—was ""not necessarily infringing."" 42

The Court's discussion of time-shifting focused on the non-commercial nature of in-home recording: ""[R]espondents failed to
demonstrate that time-shifting would cause any likelihood of nonminimal harm to the potential market for, or the value of,
their copyrighted works. The Betamax is, therefore, capable of substantial noninfringing uses. Sony's sale of such
equipment to the general public does not constitute contributory infringement of respondent's copyrights."" 48

Perhaps the Court in Sony would have found efficiency-enhancing technology to be transformative for that reason alone had

that argument been put to it. But | see no indication of that in the opinion. Rather, Sony turned on the question whether
""time-shifting,"" on the facts presented in that case, was a commercial use that affected the broadcasters’ ability to make a
profit in the market. And the Court so concluded without considering, at least explicitly, whether the recordings served a
purpose different from the original broadcasts. In fact, the Court said that ""timeshifting merely enables a viewer to see such
a work which he had been invited to witness."" 42In other words, time-shifting allows a user to do exactly that which the user
could have done with the original: watch the show for whatever entertainment, informational or other purpose it serves. No

new purpose had been added. So | hesitate to conclude that Sony mandates, or even suggests, the idea that efficiency-
enhancing technology is transformative.

My hesitation in this regard is strengthened by this Court's subsequent treatment of Sony. No prior opinion of this Court
says, or even suggests, that Sony stands for the proposition that time-shifting in particular, or efficiency-enhancing delivery
technology in general, is transformative. In Swatch Group Management Services Ltd v. Bloomberg L.P., we described Sony
as a decision ""finding a non-transformative use to be a fair use."" ©° Infinity Broadcast Corp. described Sony's discussion of
time-shifting as a ""determination] that time-shifting of television programs by consumers in their homes was a non-
commercial use."" 5‘ Indeed, as noted, we there held that an efficiency promoting technology was not transformative and
gave no sign that Sony was relevant to that conclusion.

Similarly, Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust 52 and Google Books 53.cite Sony for various principles, but never for the
proposition that efficiency-enhancing technology is transformative, despite that idea's obvious potential application in those
cases. Because HathiTrust and Google Books so clearly confront an issue closely related to that here, | see as instructive
their omission of the idea that Sony declared efficiency-enhancing delivery technology to be transformative. | would join
those cases in declining to construe Sony as offering significant guidance regarding transformative use.

In sum, Sony's relevance to transformative use is, at best, unclear. | decline to

[883 F.3d 190]
join in the majority's novel interpretation of Sony.
Ml

For the foregoing reasons, | concur in the judgment of this Court and in part |, the preamble to part Il, and parts II.B, Ill and
IV of the majority opinion. | decline to join in part II.A and its characterization of the Watch function as ""somewhat
transformative.""

1TVEyes also captures radio content. For simplicity, this opinion will focus on only television broadcasts.

2 Fox does not challenge on appeal the dismissal (on summary judgment) of its claims alleging ""hot news"" misappropriation and ""direct competition""
misappropriation.

3 Pace Judge Kaplan's argument that our discussion of transformative use (which is integral to the first statutory factor) should be omitted from the fair-
use analysis—or be deemed dicta. Whether the majority opinion's discussion ""may contribute to confusion and uncertainty"" (Concurring Op. at 183) is
not for me to say.

4TVEyes argues that the Watch function is transformative because it allows clients to conduct research and analysis of television content by enabling
them to view clips responsive to their research needs. Research, TVEyes argues, is a purpose not shared by users of the original content. This argument
proves too much.

That a secondary use can facilitate research does not itself support a finding that the secondary use is transformative. See American Geophysical Union
v. Texaco, Inc. , 60 F.3d 913 (2d Cir. 1994) . In Texaco, a company was allowing each of its 400 to 500 scientists to photocopy journal articles pertinent
to their individual research projects, thus enabling three subscriptions to service the needs of hundreds of scientists. Id. at 915-16. We stated that if
copying were deemed transformative ""simply because [it was done] in the course of doing research,"" then ""the concept of a ‘transformative’ use would
be extended beyond recognition."" Id. at 924.

5A party that has not committed direct copyright infringement may still be liable under the doctrine of contributory infringement, which allows a defendant
to be held liable for infringing acts of third parties. See Sony . 464 U.S. at 435 , 104 S.Ct. 774 ; Arista Records. LLC v. Doe 3 . 604 F.3d 110 , 117-18 (2d
Cir. 2010). Fox asserted liability only on the ground of direct infringement, so we do not consider contributory infringement.

& There is no copyright infringement in the use of the date/time search function to discover the particular program that was playing on a certain channel at
a certain time. That information is a historical fact, which is not copyrightable. See Arica Institute, Inc. v. Palmer , 970 F.2d 1067 , 1075 (2d Cir. 1992).
However, enabling a client to view a copied video located on the basis of a date/time search can constitute infringement, and it is not a fair use.

2 Because Fox has not challenged the Search function on this appeal, and the parties have therefore presented no arguments about it, we express no
views on it, neither upholding nor rejecting it.

12] understand that Internet-based cable subscription services now available allow a subscriber to record cable shows, store (some with limits on the
amount that can be stored, some without), and re-watch those shows within a certain time frame (for example, within nine months of the recording). See
Eric Liston, How to Watch Fox News Without Cable—Your Top 5 Options, Flixed (Dec. 6, 2017), https://flixed.io/watch-fox-news-without-cable/. Someone
who wanted to ""monitor"" Fox News could DVR (i.e., direct video record) all Fox News shows using these paid services. Upon using TVEyes's Search
function—the transformative nature of which was not challenged—to identify when a term was said in a broadcast, the user could click directly to that
portion of the broadcast and watch it immediately online using their paid subscription service. It is unclear whether these services as they currently exist
would allow a user to monitor all local broadcasts throughout the country, but they certainly diminish the Watch function's convenience value.

And technology will march on, perhaps soon eliminating altogether the efficiency the majority claims renders the Watch function
transformative.

| recognize, of course, that there appears to be no discussion of these services in the record. This is at least partially attributable to the fact
that the advent of some of these services post-dates this litigation. But this demonstrates handily the point that technology is rapidly
evolving, which is all the more reason to decline to pronounce a piece of technology transformative when it is not necessary to do so.

Before NEWMAN, MAYER, AND PLAGER, Circuit Judges. NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.

The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed with prejudice the complaint filed by Dr.
George Pieczenik, on the ground that he failed to state a

Page 3

claim on which relief could be granted, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Dr. Pieczenik appeals that dismissal. He also appeals the
dismissal of his charge of copyright infringement by the defendants’ quotation from his classroom lecture; he appeals the
denial of his request for compulsory mediation; and he appeals Judge Pisano's denial of the request that Judge Pisano
recuse from this case. On review, we affirm the district court's judgment and rulings.

BACKGROUND

Dr. Pieczenik is the inventor and owner of United States Patent No. 5,866,363 (the '363 patent) entitled ""Method and
Means for Sorting and Identifying Biological Information."" Proceeding pro se, Dr. Pieczenik initiated this suit by filing four
separate complaints in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, against a total of eighty-eight
defendants. He alleged that more than one hundred named and unnamed parties infringe one or more claims of the '363
patent, and that some defendants also violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. Several
defendants filed motions to dismiss. While those motions were pending, the district court sua sponte dismissed without
prejudice Dr. Pieczenik's four complaints for failure to meet the minimum pleading requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. The district court provided Dr. Pieczenik with an opportunity to correct the defects by filing a single consolidated
complaint that met the requirements of the Federal Rules.

Dr. Pieczenik then filed a consolidated amended complaint. All eighty-eight defendants moved to dismiss the complaint
for failure to meet the requirements of Rule 12(b)(6) in accordance with the standards explained in Bell Atlantic v. Twombly.
550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 129 S.Ct. 1937 (2009) . The district

Page 4

court granted the motion, stating that ""Plaintiff has failed to state a plausible claim of infringement against any Defendant.""
Op. 12. The court dismissed the infringement claims in their entirety, and also dismissed the RICO claims, stating that Dr.
Pieczenik failed to ""allege any statutorily-defined racketeering activities or a pattern of the same,"" and that he did not have
standing to bring a RICO action. Op. 15.

The procedural criteria of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) are reviewed in accordance with the procedural law of the
relevant regional circuit, here the Third Circuit, with Supreme Court guidance as appropriate. See CoreBrace LLC v. Star
Seismic LLC, 566 F.3d 1069 , 1072 (Fed.Cir.2009) (""The question whether a Rule 12(b)(6) motion was properly granted is a
purely procedural question not pertaining to patent law, to which this court applies the rule of the regional [ ] circuit."")
(internal quotation omitted). To withstand dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) the plaintiff has an ""obligation to provide the
grounds of his entitlement to relief."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 . This obligation ""requires more than labels and conclusions. .
. . Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all the
allegations in the complaint are true."" /d. (internal citations omitted). Dismissal is appropriate ""only if, accepting all factual
allegations as true and construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we determine that the plaintiff is

In general, pro se litigants are held to a lesser standard than pleadings drafted by lawyers when determining whether a
complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5 , 9-10 (1980). However,

THE INFRINGEMENT COUNTS

The district court held that Dr. Pieczenik's amended complaint did not allege facts sufficient to support his claim for
infringement of the '363 patent. Dr. Pieczenik states that the '363 patent covers ""random nucleotide libraries . . . [and]
monoclonal and polyclonal libraries."" Pieczenik Am. Compl. 13. The complaint states that the '363 patent is infringed by
defendant Invitrogen's sale of ""vectors for the display of combinatorial libraries"" and ""DynaBeads for Phage Display and
BioPanning,"" id. at 40; and by the purchase of combinatorial libraries produced by New England Biolabs by forty-one named

USA Holdings, Inc., Shionogi USA, Inc., Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc., and Syngenta Seeds, Inc. The complaint does not
identify any infringing product or process that is or was made, used or sold by any of the remaining defendants.

The district court determined that Dr. Pieczenik did not identify infringing activity by any defendant in connection with
the New England Biolabs libraries. The complaint states that these defendants purchased ""combinatorial peptide phage
display libraries"" sold by New England Bio-labs, but does not state how these libraries and their purchase infringe the '363
patent. Pieczenik Am. Compl. 15. The district court correctly held that the minimal pleading requirements of patent
infringement were not met For Invitrogen, the district court observed that the complaint does not recite facts sufficient to
show that Invitrogen's product is a ""library"" covered by the '363 patent. The district court held that Dr. Pieczenik's complaint
did not meet the minimum pleading standards. Dr. Pieczenik argues that the district court erred in dismissing his counts of
patent infringement. As ""evidence of infringement,” he states: ""The fact that amino acid sequence SER-VAL-SER-VAL-GLY-
MET-LYS-PRO-SER-PRO-ARG-PRO was isolated and made by several defendants came out of the combinatorial library
claimed in Plaintiff-Appellant's '363 patent."" Pieczenik Br. 1. He does not discuss the criteria of patent infringement or
identify which of the named defendants isolated or made the asserted sequence. Instead, Dr. Pieczenik argues that
because the '363 patent has a ""§102(e) filing date of August 28, 1985"" and a ""document disclosure filing of 1983,"" ""the court
can only use rulings that are prior to 1983 or 1985 at the latest to determine any gatekeeping functions in determining
sufficient evidence to commence a patent infringement action."" /d. This reasoning is obscure,

Page 7

for the Federal Rules have consistently required the plaintiff to ""give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and
the grounds upon which it rests,""Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 , 47 (1957). If such grounds do not exist or are not fairly
noticed in the complaint, the complaint will be dismissed. See Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203 , 210 (3d Cir. 2009)
(""To prevent dismissal, all civil complaints must now set out 'sufficient factual matter’ to show that the claim is facially
plausible.""). No error has been shown in the district court's rulings as to the inadequacy of the complaint's recitation of the
basis for the charges that any or all of the forty-one listed defendants infringed the '323 patent by purchasing libraries from
NEB; that Invitrogen infringed the '323 patent through its sale of vectors for the display of combinatorial libraries and
DynaBeads; or that any other defendant infringed the '323 patent by making, using, or selling any other product or process
covered by the patent's claims.

ll
THE RACKETEERING COUNTS

The district court held that Dr. Pieczenik did not allege any law or fact sufficient to support a racketeering count against
any defendant. The complaint did not specify how the RICO statute was violated by any defendant, as required by 18 U.S.C.
§1962, and did not allege any injury as a result of any defendant's alleged RICO violation. See Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d
472 , 483 (3d Cir. 2000) (""[A] RICO plaintiff [must] make two related but analytically distinct threshold showings . . . : (1) that
the plaintiff suffered an injury to business or property; and (2) that the plaintiff's injury was proximately caused by the
defendant's violation of 18 U.S.C. §1962.""). We affirm the district court's ruling that the complaint did not meet the minimum
plead-

Page 8
ing requirements for violation of the RICO statute, as to any defendant.

lll
MOTIONS

A. Recusal

Dr. Pieczenik appeals from Judge Pisano's denial of his motion for recusal. Dr. Pieczenik recited seven grounds for
recusal: (1) the possibility that Judge Pisano holds shares in any of the defendant public companies; (2) Judge Pisano's
alleged favoritism toward opposing counsel; (3) Judge Pis-ano's denial of requested discovery; (4) Judge Pisano's failure to
hold a Markman hearing; (5) Judge Pisano's ""hidden agenda"" as evidenced by consolidation of the four original actions into
a single action; (6) Judge Pisano's failure to remove Milbank Tweed Hadley McCloy LLP as pro hac vice counsel in this


--- Page 4 ---
matter; and (7) Judge Pisano's prejudices against pro se litigants, against Jewish litigants, against ""scientists acting as
lawyers,"" against inventors who litigate their patents, and against science generally. Dr. Pieczenik also objected to the
court's remark at the hearing that Dr. Pieczenik had commenced other litigation in the past.

The district court pointed out that Dr. Pieczenik did not provide a factual basis for any of his accusations, and held that
there was no basis for any belief that his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, citing 28 U.S.C. §455(a), that there
was no basis for the charge that he had a personal bias or prejudice against Dr. Pieczenik, or that he had personal
knowledge of any disputed facts concerning the proceeding, citing 28 U.S.C. §144. Judge Pisano observed that the motion
for recusal ""consists merely of speculation

Page 9

and unsupported assertions of bias and prejudice."" Op. 6. We review a recusal decision for abuse of discretion. Secu-
racomm Consulting, Inc. v. Securacom Inc., 224 F.3d 273 , 278 (3d Cir. 2000); United States v. Wilensky, 757 F.2d 594 ,
599-600 (3d Cir. 1985).

In accordance with 28 U.S.C. §144, recusal is required upon a ""sufficient affidavit"" that the judge has a personal bias or
prejudice against the party seeking recusal or in favor of an adverse party. Dr. Pieczenik has not submitted an affidavit, and
his motion does not state any facts to support his allegations. Dr. Pieczenik has not shown any basis for questioning Judge
Pisano's impartiality, in view of 28 U.S.C. §455(a), or that Judge Pisano is or may be personally biased or prejudiced against
Dr. Pieczenik. We affirm the district court's denial of the recusal motion.

B. Copyright Infringement

Dr. Pieczenik filed a ""Motion in Limine to Expunge Plaintiffs Copyrighted Lectures Proffered by Defendants' Counsel
and to Charge Them with Digital Copyright Infringement."" Dr. Pieczenik states that the defendants violated his copyright by
quoting, in their brief, statements made by Dr. Pieczenik during a lecture to a biochemistry class at Rutgers University,
relating to the ease and benefits of pro se litigation in federal court. The defendants cited these statements to support the
argument that Dr. Piec-zenik was familiar with suing in federal court and should not be entitled to the more lenient pleading
standards afforded to pro se litigants.

The district court held that ""the Defendants’ use of the statements was proper and, to the extent Plaintiff holds a
copyright as to such material, Defendants did not infringe any such copyright."" Order 1, Dec. 2, 2010. We agree that if

Page 10

there were a copyright of the lecture material; this was a fair use of the quotation. The Copyright Act provides guidance for
determining fair use, as follows:

17 U.S.C. §107. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be
considered shall include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all
the above factors.

The ""fairness"" of a particular use is determined on a case-by-case basis, applying an ""equitable rule of reason
analysis."" Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 448 (1984). Applying the statutory factors, the
defendants' quotation from the lecture was not for commercial purpose, and there is no assertion that the defendants' use
adversely affected Dr. Pieczenik's interests in or the value of the material. The quoted statements are of possible relevance
to this lawsuit, and the defendants’ use of this material falls readily within the boundaries of fair use. See Shell v. DeVries,
No. 07-1086, 2007 WL 4269047 (10th Cir. 2007) (finding fair use when a party copied ten pages from the plaintiff's website
to use in litigation).

The district court correctly held that Dr. Pieczenik had not stated the premises of a claim for copyright infringe-
Page 11
ment, and that the lecture need not be expunged from the record.
C. Compulsory Mediation
Dr. Pieczenik requested that the district court compel mediation by each of the defendants individually, and states that

the district court erred in denying this request. In denying the motion, the district court stated that the defendants ""[had] no
interest in mediation, particularly given that currently pending before the Court is a motion by Defendants to dismiss the


--- Page 5 ---
amended complaint."" Order 2, Dec. 2, 2010.

Whether to compel mediation is within the district court's discretion, and is reviewed accordingly. See Pierce v.
Underwood, 487 U.S. 552 , 559 n.1 (1988) (""It is especially common for issues involving what can broadly be labeled
‘supervision of litigation’ . . . to be given abuse-of-discretion review.""). An exercise of discretion will not be disturbed ""unless
upon a weighing of relevant factors we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error
of judgment."" Adkins v. United States, 816 F.2d 1580 , 1582 (Fed.Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the posture
of this litigation, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to compel mediation.

CONCLUSION

The dismissal of the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) is affirmed, as is the denial of Dr. Pieczenik's motions for recusal of
Judge Pisano, for copyright infringement, and for compulsory mediation.

Appeals from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.

Before JONES, DENNIS and PICKERING, Circuit Judges.

EDITH H. JONES, Circuit Judge:

This case arises from Ergonome's claim that Compaq's Safety and Comfort Guide ("" SCG"") unlawfully infringed on a
copyright held by Ergonome in Preventing Computer Injury: The HAND Book ("" THB""), a teaching text describing
ergonomically correct hand positions for computer users and ways to avoid repetitive stress injuries. On July 11, 2001, after
a seven-day trial, the jury concluded that any copying by Compaq was de minimis and constituted fair use according to 17
U.S.C. § 107. The district court subsequently held that the doctrines of laches and equitable estoppel also barred
Ergonome's claim. Based on these findings, the district court awarded Compag its attorneys’ fees of $2.7 million.
Additionally, the district court deemed defendant Stephanie Brown to be the alter ego of Ergonome as a sanction for
repeated discovery violations throughout the litigation process.

Ergonome, Brown, and her husband Mowrey appeal on multiple grounds and argue, inter alia, that (1) the jury's verdict
should be set aside, (2) the district court erred in finding that laches and equitable estoppel bar their suit, (3) the district
court erred in shifting attorneys’ fees to Ergonome, and (4) Brown and Mowrey are not the alter egos of Ergonome and
should not be held jointly and severally liable for the attorneys' fee award.

To prevail, Ergonome would have to persuade this court that each of the four independent bases for finding in
Compaq's favor ( de minimis, fair use, laches, and equitable estoppel) is legally erroneous. Ergonome has not succeeded in
this formidable task, and, focusing exclusively on the jury's finding of fair use, we affirm the

Page 407

finding of no infringement. We reach no other substantive copyright issues raised by the parties. Additionally, we affirm the
district court's decision to shift attorneys’ fees and its discovery sanction against Brown. However, because no such sanction
was imposed on Mowrey, we reverse this aspect of the judgment.

|. BACKGROUND

In 1992, Stephanie Brown began writing THB and subsequently registered the manuscript with the U.S. Copyright
Office. Brown and Mowrey formed Ergonome in 1993 to publish and market the book. Brown assigned all her rights in THB,
including the copyright, to Ergonome. THB was formally published in 1994.

In 1993, Compaq decided to update a booklet entitled Creating a Comfortable Work Environment that was packaged
with each Compaq computer. During the revision process, Compaq's manager of the Human Factors Group, Cynthia Purvis,
referenced THB. The finished booklet, renamed the Safety and Comfort Guide, contained four illustrations and seven


--- Page 2 ---
phrases that were similar to photographs and phrases in THB. ' Like its predecessor, the SCG was packaged and included
with every Compaq computer.

Meanwhile, Brown and Mowrey had been attempting to market THB to various computer companies, including
Compaq. Mowrey initially spoke to Purvis on the telephone in March 1994 and thereafter sent Purvis a letter detailing
volume discount prices for THB. In November 1994, Brown and Mowrey attended a meeting with Compaq personnel in
Houston to demonstrate Key Moves, a software derivative of THB. During this meeting, Purvis gave Brown a pre-publication
copy of the 1994 SCG. According to Brown, while leafing through the SCG, she became aware of the similarities between
the above-referenced four illustrations and seven phrases and THB. She said nothing of the alleged infringement, however,
choosing instead to pursue the possibility of a software license with Compaq. Brown and Mowrey returned to Compaq again
in January 1995 for another Key Moves demonstration.

In December 1996, Mowrey notified Purvis of Ergonome's infringement claims. In 1997, Compaq filed suit in federal
district court in Houston seeking a declaration that the SCG did not infringe on THB. Ergonome subsequently filed an
infringement action in federal district court in New York, which was transferred and consolidated with Compaq's declaratory
judgment action in Houston. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the district court concluded as a matter of
law that the portions of THB at issue were copyrightable. However, the district court ultimately denied the motions because
genuine issues of material fact remained as to Compaq's affirmative defenses of de minimis and fair use._See Compaq
Computer Corp. v. Ergonome, Inc., 137 F.Supp.2d 768 (S.D.Tex.2001) . The jury trial and resulting appeal followed.

Il. DISCUSSION
A. Liability

""To establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must prove ownership of a valid copyright and copying of constituent
elements of the work that are copyrightable."" Eng'g Dynamics, Inc. v. Structural

Page 408

Software, Inc.,_26 F.3d 1335 , 1340 (5th Cir.1994) (citing Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340 , 361,
111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1999) ). Copyright ownership is shown by (1) proof of originality and copyrightability and
(2) compliance with the applicable statutory requirements. /d. Compaq does not dispute that Ergonome possessed a
statutorily compliant copyright. In addition, the district court held as a matter of law that the portions of THB allegedly copied
by Compag reflected the necessary originality to qualify as copyrightable. ? Compaq Computer Corp. v. Ergonome Inc.. 137
F.Supp.2d 768 , 777 (S.D.Tex.2001). The jury found that Compaq actually copied portions of THB.

Not all copying amounts to copyright infringement, however. Eng'g Dynamics,_26 F.3d at 1340-41 . Specifically,
Congress has excepted from infringement of copyrighted materials copying that amounts to ""fair use"" under 17 U.S.C. § 107.
When determining fair use, Congress has provided a non-exclusive list of factors that must be considered:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. § 107 (2000). In the instant case, Compaq pleaded fair use as an affirmative defense, the jury was instructed
on the four factors enumerated above, and they ultimately concluded that Compaq's copying of the four illustrations and
seven phrases from THB amounted to fair use. On appeal, Ergonome does not challenge the fair use jury instruction.
Instead, the company argues that the district court erroneously excluded evidence relevant to the fair use defense and erred
in refusing to grant Ergonome's motion for judgment as a matter of law as to fair use.

1. Exclusion of Evidence

This court reviews a district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion. Green v.
Administrators of Tulane Educ. Fund, 284 F.3d 642 , 660 (5th Cir.2002). Even if an abuse of discretion is found, the
harmless error doctrine applies unless a substantial right of the complaining party was affected. /d.

Ergonome contends that the district court excluded evidence relevant to the first statutory fair use factor. Specifically,
Ergonome complains about the exclusion of evidence relating to (1) past lawsuits against Compaq for repetitive stress
injuries (""RSI""), (2) the exact number of the offending copies of the SCG distributed with Compaq computers, and (3) the
proposed volume discount quoted to Compaq by Mowrey. The district court apparently premised exclusion on Federal Rule
of Evidence 403, finding that ""its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice."" Fed. R. Evid.
403.


--- Page 3 ---
Ergonome asserts that the evidence concerning past RSI lawsuits is necessary to prove Compaq's ""commercial
motive"" for copying from THB, that is, Compaq's desire to defray potential RSI liability.

Page 409

The first statutory fair use factor asks the court or jury to consider ""the purpose or character of the use."" While Compaq did
not produce the SCG for individual sale or profit, the Supreme Court has noted that ""[t]he crux of the profit/nonprofit
distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation

of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price."" Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S.
539 , 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . Thus, the inclusion of the SCG with each Compaq computer constitutes
a commercial use of the copied material.

The RSI evidence would be relevant to Ergonome's ""motive"" theory. However, the district court concluded that
Ergonome's true reason for seeking to introduce the evidence was to paint Compaq as a ""bad"" company. The court did not
abuse its discretion by concluding that any probative value the RSI evidence might hold was outweighed by its prejudicial
and inflammatory nature and by its tendency to confuse the jury with tangential litigation. In any event, the exclusion was
harmless, because even without the RSI lawsuit evidence, the jury was presented with ample evidence of Compaq's
commercial use, or ""motive,"" relevant to the first statutory fair use factor.

Ergonome also contests the exclusion of the number of 1994 Compaq guides distributed to customers and evidence
concerning the details of a proposed volume discount price submitted by Mowrey. ° Such evidence is claimed to be relevant
to Compaq's commercial use of THB under the first statutory fair use factor. The district court did not abuse its discretion by
excluding this evidence as cumulative or prejudicial. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. Again, any error that may have occurred was
harmless, as Compaq's commercial use of THB was evident from the fact that a copy of Compaq's SCG was bundled with
every Compaq desktop computer sold, and the jury was aware that Compaq sold millions of computers. The jury was also
apprised of Ergonome's desire to sell THB to Compaq and of the sales calls and meetings to that end. Ergonome's
substantial rights were not affected by the exclusion of this evidence.

2. Judgment as a Matter of Law

We review a district court's ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo._/Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Aberdeen
Ins. Servs., Inc., 253 F.3d 878 , 884 (5th Cir.2001). This court views the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in the

light most favorable to the nonmoving party. /d. Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only when the ""facts and
inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the [clourt believes that reasonable men could not

arrive at a contrary verdict.""""Rubinstein v. Administrators of the Tulane Educ. Fund, 218 F.3d 392 , 401 (5th Cir.2000); see
also Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).

Ergonome argues sketchily that the evidence as to each of the four non-exclusive statutory fair use factors points so
overwhelmingly in Ergonome's favor that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law. As
discussed supra, Compaq's use of THB was commercial in the sense that Compaq's SCG was packaged with every desktop
computer. While commerciality generally

Page 410

weighs against finding fair use, it does not end the inquiry; rather, the fair use determination depends on the totality of the
factors considered. See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 584, 114 S.Ct. 1164 1174, 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994) ; Sundeman v. Seajay Soc'y. Inc., 142 F.3d 194 , 203 (4th Cir.1998).

The second statutory factor asks the factfinder to determine ""the nature of the copyrighted work."" The Supreme Court
has noted that ""fair use is more likely to be found in factual works than in fictional works."" Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207 ,
237, 110 S.Ct. 1750 1769. 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) . Ergonome argues that because the district judge found at summary
judgment that portions of THB were sufficiently original to warrant a copyrightability finding, the second factor must favor
Ergonome. In order to be copyrightable, a work must contain a certain modicum of originality. Originality's relatively low
hurdle may be cleared when the ""selection and arrangement"" of sometimes uncopyrightable facts evinces a ""minimal degree
of creativity."" Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340 , 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282 1287, 113 L.Ed.2d 358
(1991) . At summary judgment, the district court concluded that THB possessed the requisite amount of originality.

Ergonome's argument proves too little, however, because fair use excuses otherwise actionable infringement. Thus, a
work will always be found ""original"" for copyrightability purposes before the fair use analysis is applied. The second statutory

fair use factor, then, refers to the ""nature"" of the work beyond this initial inquiry. At trial, Brown herself stated that THB was a

factual teaching text. Based on the evidence submitted at trial, the jury could have easily concluded that THB was a factual
work, as opposed to a highly creative fictional work, and that the second fair use factor favored Compaq.

The third statutory factor considers ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole."" The copied portions of THB at issue in this case amount to four illustrations and seven phrases. The
evidence at trial revealed that THBis approximately 100 pages long and contains over 88 photographs. Based on the


--- Page 4 ---
evidence adduced at trial, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the minimal portions of THB used in Compaq's
SCG were insubstantial in relation to THB as a whole.

Finally, the Copyright Act focuses on ""the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.""
The Supreme Court states that this factor represents the most important aspect of fair use. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566 ,
105 S.Ct. at 2233 . This factor requires courts to consider not only actual harm to the market for the original, but also
whether widespread use of the work, like the sort complained of by the copyright-holder, would impair the potential market
for the original work and any derivative works. Campbell,510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. at 1177.

In this case, Ergonome could not show that the distribution of Compaq's SCG deprived Ergonome of any sales. In fact,
Brown and Mowrey conceded that in June 1994, six months before Compaq began distributing its SCG, they decided to
cease actively marketing THB. Mowrey testified that because of the increased demand for computer software, he and Brown
decided to focus on marketing Key Moves as opposed to THB. In addition, he stated that it was simply too easy for company
managers to read THB and instruct employees on its techniques rather than buy numerous copies of the book. Based on

Page 411

this evidence, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the distribution of Compaq's SCG had little or no impact on the
market for THB. Moreover, Mowrey stated that the potential market for THB was essentially thwarted by an uncontrollable
market phenomenon, namely, managerial consumption and dissemination of THB techniques. The jury could also have
reasonably concluded that Compaq's use of portions of THB had little or no impact on the potential market. The evidence
presented at trial and the reasonable inferences therefrom, when viewed through the lens of the statutory fair use factors,
support the jury's fair use finding. +

B. Attorneys' Fees
The Copyright Act provides that

[i]n any civil action under this title, the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party
other than the United States or an officer thereof. Except as otherwise provided by this title, the court may also award a
reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.

17 U.S.C. § 505 (2000). As the prevailing party, Compaq requested an award of attorneys' fees. In granting Compaq's
request for attorneys’ fees of $2,765,026.90, the district court relied upon several factors, inter alia: (1) Ergonome
continuously failed to comply with discovery orders, which resulted in monetary sanctions and holdings of contempt; (2)
Ergonome filed a multitude of ""non-meritorious motions;"" and (3) had Ergonome prevailed on its $800 million claim for
damages, its attorneys would have received a forty percent contingent fee, which represents an award 120 times greater
than the amount requested by Compaq. Appellants argue that the district court's decision to award attorneys’ fees to
Compaq violates Supreme Court precedent and also represents an abuse of discretion. They do not, however, contest the
quantum of the fee award.

Whether the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in awarding attorneys’ fees is a question of law reviewed
de novo. Hogan Sys., Inc. v. Cybresource Int'l, Inc., 158 F.3d 319 , 325 (5th Cir.1998). We review a district court's decision
to award attorneys’ fees, however, for abuse of discretion. /d.

In deciding to award attorneys' fees, the district court noted that ""[t]he Fifth Circuit has acknowledged that an award of
attorneys’ fees in copyright cases is within the discretion of the trial court, but has held that the award of attorneys’ fees in

copyright cases is the rule rather than the exception, and should be awarded routinely."" See Hogan,158 F.3d at 325 ;
McGaughey v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 12 F.3d 62 , 65 (5th Cir.1994). Appellants argue that the Supreme Court's
decision in Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc.,510 U.S. 517 , 114 S.Ct. 1023 , 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994) , displaced this court's
""discretionary but routinely awarded"" standard. 5 This argument is without merit. In Hogan, this court considered and rejected
the identical argument advanced by Appellants here. 158 F.3d at 325 . Specifically, this court held that both this circuit's rule
and the Fogerty rule allow for district court

Page 412
discretion in the decision to award attorneys' fees. /d. The district court did not apply the incorrect legal standard.

Appellants also argue that the district court failed to apply the correct factors, as announced in Fogerty, when making
its decision. However, the Supreme Court in Fogerty stated that ""[t]here is no precise rule or formula for making [a fee award
determination]...."" 510 U.S. at 534 , 114 S.Ct. at 1033 . The factors that Appellants point to as being determinative
(frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness, and the need to advance considerations of compensation and
deterrence) were indeed referenced by the Court, but only as factors that ""may be used to guide courts’ discretion."" /d. at
535 n. 19, 114 S.Ct. at 1033 n. 19. This court has already considered and rejected the idea that district courts are bound to
apply verbatim the factors listed above. Hogan, 158 F.3d at 325-26 . Additionally, the factors relied upon by the district court
overlap with several of the factors advanced by Appellants, namely, motivation, objective unreasonableness, and



--- Page 5 ---
compensation. The district court did not apply the incorrect legal standard.

Finally, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in awarding Compag its attorneys’ fees. The court
examined both procedural and substantive aspects of the litigation in making its decision. The attorneys' fee award is
affirmed.

C. Discovery Sanction

In its order amending the final judgment, the district court, as discussed supra, ordered ""Ergonome"" to pay Compaq's
attorneys’ fees. The court further defined ""Ergonome"" as ""Ergonome, Inc., Stephanie L. Brown and Thomas Mowrey,"" thus
holding Brown and Mowrey liable for the fee award. Brown and Mowrey were included in the collective definition of
""Ergonome"" following the district court's finding of alter ego as a discovery sanction. ® The sanction was made pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b), which provides that when a party fails to comply with a discovery order, the court may
""order that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established
for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A).
Brown and Mowrey challenge the court's alter ego discovery sanction, which we review for abuse of discretion. Tollett v. City
of Kemah, 285 F.3d 357 , 363 (5th Cir.2002).

The district court's discovery sanction finds its roots in Brown's repeated refusal to respond adequately to
interrogatories aimed at proving alter ego. The dispute began in 1998, when the district court ruled that Compaq would be
given an opportunity to pierce the corporate veil to provide a jurisdictional basis for joining Brown as a party to Compaq's
declaratory judgment action. ’ For over

Page 413

two years, Brown creatively refused to provide the discovery sought by Compaq. ® Brown filed three unsuccessful petitions
for writ of mandamus to this court, one motion requesting that the district judge recuse herself, one motion requesting that
the district court refer the case to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution under the Hobbs Act, and finally, a bankruptcy case in
New York, which the bankruptcy judge ultimately found was filed ""to prevent potential liability of Ms. Brown in the event
Compaq prevailed in the Houston litigation.""

On March 26, 2001, the district court held Ergonome, Inc., Brown, and Mowrey in contempt of court for failing to
respond adequately to Compaq's discovery requests. While the court declined at that time to find that Brown was the alter
ego of Ergonome as a matter of law, the court cautioned that if the discovery was not provided within thirty days, it would be
""prepared to do so in light of Defendants' long history of filibuster and delay on the matter."" In that same order, the court
denied Brown's and Mowrey's motion for judgment on the pleadings, in which they argued the merits of the alter ego issue.
The court noted that Brown and Mowrey were ""ironically invoking the very doctrine on which they have been recalcitrant with
regard to Compaq's discovery requests.""

On July 16, 2001, five days after the trial, the district court entered a final judgment, declaring that Compaq's Safety
and Comfort Guide did not infringe Ergonome's The HAND Book and ordering that Compaq recover its costs from
Ergonome. In that order, the district court referred to Ergonome, Inc., Stephanie L. Brown, and Thomas Mowrey collectively
as ""Ergonome."" Brown and Mowrey moved to alter or amend the final judgment, asserting that they should be removed from
the judgment because Ergonome's corporate veil was never pierced. The district court noted that the argument was simply a
""re-urging of the same points in their Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, which was denied March 26, 2001."" The court
further stated that, after the March 2001 order, Brown and Mowrey were given an opportunity to respond fully to the
discovery requests. Additionally, the court reminded Brown of the March 2001 order warning her that any future failure to
provide the requested discovery would result in a finding that she was the alter ego of Ergonome. Ultimately, the court
granted Compaq's request and, as a sanction, held Brown to be the alter ego of Ergonome, Inc.

The Supreme Court has noted that rule 37(b)(2) ""contains two standards — one general and one specific — that limit a
district court's discretion."" /ns. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694 , 707, 102 S.Ct.
2099 2107, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982) . ""First, any sanction must be ‘just'; second, the sanction must be specifically related to
the particular ‘claim' which was at issue in the order to provide discovery."" /d. Based on the facts and circumstances
surrounding the district court's decision, we conclude that the sanction was ""just."" Compaq struggled for well over two years
to obtain sufficient alter ego discovery from Brown and Ergonome. 9 Brown and Ergonome

Page 414

engaged in abusive practices for the sole purpose of frustrating Compaq's ability to extract the discovery. The district court
was not alone in its assessment of the delaying tactics. In denying Ergonome's third petition for writ of mandamus, this court
warned that ""[t]he mandamus petition is arguably frivolous and would entitle the opposing party to attorneys' fees.""
Additionally, the bankruptcy court found that Ergonome's suggestion of bankruptcy was filed solely to avoid potential liability
in the Compag litigation. The entire egregious course of overlitigation and discovery abuse is among the worst we have
seen. 1°

Second, the court's decision to deem Brown the alter ego of Ergonome was ""specifically related to the particular ‘claim’
which was at issue in the order to provide discovery."" /d. at 707, 102 S.Ct. at 2107 . The purpose of the discovery, from its
very inception, was to discover facts that would support a finding of alter ego. This finding, in turn, would result in piercing


--- Page 6 ---
Ergonome's corporate veil. The district court's sanction of deeming Brown to be the alter ego of Ergonome corresponded to
the ""claim"" at issue in Compaq's repeated discovery requests. '' The result of this sanction — personal liability for attorneys'
fees — flows directly from the finding of alter ego. See id. at 709, 102 S.Ct. at 2108 (""That a particular legal consequence ...
follows from [the discovery sanction], does not in any way affect the appropriateness of the sanction.""). As a result, we
cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in deeming Brown to be the alter ego of Ergonome and that portion of
the order is affirmed.

The district court's order, however, plainly fails to levy the same sanction against Mowrey. The order states: ""As a
sanction the Court will declare Brown to be the alter ego of Ergonome, Inc., and will deny the motion to alter or amend the
final judgment."" Thus, there is no legal basis for holding Mowrey to be the alter ego of Ergonome, Inc., and no corresponding
basis for holding him personally liable for the attorneys' fees in question. Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the district
court's order holding Mowrey personally liable for the attorneys’ fee award.

Page 415
Ill. CONCLUSION

For the reasons discussed above, the judgment in favor of Compaq is AFFIRMED, except insofar as the judgment
holds Thomas Mowrey personally liable for the attorneys’ fee award. The judgment against Mowrey is REVERSED.

AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.

Notes:

1. For example, the SCG contained a hand-drawn illustration of a computer-user's hands, angled wrists, and lower arms positioned over a keyboard, with
a caption below reading ""Angled-Wrist Position — Incorrect."" THB contained a similar photograph with a caption reading ""Angled-wrist position — No.""

2. Ergonome argues that the district court allowed Compaq to relitigate the question of originality and copyrightability. However, the jury was instructed
that THB was “a copyrighted work subject to the protection of the Copyright Act."" Ergonome's argument is wrong.

3. Ergonome asserts that 32,236,510 copies of the SCG were produced. Additionally, Mowrey suggested a volume discount price of $7.95 per copy for
orders of THB over 100,000.

4. Because we uphold the jury's fair use finding, which in turn results in a finding of no infringement, we have no occasion to address Ergonome's other
claims on appeal relating to liability and damages.

5. In Fogerty, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that Section 505 adopted the British Rule of awarding costs to the prevailing party as a matter of
course and instead adopted an ""evenhanded"" approach that relied on the district court's discretion. 510 U.S. at 533-34 , 114 S.Ct. at 1033.

6. A finding that Brown and Mowrey are the alter egos of Ergonome results in their personal liability for the award of attorneys’ fees.

7. Personal jurisdiction may be established over a corporate officer by establishing that the individual is an alter ego of a corporation over which the
district court has established personal jurisdiction. See, e.g., Patin v. Thoroughbred Power Boats Inc., 294 F.3d 640 , 653 (5th Cir.2002). Because the
corporation and its individual alter ego “are the same entity, the jurisdictional contacts of one are the jurisdictional contacts of the other for the purposes
of the International Shoe [ v. Washington,_326 U.S. 310 , 66 S.Ct. 154 , 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945) ], due process analysis."" /d. (emphasis in original). In this
case, the district court found that it had personal jurisdiction over Ergonome, Inc., and no party disputes that finding on appeal.

8. Compaq admits that a portion of the requested discovery was received in 1999, however, the remainder of the discovery requests went unanswered
and was the subject of additional discovery orders by the district court.

9. Brown argues that her responses to Compaq's interrogatories were sufficient. However, although the supplemental answers filed on April 30, 2001,
contain certain additional information not present in the earlier versions, those portions dealing with the relationship among Brown, Mowrey and
Ergonome consist largely of rhetoric aimed at inflaming the opposing party. The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the responses
did not satisfy the March 2001 order.

10. It need hardly be added that the court warned Brown that failure to comply with the discovery order would result in a sanction of the type ultimately
imposed. See id. at 707-08, 102 S.Ct. at 2106-07 (relying on similar factors to conclude that the sanction was ""just"").

11. Brown argues that the district court failed to recognize the difference between alter ego for jurisdictional purposes and alter ego for liability purposes;
she argues that because the discovery sought related only to personal jurisdiction, the district court's sanction affecting her personal liability amounted to
an abuse of discretion.

Although it is true that Compaq originally sought the alter ego discovery to establish personal jurisdiction over Brown, the record supports the
conclusion that by January of 2000, at the very latest, Ergonome was aware of Compaq's desire to prove alter ego for the purpose of collecting attorneys’
fees from Brown and Mowrey individually. Additionally, Compaq moved to amend its complaint on June 1, 2000, and specifically added an alter ego
liability claim. This motion was unopposed. Finally, the district court warned Brown in March of 2001 that failing to comply with the discovery order would
result in a finding of alter ego. Brown's protestations are unconvincing.

PICKERING, Circuit Judge, specially concurring:

| concur in the result but write separately because the attorney's fee sanction against defendant Brown has given me
considerable pause and concern. The district court's finding alter ego as a sanction had the effect of imposing a $2.8 million
attorney's fee on the individual defendant Brown. Our case law is very clear that we should not dismiss a cause of action as


--- Page 7 ---
a sanction unless all other lesser sanctions have been considered and found ineffective. Long v. Simmons. 77 F.3d 878 ,
880 (5th Cir.1996) (""A dismissal without prejudice is appropriate only if the failure to comply with the court order was the
result of purposeful delay or contumaciousness and the record reflects that the district court employed lesser sanctions
before dismissing the action.""). That same rationale should be applicable in this case. Dismissing a complaint puts a plaintiff
out of court without trial, and finding alter ego as a sanction, in this case imposed liability on a defendant without trial. One is
the death sentence to a plaintiff. The other is the death sentence to a defendant.

The Ergonome defendants strenuously argue that plaintiffs were seeking alter ego discovery only for the purpose of
jurisdiction and not for the purpose of liability. However, the record clearly reflects that at least eighteen months before the
sanction was imposed, Compaq made it clear to the Ergonome defendants that it was seeking alter ego liability as to Brown
for attorney's fees. Despite their argument to the contrary, the Ergonome defendants were on notice well before the sanction
was imposed that Compaq was trying to obtain an award of attorney's fees against the individual defendant Brown on the
basis of alter ego.

A sanction of this magnitude is a serious consequence and should not be imposed lightly. See Roadway Express, Inc.
v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752 , 767,100 S.Ct. 2455 , 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980) (""sanctions ... should not be assessed lightly or without
a fair notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record.""). | write separately to emphasize the egregiousness of the
litigation strategy of the Ergonome defendants, absent which | would not concur in this sanction.

The Ergonome defendants' litigation strategy can only be described as fitting the prototype of a trial strategy of extortion
by unreasonably aggressive and obstructive litigation practices. In other words, they attempted to make the litigation so
unpleasant and so costly that the defendants would be forced to settle.

On at least seven different occasions the trial court ordered Ergonome and Brown to comply with alter ego discovery.
Additionally, the court ordered the Ergonome defendants to comply with these discovery requests within thirty days or face a
$1,000 per day fine. Ergonome responded by filing a frivolous bankruptcy petition which was dismissed by the bankruptcy
court on the ground that Brown was seeking to avoid the consequences of having attorney's fees assessed against her in
this action. The trial court then levied a $34,000 sanction against Brown and her attorneys for failing to comply with
discovery orders. Eventually the court advised Ergonome and Brown that if they did not

Page 416

comply with the alter ego discovery requests within thirty days, alter ego would be admitted as a discovery sanction. Yet in
face of all of this, Ergonome and Brown only provided cursory answers. As a last resort, the trial court imposed the sanction
of taking alter ego as having been established, the issue as to which Ergonome had stonewalled Compaq by failing to
provide adequate discovery.

Additionally, Ergonome and Brown filed three meritless petitions for writs of mandamus to the Fifth Circuit in this
litigation. A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is rarely granted. See In re Avantel, S.A., 343 F.3d 311 , 317
(6th Cir.2003). After the third writ of mandamus, the Fifth Circuit warned Ergonome and Brown that the petition was
arguably frivolous and could entitle Compaq to attorney's fees. Besides filing for three writs of mandamus, Ergonome
employed another unusual tactic by filing a motion for interlocutory appeal to the Fifth Circuit which was denied.

But that is not all. Ergonome filed a 60-page memorandum asking the trial judge to recuse herself on a relatively
straightforward and tenuous basis. When the trial court refused to recuse herself, Ergonome followed up with a frivolous 39-
page motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to recuse. Ergonome also filed a 63-page request, based on a farfetched
theory, that plaintiffs be referred for prosecution. The trial court refused to do so. Ergonome made a demand for $800 million
in their complaint. Based on the record in this case, such a demand was preposterous. The trial strategy of the Ergonome
defendants was clearly vexatious and oppressive.

The trial court found that there was ""an incredible amount of gamesmanship"" by Ergonome and Brown and that they
had ""not acted in good faith."" Since lesser sanctions did not get the defendants’ attention and did not result in an appropriate
response to discovery, and in view of the oppressive and obstructive litigation strategy of the defendants, the sanction
imposed by the trial court was appropriate.

Appeal from the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
Before WALLACE, SNEED, and KOZINSKI, Circuit Judges
SNEED, Circuit Judge:

The plaintiffs-appellants, Marvin Fisher and Jack Segal, appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment disposing
of their federal claim for copyright infringement and their state-law claims for unfair competition, defamation, and product
disparagement. We affirm.

I.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The plaintiffs-appellants, Marvin Fisher and Jack Segal (the composers), composed and own the copyright to the '50s
standard ""When Sunny Gets Blue"" (the song). In late 1984, a law firm representing the defendants-appellees--disc jockey
Rick Dees, Atlantic Recording Corp., and Warner Communications, Inc. ' --contacted Fisher and requested permission to
use part or all of the music to ""When Sunny Gets Blue"" in order to create a comedic and inoffensive version of the song.
Fisher refused the request.

A few months later, Dees released a comedy record album (also issued in cassette form) called Put It Where the Moon
Don't Shine. One cut on the album, entitled ""When Sonny Sniffs Glue"" (the parody), is an obvious take-off on the composers'
song. The parody copies the first six of the song's thirty-eight bars of music--its recognizable main theme. In addition, it
changes the original's opening lyrics--""When Sunny gets blue, her eyes get gray and cloudy, then the rain begins to fall"" to
""When Sonny sniffs glue, her eyes get red and bulgy, then her hair begins to fall."" The parody runs for 29 seconds of the
approximately forty minutes of material on Dees's album.

The composers brought an action in federal district court for copyright infringement, unfair competition, product
disparagement, and defamation. The complaint included a proper demand for a jury trial. Before the commencement of
discovery, both sides filed motions for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Dees on
all the composers' claims and the composers timely filed this appeal.

I.
DISCUSSION
The district court did not reveal the bases for its decision. Nonetheless, we may affirm if the record, viewed in the light

most favorable to the composers, discloses no genuine issues of material fact and if Dees was entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. See Frederick S. Wyle Professional Corp. v. Texaco, Inc., 764 F.2d 604 , 609 (9th Cir.1985).

A. Copyright Infringement

Dees urges affirmance of summary judgment on the claim for copyright infringement on the ground that the copying of
the song for purposes of parody constituted a fair use. ? We agree for the reasons discussed below.


--- Page 2 ---
Page 435
1. Overview of the fair-use doctrine

The fair-use doctrine was initially developed by courts as an equitable defense to copyright infringement. In effect, the
doctrine creates a limited privilege in those other than the owner of a copyright to use the copyrighted material in a
reasonable manner without the owner's consent. See Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, --- U.S. ----, 105
S.Ct. 2218 2225, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (citing H. Ball, Law of Copyright and Literary Property 260 (1944)). Congress
codified this judge-made doctrine in section 107 of the Copyrights Act of 1976, Pub.L.No. 94-553, Sec. 107, 90 Stat. 2541,
2546 (codified at 17 U.S.C. Sec. 107 (1982)); but that enactment did not freeze the fair-use doctrine in stone. Rather,
Congress expressly sought to preserve the doctrine's common law character, leaving courts ""free to adapt the doctrine to
particular situations on a case-by-case basis."" 17 U.S.C. Sec. 107 historical and revision notes (1982).

In restating the fair-use doctrine in section 107, Congress enumerated four nonexclusive factors for courts to consider:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. Sec. 107 (1982). In addition, in the legislative notes accompanying the provision, Congress listed examples
""of the sort of activities the courts might regard as fair use under the circumstances."" Id. Sec. 107 historical and revision
notes (1982).

Congress named parody as one of these activities. Nonetheless, parody was not classified as a presumptively fair use.
See Harper & Row, 105 S.Ct. at 2231 . Each assertion of the ""parody defense"" must be considered individually, in light of
the statutory factors, reason, experience, and, of course, the general principles developed in past cases.

There have been few cases in this circuit involving the parody branch of the fair-use doctrine. An early case, Benny v.
Loew's Inc., 239 F.2d 532 (9th Cir.1956) , aff'd by an equally divided Court, 356 U.S. 43 , 78 S.Ct. 667 , 2 L.Ed.2d 583
(1958) , 3 held that "" 'a parodized or burlesqued taking [was] to be treated no differently from any other [copyright]
appropriation,' ""id. at 537 (quoting lower court opinion, 131 F.Supp. 165 , 183 (S.D.Cal.1955)). This decision was criticized
by contemporary commentators, see Berlin v. E.C. Publications, Inc., 329 F.2d 541 , 544-45 (2d Cir.) (listing critiques), cert.
denied, 379 U.S. 822 , 85 S.Ct. 46 , 13 L.Ed.2d 33 (1964) , and was essentially repudiated by Congress's recognition of
parody in the notes to the Copyrights Act of 1976. See discussion, supra. Accordingly. in Walt Disney Productions v. Air
Pirates, 581 F.2d 751 (9th Cir.1978) , cert denied, 439 U.S. 1132 , 99 S.Ct. 1054 , 59 L.Ed.2d 94 (1979) , we gave the
Benny opinion a narrow

Page 436

interpretation and acknowledged that parody is a potential fair use subject to the multi-factor analysis codified in section 107.
See id. at 756-58.

2. Applying the fair-use test

The composers advance five principal reasons why the parody before us is not a fair use: (1) the so-called parody is
not actually a parody, or at least is not a parody of the composers’ song; (2) Dees acted in bad faith; (3) Dees's use is
commercial in nature; (4) the parody competes in the same market--record albums and tapes--as the song; and (5) the
aking is more substantial than was reasonably necessary to ""conjure up"" the original in the mind of the audience.

In addition, the composers assert that the question of fair use is an issue for the jury. Even if the material facts
pertaining to each factor in the fair-use test are undisputed, they maintain, the ultimate issue, fair use or no, is appropriate
or determination on summary judgment only when no reasonable jury could have decided the question differently.

(a) Judge or jury?

We dispose of this last argument first, because it is completely undercut by the Supreme Court's recent decision in
Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, --- U.S. ----, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . The Court held
in that case that ""[flair use is a mixed question of law and fact"", id. at 2231, and that ""[w]here the District Court has found
acts sufficient to evaluate each of the statutory factors,"" an appellate court may conclude as a matter of law--without
remanding for further factfinding--"" ‘that [the challenged use] do[es] not qualify as a fair use of the copyrighted work,' "" id.
(quoting Pacific & Southern Co. v. Duncan, 744 F.2d 1490 , 1495 n. 8 (11th Cir.1984), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----105 S.Ct.
1867 , 85 L.Ed.2d 161 (1985) ).

No material historical facts are at issue in this case. The parties dispute only the ultimate conclusions to be drawn from
the admitted facts. Because, under Harper & Row, these judgments are legal in nature, we can make them without usurping
the function of the jury.


--- Page 3 ---
(b) Substantive fair-use issues
We now turn to the composers' numerous substantive arguments as to why the fair-use defense is not available.
(1) The subject of the parody

The composers assert that the parody, although it borrows from the original work, was not ""directed"" at the original.
That is, a humorous or satiric work deserves protection under the fair-use doctrine only if the copied work is at least partly
the target of the work in question. See Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, 581 F.2d 751 , 758 n. 15 (9th Cir.1978), cert.
denied, 439 U.S. 1132 , 99 S.Ct. 1054 , 59 L.Ed.2d 94 (1979) . Otherwise, there is no need to ""conjure up"" the original in the
audience's mind and no justification for borrowing from it. Id; accord MCA. Inc. v. Wilson. 677 F.2d 180 , 185 (2d Cir.1981).

We requested counsel to provide us with tapes of both Dees's parody and the original (as sung by Johnny Mathis).
Although we have no illusions of musical expertise, it was clear to us that Dees's version was intended to poke fun at the
composers' song, and at Mr. Mathis's rather singular vocal range. We reject the notion that the song was used merely as a
vehicle to achieve a comedic objective unrelated to the song, its place and time. Cf. id. at 183-85 (purpose of saving the
effort of composing original music); infra note 5.

(2) The propriety of Dees's conduct

One theme running through the composers' briefs is that Dees's alleged bad conduct should bar his use of the
equitable defense of fair use. The principle invoked is sound. Because "" '[f]air use presupposes ""good faith"" and ""fair
dealing,"" '"" Harper & Row, 105 S.Ct. at 2232 (quoting Time Inc. v. Bernard Geis Associates, 293 F.Supp. 130 , 146
(S.D.N.Y.1968)), courts

may weigh ""the propriety of the defendant's conduct"" in the equitable balance of a fair use determination, 3 M. Nimmer,
Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 13.05[A], at 13-72 to -73 (rev.ed. 1985).

Nonetheless, we conclude that the composers have failed to identify any conduct of Dees that is sufficiently
blameworthy. For example, Fisher and Segal fault Dees for using the song after Fisher expressly refused him permission to
do so. In their view, this shows bad faith on Dees's part. We cannot agree. Parodists will seldom get permission from those
whose works are parodied. Self-esteem is seldom strong enough to permit the granting of permission even in exchange for
a reasonable fee. See Note, The Parody Defense to Copyright Infringement: Productive Fair Use After Betamax, 97
Harv.L.Rev. 1395, 1397 n. 12 (1984) [hereinafter cited as Parody Defense ]. The parody defense to copyright infringement
exists precisely to make possible a use that generally cannot be bought. See 3 M. Nimmer, supra, Sec. 13.05[C], at 13-89;
Gordon, Fair Use as Market Failure: A Structural and Economic Analysis of the Betamax Case and its Predecessors, 82
Colum.L.Rev. 1600, 1633 & n. 177. Moreover, to consider Dees blameworthy because he asked permission would penalize
him for this modest show of consideration. Even though such gestures are predictably futile, we refuse to discourage them.

The composers also claim that the parody is immoral and thus unprotected by the fair-use doctrine. They cite the
parody's irreverent references to drug addiction and its purported use of obscenities. Assuming without deciding that an
obscene use is not a fair use, but see Pillsbury Co. v. Milky Way Productions, Inc., 215 U.S.P.Q. 124 , 131 &n. 10
(N.D.Ga.1981), we conclude, after listening to it, that the parody is innocuous--silly perhaps, but surely not obscene or
immoral.

(3) The purpose and character of the use

The first fair-use factor section 107 directs courts to consider is ""the purpose and character of the use, including
whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes."" 17 U.S.C. Sec. 107(1) (1982). The
parties agree that the parody is a commercial use of the song. This fact ""tends to weigh against a finding of fair use,"" Harper
& Row, 105 S.Ct. at 2231 , because ""every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation of
the monopoly privilege that belongs to the owner of the copyright."" Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417,
451, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 793, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) .

We recognize, however, that many parodies distributed commercially may be ""more in the nature of an editorial or
social commentary than ... an attempt to capitalize financially on the plaintiff's original work."" Milky Way Productions, 215.
U.S.P.Q. at 131 (footnote omitted). In such cases, of which this is one, the initial presumption need not be fatal to the
defendant's cause. The defendant can rebut the presumption by convincing the court that the parody does not unfairly
diminish the economic value of the original. See id. & n. 9.

(4) The economic effect of the use

Thus, we must turn our attention to the fourth factor in the fair-use analysis--""the effect of the use upon the potential
market for or value of the copyrighted work,"" 17 U.S.C. Sec. 107(4). This factor, not surprisingly, ""is undoubtedly the single
most important element of fair use."" Harper & Row, 105 S.Ct. at 2234 (footnote omitted).

In assessing the economic effect of the parody, the parody's critical impact must be excluded. Through its critical
function, a ""parody may quite legitimately aim at garroting the original, destroying it commercially as well as artistically."" B.
Kaplan, An Unhurried View of Copyright 69 (1967). Copyright law is not designed to stifle critics. "" ‘Destructive’ parodies play


--- Page 4 ---
an important role in social and literary criticism
Page 438

and thus merit protection even though they may discourage or discredit an original author."" Parody Defense, 96 Harv.L.Rev.
at 1411. Accordingly, the economic effect of a parody with which we are concerned is not its potential to destroy or diminish
the market for the original--any bad review can have that effect--but rather whether it fulfills the demand for the original.
Biting criticism suppresses demand; copyright infringement usurps it. Thus, infringement occurs when a parody supplants
the original in markets the original is aimed at, or in which the original is, or has reasonable potential to become,
commercially valuable. See, e.g., Air Pirates, 581 F.2d at 756 ; Berlin v. E.C. Publications, Inc., 329 F.2d 541 , 545 (2d Cir.),
cert. denied, 379 U.S. 822 , 85 S.Ct. 46 , 13 L.Ed.2d 33 (1964) ; Parody Defense, supra, at 1409-11.

This is not a case in which commercial substitution is likely. ""When Sunny Gets Blue"" is ""a lyrical song concerning or
relating to a woman's feelings about lost love and her chance for ... happiness again."" Appellants' Opening Brief at 3. By
contrast, the parody is a 29-second recording concerning a woman who sniffs glue, which ""ends with noise and laughter
mixed into the song."" Id. at 7. We do not believe that consumers desirous of hearing a romantic and nostalgic ballad such as
the composers' song would be satisfied to purchase the parody instead. Nor are those fond of parody likely to consider
""When Sunny Gets Blue"" a source of satisfaction. The two works do not fulfill the same demand. Consequently, the parody
has no cognizable economic effect on the original.

(5) The amount and substantiality of the taking

This court has also consistently focused on the third fair-use factor--the amount and substantiality of the taking, 17
U.S.C. Sec. 107(3). See Air Pirates, 581 F.2d at 756 . Thus far, however, we have provided few concrete guidelines; we
have merely sketched the outer boundaries of the inquiry. On the one hand, ""substantial copying by a defendant, combined
with the fact that the portion copied constituted a substantial part of the defendant's work,"" does not automatically preclude
the fair use defense. Id. On the other hand, ""copying that is virtually complete or almost verbatim"" will not be protected. Id.

In Air Pirates, we ultimately based our analysis on the so-called ""conjure up"" test. See Air Pirates, 581 F.2d at 757
(citing Berlin v. E.C. Publications, Inc., 329 F.2d 541 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 822 , 85 S.Ct. 46 , 13 L.Ed.2d 33
(1964) , and Columbia Pictures Corp. v. National Broadcasting Co., 137 F.Supp. 348 (S.D.Cal.1955) ). As the Air Pirates
opinion articulated it, the test asks ""whether the parodist has appropriated a greater amount of the original work than is
necessary to 'recall or conjure up' the object of his satire."" Id. The composers interpret this test to limit the amount of
permissible copying to that amount necessary to evoke only initial recognition in the listener. 4

We disagree with this rigid view. As the Second Circuit stated in Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 623

F.2d 252 (2d Cir.1980) (per curiam):

[T]he concept of ""conjuring up"" an original came into the copyright law not as a limitation on how much of an original

Page 439

may be used, but as a recognition that a parody frequently needs to be more than a fleeting evocation of an original in order
to make its humorous point. A parody is entitled at least to ""conjure up"" the original.

Id. at 253 n. 1 (citation omitted). Air Pirates does not compel a different view. In that case--which concerned the near-
verbatim copying of Disney characters in the defendants’ underground comic book--we concluded that the defendants ""took
more than was necessary to place firmly in the reader's mind the parodied work and those specific attributes that [were] to
be satirized,"" 581 F.2d at 758 . We did not set a fixed limit on copying, but merely expressed our judgment that that
particular parody could easily have been accomplished through more restricted means.

We singled out three considerations that we thought important in determining whether a taking is excessive under the
circumstances--the degree of public recognition of the original work, the ease of conjuring up the original work in the chosen
medium, and the focus of the parody. See Air Pirates, 581 F.2d at 757-58 . Because the Disney characters were familiar and
graphics was a relatively easy medium for parody, we concluded that close copying was impermissible. See id. But we
expressly noted that media other than the graphic arts might justify greater leeway. We observed: ""[W]hen the medium
involved is a comic book, a recognizable caricature is not difficult to draw, so that an alternative that involves less copying is
more likely to be available than if a speech, for instance, is parodied."" Id. at 758.

The unavailabity of viable alternatives is evident in the present case. Like a speech, a song is difficult to parody
effectively without exact or near-exact copying. If the would-be parodist varies the music or meter of the original
substantially, it simply will not be recognizable to the general audience. This ""special need for accuracy,"" provides some
license for ""closer"" parody. See id. To be sure, that license is not limitless: the parodist's desire to make the best parody
must be ""balanced against the rights of the copyright owner in his original expressions.” 5 Id. We think the balance tips in the
parodists' favor here. In view of the parody's medium, its purposes, and its brevity, it takes no more from the original than is
necessary to accomplish reasonably its parodic purpose.

Page 440

(6) Summation


--- Page 5 ---
We conclude that ""When Sonny Sniffs Glue"" is a parody deserving of fair-use protection as a matter of law. Thus, we
affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on the copyright claim.

B. State Law Claims
1. Unfair competition

Dees's album, Put It Where the Moon Don't Shine, contains six musical numbers including the parody. The album
cover's credits list Dees as the author of five of the songs, but no credits appear in connection with ""When Sonny Sniffs
Glue."" Fisher and Segal assert that, in so designing the cover, Dees implicity represented that the music, words, and title of
he parody were also authored by him. Thus, Fisher and Segal conclude, Dees engaged in unfair competition by deceiving
he public as to the true source of the parody.

Under California law, a plaintiff claiming unfair competition must ""prove a likelihood of confusion by purchasers as to
source."" Air Pirates, 581 F.2d at 760 . Yet this confusion must be of a specific kind: the public must be misled into thinking
hat the defendant's product is actually the plaintiff's. In other words, the defendant must be guilty of ""passing off"" his
product as the plaintiff's. See Sinatra v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 435 F.2d 711 , 714 (9th Cir.1970), cert. denied,402
U.S. 906 (1971) . See generally W.P. Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on Torts Sec. 130, at 1015 (5th ed. lawyer's ed. 1984)
(discussing tort of ""passing off""). Here, there is no ""passing off."" In fact, the composers allege the opposite situation--namely
hat Dees sells their work as if it were his.

Assuming arguendo that the false claiming of authorship constitutes a separate tort under California law, such a cause
of action is nevertheless preempted by federal law. In Compco Corp. v. Day-Bright Lighting, Inc., 376 U.S. 234 , 84 S.Ct.
779 , 11 L.Ed.2d 669 (1964) , and Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.. 376 U.S. 225 , 84 S.Ct. 784 , 11 L.Ed.2d 661 (1964) ,
he Supreme Court determined that the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const., art. VI, precludes
he states from protecting types of intellectual property that are already covered by the federal copyright or patent laws.
Sears and Compco ""majkje it very clear that just as a state could not encroach upon the federal patent laws directly it could
not do so indirectly under the guise of enforcing its laws against unfair competition where those laws would clash with the
ederal objectives."" Sinatra v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 435 F.2d 711 , 717 (9th Cir.1970), cert. denied,402 U.S. 906 ,
91 S.Ct. 1376 , 28 L.Ed.2d 646 (1971) . The same applies to the copyright statute. Accordingly, the kind of misappropriation
alleged by the composers can be redressed, if at all, only under federal law.

2. Defamation/Disparagement

Finally, the composers claim that Dees defamed them and disparaged their song by associating the song ""with
obscene, indecent and offensive words"" and by causing it ""to be reproduced, distributed and performed for and to the public
in an offensive manner."" See Excerpt of the Clerk's Record at 8-9 (reprinting the composers’ third and fourth causes of
action). A recent California case, Polygram Records, Inc. v. Superior Court, 170 Cal.App.3d 543 , 216 Cal.Rptr. 252 (1985) ,
persuades us that the composers cannot prevail. The court in Polygram, relying in part on the guarantees of free speech in
the state constitution, held that defamation and product disparagement claims against comedic works may be dismissed
summarily if the material the plaintiff complains of ""is not fairly susceptible of a defamatory meaning."" 170 Cal.App.3d at 551
, 216 Cal.Rptr. at 256 . Because Dees's parody cannot reasonably be understood in a defamatory sense by those who hear
it, the composers’ claims for defamation and disparagement must fail.

AFFIRMED.

1 All the defendants-appellees occupy the same position in this suit. For purposes of convenience, we shall henceforth refer only to defendant-appellee
Rick Dees. What is said with respect to him applies equally to the others.

2 We reject out of hand the appellees’ other two arguments for affirmance. The first one--that the first amendment gives parodists a blanket protection
from copyright infringement actions--has previously been rejected by this circuit. See Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, 581 F.2d 751 , 758-59 (9th
Cir.1978) (holding that "" ‘the idea-expression line’ "" separating infringement from non-infringement "" ‘represents an acceptable definitional balance as
between copyright and free speech interests’ "" (quoting Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald's Corp., 562 F.2d 1157 , 1170 (9th
Cir.1977))), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1132 , 99 S.Ct. 1054 , 59 L.Ed.2d 94 (1979) . The second one--that the taking from the song was de minimis and thus
not violative of the composers’ copyright--is not supported by the facts. As a rule, a taking is considered de minimis only if it is so meager and
fragmentary that the average audience would not recognize the appropriation. See, e.g., Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 482 F.Supp.
741 , 744 (S.D.N.Y.) (holding that a parodist's copying of four notes in a 100-measure composition was not merely a de minimis taking where that
musical phrase was the heart of the composition), aff'd per curiam, 623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir.1980) . Here, the appropriation would be recognized instantly by
anyone familiar with the original. As an analytical matter, moreover, it would seem contradictory to assert that copying for parodic purposes could be de
minimis. A parody is successful only if the audience makes the connection between the original and its comic version. To ""conjure up"" the original work in
the audience's mind, the parodist must appropriate a substantial enough portion of it to evoke recognition.

3 The case involved Jack Benny's television parody of the theatrical film Gaslight.

4 Relying on this construction of the test, the composers introduced the affidavit of a musicologist, Irwin Coster, who declared that Dees could have
conjured up the song by using only its first five notes and the words ""when Sunny gets blue."" Declaration of Irwin Coster in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion
for Partial Summary Judgment at 4, reprinted in Excerpt of the Clerk's Record, item 16, at 4. In response, Dees submitted an affidavit declaring his
conviction that ""we took the smallest amount possible from 'When Sunny Gets Blue’ in order to parody it."" Declaration of Rick Dees Offered in Opposition
to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction or in the Alternative a Preliminary Injunction at 3, reprinted in Excerpt of the Clerk's
Record, item 9, at 3. We regard both these affidavits as irrelevant. Although the actual amount taken is a factual issue susceptible of proof, it is a question
of law whether the taking is excessive under the circumstances. See Harper & Row, 105 S.Ct. at 2231 .

5 Two music-related parody cases from the Second Circuit, MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 677 F.2d 180 (2d Cir.1981) and Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National



--- Page 6 ---
Broadcasting Co., 482 F.Supp. 741 (S.D.N.Y.), affd per curiam, 623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir.1980) , provide a useful contrast for purposes of assessing the
amount and substantiality of various takings. In MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, the court held the doctrine of fair use inapplicable in the case of a song called
""Cunnilingus Champion of Company C,"" which closely tracked the music and meter of the 40's standard, ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B."" The
composers of ""Champion,"" which was created for performance in the off-Broadway musical Let My People Come, admitted that the song was not
originally conceived as a parody of ""Bugle Boy."" Rather, they had copied the original because it was "" immediately identifiable as something happy and
joyous and it brought back a certain period in our history when we felt that way.'"" 677 F.2d at 184 (quoting uncited trial record). Central to the court's
holding was the determination that ""Champion"" was not a parody of ""Bugle Boy""; in copying ""Bugle Boy"" almost verbatim, the composers’ purpose was
simply to reap the advantages of a well-known tune and short-cut the rigors of composing original music. See id. at 183-85.

Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 482 F.Supp. 741 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd per curiam, 623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir.1980) , concerned a Saturday Night
Live parody of the song ""| Love New York."" The SNL version, entitled ""| Love Sodom,"" was ""sung a cappella by a chorus line of three SNL regulars to the
tune of '| Love New York,’ with the words 'l Love Sodom’ repeated three times."" Id. at 743. Having first determined that the SNL song was indeed a
parody of the original, the court went on to hold that the parodist's copying and repetition of a four-note phrase from the original--which it found to be the
""heart of the composition,"" id. at 744--was not an excessive taking. In support of its decision, the court observed that (1) the repetition of the copied
material served both to ensure viewer recognition and to satirize the frequent broadcasting of the original; and (2) the parodic use of the copied material
lasted only 18 seconds, see id. at 747. The instant case is much closer to the facts of Elsmere than to those of MCA.

JOHN M. WALKER, JR., Chief Judge.

This case presents us with an opportunity to examine the import of the Supreme Court's holding in Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. 471 U.S. 539 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) , that ""the propriety of the
defendant's conduct"" is relevant to the ""character"" of the use under the first factor of the statutory fair use test for copyright
infringement. /d. at 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (quoting 3 M. Nimmer, Copyright § 13.05[A], at 13-72 (1984)); see 17 U.S.C. § 107
(enumerating the fair use factors). Because a full balancing of the statutory fair use factors of § 107, including an evaluation
of the propriety of defendants’ conduct, favors the relevant defendants-appellees in this case, we affirm.

Plaintiffs-appellants NXIVM and First Principles, Inc. (collectively, ""NXIVM""), producers of business training seminars,
appeal from the decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (Thomas J. McAvoy,
District Judge ), denying a preliminary injunction against various defendants-appellees who were alleged to have infringed
NXIVM's copyrighted course materials by posting part of them on the internet. Although we find that the district court erred in
its application of the first statutory fair use factor, we ultimately agree that NXIVM cannot show a likelihood of success on the
merits. Accordingly, we affirm. See Adirondack Transit Lines, Inc. v. United Trans. Union, Local 1582, 305 F.3d 82 , 88 (2d
Cir.2002) (""[W]e are entitled to affirm... on any ground for which there is support in the record, even if not adopted"" by the
district court); see also AmBase Corp. v. City Investing Co. Liquidating Trust, 326 F.3d 63 , 72 (2d Cir.2003)(same); Wright v.
Giuliani, 230 F.3d 543 , 547 (2d Cir.2000).

1. BACKGROUND

NXIVM provides a course manual for the paid subscribers to its exclusive and expensive seminar training program
known as ""Executive Success."" The 265-page manual contains a copyright notice on virtually every page and all seminar
participants sign non-disclosure agreements, purporting to bar them from releasing the manuscript or proprietary techniques
learned in the seminars to others. It is unpublished in the sense that it is not available to the general public. NXIVM claims to
have developed a proprietary ""technology"" called ""Rational Inquiry,"" TM a methodology to improve communication and
decision-making.


--- Page 2 ---
Defendant Rick Ross runs nonprofit websites, www.rickross.com and www.cultnews.com, in connection with his work
as a for-profit ""cult de-programmer."" The websites provide information to the public about controversial groups, about which
complaints of mind control have been lodged. Ross allegedly learned of NXIVM's activities in the course of his de-
programming services, obtaining the manuscript indirectly from defendant Stephanie Franco, a one-time NXIVM participant.

Two reports authored separately by defendants John Hochman and Paul Martin, self-styled experts on groups such as
NXIVM, were commissioned by Ross; they analyze and critique the materials from the manual. The reports quote sections of
the manual in support of their analyses and criticisms and were ultimately made available to the public through Ross's
websites. One of the reports plainly acknowledges that NXIVM has ""intellectual property rights"" in its materials and that
NXIVM makes an effort to keep its manual ""confidential."" This report

Page 476

seems to appreciate that its access to the copyrighted materials was unauthorized, although this is likely a disputed issue of
fact.

NXIVM sued Ross and various co-defendants for copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 & 106A, trademark
disparagement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), and interference with contractual relations under state law
(because the materials were allegedly procured through defendant Franco's purported violation of her non-disclosure
agreement). Principally on the basis of the copyright infringement claim, NXIVM moved for a preliminary injunction to require
that defendants remove the copyrighted information from Ross's websites.

The district court denied the preliminary injunction, finding no likelihood of NXIVM's success on the merits because
defendants’ fair use defense was likely to succeed. See Random House. Inc. v. Rosetta Books LLC, 283 F.3d 490 , 491 (2d
Cir.2002) (per curiam). However, the district court preliminarily enjoined Stephanie Franco from any further release of
NXIVM's materials. NXIVM appealed.

Il. DISCUSSION
A. Legal Standards

We review the denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion. See Zervos v. Verizon New York, Inc., 252
F.3d 163 , 171 (2d Cir.2001). But we may affirm on any ground supported by the recordAmBase Corp.,.326 F.3d at 72.A
party seeking a preliminary injunction in this circuit must show: (1) irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction and (2)
either (a) a likelihood of success on the merits or (b) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair
ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the movant's favor. ABKCO Music, Inc. v. Stellar
Records, Inc., 96 F.3d 60 , 64 (2d Cir.1996). In a copyright case, the irreparable harm requirement can be met by proof of a
likelihood of success on the merits. /d.

To demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of its copyright claim, NXIVM must establish that it owns a valid
copyright and that defendants have engaged in unauthorized copying. See id. Defendants can defeat this prima facie
showing of infringement, however, by demonstrating that their copying is protected by the fair use doctrine. See Tufenkian
Import/ Export Ventures, Inc. v. Einstein Moomiy. Inc., 338 F.3d 127 , 131 (2d Cir.2003); Infinity Broad. Corp. v. Kirkwood,
150 F.3d 104 , 107 (2d Cir.1998). The factors relevant to determining whether fair use applies to a particular case are set
forth in 17 U.S.C. § 107, which provides:

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work ... for purposes such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching ..., scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining
whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include —

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of
all the above factors.

Although defendants bear the burden of proving that their use was fair, see Infinity,
Page 477

150 F.3d at 107 , they need not establish that each of the factors set forth in § 107 weighs in their favorWright v. Warner
Books, Inc., 953 F.2d 731 , 740 (2d Cir.1991). Instead, all factors must be explored and the results weighed together in light
of the purposes of copyright and the fair use defense. See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 578,114



--- Page 3 ---
S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) .

B. Defendants’ Fair Use Defense

At the core of this appeal is the proper weighing, in a copyright infringement suit, of the first of the four statutory fair use
factors after Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 539 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . We must decide whether the district court should have more
fully and explicitly considered, in its analysis of the first factor, that defendants must have known (or at least very likely knew)
that the unpublished manuscript from which quotations were taken and which was disseminated on the internet was
acquired in an unauthorized fashion. We conclude that the district court did not fully analyze the impact of defendants'
alleged misappropriation of the NXIVM manual in assessing fair use. Accordingly, we cannot adopt the district court's fair
use analysis in whole. However, following our own review of the relevant factors, including the subfactor that the district
court failed to address fully and explicitly within the first factor, we conclude that the doctrine of fair use still defeats any
likelihood of plaintiffs’ success on the merits. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of the preliminary injunction.

We turn to the four-factor test for fair use.
1. The ""purpose and character"" inquiry
The court's function, in inquiring into ""the purpose and character of the use,"" 17 U.S.C. § 107(1), is:

to see, in Justice Story's words, whether the new work merely “supersede[s] the objects’ of the original creation, or
instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or
message..., in other words, whether and to what extent the new work is ‘transformative.’ ... [T]he goal of copyright, to
promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works. Such [transformative] works
thus lie at the heart of the fair use doctrine's guarantee of breathing space ...

Campbell,_510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citations omitted) (alterations in original). We agree with the district court
that the websites' use of quotations from the manual to support their critical analyses of the seminars is transformative. As
we held in Wright, ""there is a strong presumption that factor one favors the defendant if the allegedly infringing work fits the
description of uses described in § 107."" Wright_953 F.2d at 736 . Where the defendants’ use is for the purposes of ""criticism,
comment ... scholarship, or research,"" 17 U.S.C. § 107, factor one will normally tilt in the defendants’ favor.

This presumption, moreover, is not necessarily rebutted by a concurrent commercial purpose on a defendant's part,
here the fact that Ross and Martin also run for-profit businesses in connection with their criticisms. The Supreme Court in

Campbell rejected the notion that the commercial nature of the use could by itself be a dispositive consideration. The
Campbell opinion observes that ""nearly all of the illustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of § 107, including news
reporting, comment, criticism, teaching, scholarship, and research ... ‘are generally conducted for profit,"""" Campbell, 510
U.S. at 584 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting Harper

Page 478

& Row, 471 U.S. at 592 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 )(Brennan, J., dissenting), and that Congress ""could not have intended"" a rule that
commercial uses are presumptively unfair. /d. The commercial objective of the secondary work is only a subfactor within the
first factor. ""[T]he more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism,
that may weigh against a finding of fair use."" /d. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Finding the work substantially transformative, the
district court properly discounted the secondary commercial nature of the use.

What the district court did not fully and explicitly consider, and what NXIVM correctly urges that it should have
considered, is ""the propriety of [a] defendant's conduct,"" as directed by Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562-63 , 105 S.Ct. 2218
(citations omitted). Our circuit has recognized that this is an integral part of the analysis under the first factor. Wright_953.
F.2d at 737 ; see also Los Angeles News Serv. v. KCAL-TV Channel 9, 108 F.3d 1119 , 1122 (9th Cir.1997) (finding analysis
of the defendant's conduct to be relevant ""at least to the extent that [the defendant] may knowingly have exploited a
purloined work for free that could have been obtained for a fee""). While some have commented that this inquiry is counter-
indicated by the policy interests supporting copyright and fair use protections, see, e.g., Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use
Standard, 103 Harv. L.Rev. 1105, 1126-28 (1990) (arguing against considering the defendants’ good or bad faith), Harper &
Row directs courts to consider a defendant's bad faith in applying the first statutory factor.

Thus, to the extent that Ross, Martin, or Hochman knew that his access to the manuscript was unauthorized or was
derived from a violation of law or breach of duty, this consideration weighs in favor of plaintiffs. Moreover, it has been
considered relevant within this subfactor that a defendant could have acquired the copyrighted manuscript legitimately; in
this case, the relevant defendants could have paid the requisite fee to enroll in NXIVM's seminars. ' See generally William F.
Patry, The Fair Use Privilege in Copyright Law 109, 130-32 (2d ed.1995). The district court should have more fully and
explicitly considered defendants’ bad faith within its analysis of the first factor and did not. For the purposes of our analysis
here, we assume defendants’ bad faith and weigh this subfactor in favor of plaintiffs.

But just how much weight within the first factor should a court place on this subfactor of bad faith? Some courts have
found Harper & Rowto stand for the broad proposition that ""[t]o invoke the fair use exception, an individual must possess an


--- Page 4 ---
authorized copy of a literary work."" Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of Am. Inc., 975 F.2d 832 , 843 (Fed.Cir.1992). Since we
assume defendants' copy of the NXIVM manuscript was unauthorized, the rule enunciated in Atari would foreclose the fair
use defense altogether based upon defendants’ bad faith.

However, we read Harper & Row's holding more narrowly than the broad proposition suggested byAtari. In Harper &
Row, the defendants knowingly acquired a ""purloined manuscript"" for the very purpose of preempting the plaintiff's

Page 479

first publication rights, rights already sold by the copyright owner, for which the defendants had an opportunity to bid. The
Court wrote that the defendants' ""use had not merely the incidental effect but the intended purpose of supplanting the
copyright holder's commercially valuable right of first publication."" 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . Ultimately, the Court
rejected the fair use defense in Harper & Row, not just because of the defendants’ bad faith, but also because the
defendants had failed to make any substantial transformative use of the copyrighted work. /d. at 543, 105 S.Ct. 2218 . Here,
while NXIVM urges that its first publication rights were similarly ""scoop[ed],"" id. at 542, 556, 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218 ,
defendants' use in this case was quite plainly critical and transformative. See also Chicago Bd. of Educ. v. Substance, Inc.
354 F.3d 624 , 628 (7th Cir.2003) (distinguishing Harper & Rowon the basis that Harper & Rowdid not involve criticism of
the copyrighted work).

Because the Harper & Row Court did not end its analysis of the fair use defense after considering and ascertaining the
defendants' bad faith there, we believe that the bad faith of a defendant is not dispositive of a fair use defense. Instead, we
agree with the court in Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Netcom On-Line Communication Servs., Inc., 923 F.Supp. 1231 , 1244 n. 14
(N.D.Cal.1995), that ""[nJothing in Harper & Rowindicates that [the defendants'] bad faith [is] itself conclusive of the fair use
question, or even of the first factor."" Moreover, ""[a]fter Campbell, it is clear that a finding of bad faith, or a finding on any one
of the four factors, cannot be considered dispositive."" /d.; see also Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (emphasizing
that no single fair use factor is dispositive and warning against the application of ""bright-line rules"" in fair use analysis); 4
Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 13.05[A][1][d] (2003)(noting that ""knowing use of a purloined
manuscript militates against a fair use defense,"" but not suggesting that bad faith is an absolute bar to fair use). 2

Thus, while the subfactor pertaining to defendants’ good or bad faith must be weighed, and while it was error for the
district court not to have fully and explicitly considered it, we find that even if the bad faith subfactor weighs in plaintiffs’ favor,
the first factor still favors defendants in light of the transformative nature of the secondary use as criticism. If no statutory
factor can be dispositive after Campbell, neither can a single subfactor be, a fortiori.

Page 480
2. The ""nature of the copyrighted work"" inquiry

The parties do not dispute that because the copyrighted work is unpublished, the district court properly found the
second factor, ""the nature of the copyrighted work,"" to favor plaintiffs. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564 , 105 S.Ct. 2218
(""The fact that a work is unpublished is a critical element in its ‘nature,"""" and ""the scope of fair use is narrower with respect to
unpublished works."") (citations omitted); but see 17 U.S.C. § 107 (""The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a
finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors."").

3. The ""amount and substantiality"" inquiry

Consideration of the third factor, ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work
as a whole,"" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3), ""has both a quantitative and a qualitative component,"" New Era Pubs. Int'l, ApS v. Carol
Publ'g Group, 904 F.2d 152 , 158 (2d Cir.1990). The factor favors copyright holders where the portion used by the alleged
infringer is a significant percentage of the copyrighted work, or where the portion used is ""essentially the heart of"" the
copyrighted work, Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 565 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts have also
considered ""whether the quantity of the material used was reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" Am.
Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913 , 926 (2d Cir.1994)(internal quotation marks omitted).

The district court found that this factor was ""at best, neutral,"" because: (1) defendants copied from only 17 pages of a
manual 500 pages long; (2) the ""heart"" of the work for which plaintiffs were seeking protection, the actual process or idea of
""Rational Inquiry,"" is not copyrightable expression under 17 U.S.C. § 102(b); and (3), in any event, this ""heart"" could not be
summed up in the 17 pages that were copied. As to (3), the district court essentially found that there was no ""identifiable
core that could be appropriated,"" Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell, 803 F.2d 1253 , 1263 (2d Cir.1986).

NXIVM takes issue with the district court's analysis. First, plaintiffs claim that the district court erred in its counting that
defendants quote from 17 pages of ""over 500 pages of course materials."" NXIVM argues that the proper count is 25 pages
out of a total of 191 pages because the court below mistakenly included in its count schedules, promotional materials, and
duplicated pages, using a Bates-stamping proxy instead of investigating each page.

While plaintiffs are correct that the district court over-counted the denominator (the total number of pages), it is plain
that the district court also substantially over-counted the numerator (the number of pages copied) by attributing as entire


--- Page 5 ---
pages quotes as short as a single sentence. Taking these adjustments into account, the quantity of the copyrightable work
copied does not weigh in favor of plaintiffs.

Second, plaintiffs emphasize that much of defendant Martin's article is simply quotation from plaintiffs' work. They urge
us to consider the ratio of copied material included in Martin's article to original material in the article. However, we decline
to do so; the statutory enumeration of the third factor plainly requires only an analysis ""in relation to the copyrighted work,""
not the infringing work. 17 U.S.C. § 107(3).

Third, plaintiffs offer yet another argument in support of their analysis of the quantity inquiry within the third factor. They
seek to narrow the denominator, the

Page 481

total page count of plaintiffs' work, by conceptualizing the single course manual as separate ""modules,"" each of which they
urge is a separate denominator. NXIVM claims support for this approach citing the United States Copyright Office's
willingness to register copyrights to plaintiffs at the ""module"" level. Applying this analysis, plaintiffs allege that defendants
copied some entire works. Plaintiffs analogize their theory to a defendant who copies individual articles from a magazine
containing separately copyrighted articles. See Am. Geophysical Union,_60 F.3d at 925 . We cannot accept this analogy.

If plaintiffs' argument were accepted by courts — and, not surprisingly, plaintiffs cite no authority to support it — the
third factor could depend ultimately on a plaintiffs cleverness in obtaining copyright protection for the smallest possible unit
of what would otherwise be a series of such units intended as a unitary work. The proper analogy in this case is not to
separate articles in a magazine, but instead to a book by a single author containing numerous chapters, which are not
separately copyrightable. See id. at 925-26 (treating individual articles in a journal as the appropriate level of copyright
protection when the author of each article is different). The ""modules"" in this case were written by the same author and they
combine to produce one unitary work.

Finally, plaintiffs argue that the district court did not engage in the required qualitative analysis at all in looking to see if
defendants copied the core of plaintiffs' work. We agree that from the transcript of Judge McAvoy's decision it is unclear
whether the district court performed this analysis satisfactorily; to the extent that it did not, we fill the gap here and conclude
that the qualitative component of the third factor does not favor plaintiffs.

While Harper & Row found that copying only 300 words of an entire book could capture the ""heart"" of it, 471 U.S. at
564-65 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 , that case arose under distinguishable facts. InHarper & Row, the plaintiffs copyrighted an
autobiography of Gerald Ford that was principally of interest for its treatment of the Watergate scandal. Thus, when the
defendant magazine in that case published, with virtually no commentary, the very section of the book containing Ford's
views on Watergate, the Court could easily identify it as the core of the manuscript.

Here, by contrast, there is no objective core of expression in the course materials that can be similarly identified. Even
plaintiffs reveal their appreciation of this fact when they charge defendants principally with copying the heart of their
""services."" Such services, however, are not copyrightable expression. See 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) (withholding copyright
protection from any ""idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery""). Moreover, by
pressing their ""module"" argument, plaintiffs virtually concede that defendants could not have taken the core of the
copyrighted work, because they do not see the manual as having a core, but rather as an assemblage of ""modules.""

Finally, we agree with the district court that, in order to do the research and analysis necessary to support their critical
commentary, it was reasonably necessary for defendants to quote liberally from NXIVM's manual. Accordingly, we find that
the third factor does not favor plaintiffs.

4. The ""market"" inquiry

The fourth statutory fair use factor requires us to evaluate the economic impact of the allegedly infringing use upon the
copyright owner. The focus here is on whether defendants are offering a market substitute for the original. In considering

Page 482

the fourth factor, our concern is not whether the secondary use suppresses or even destroys the market for the original work
or its potential derivatives, but whether the secondary use usurps the market of the original work. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 593
, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . As we stated in Wright, the relevant market effect with which we are concerned is the market for
plaintiffs""expression,"" and thus it is the effect of defendants’ use of that expression on plaintiffs' market that matters, not the
effect of defendants’ work as a whole. Wright,_953 F.2d at 739 . That the fair use, being transformative, might well harm, or
even destroy, the market for the original is of no concern to us so long as the harm stems from the force of the criticism
offered. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 591-92 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (""[A] lethal parody, like a scathing theater review, kills demand
for the original, [but] does not produce a harm cognizable under the Copyright Act."").

This factor weighs heavily in defendants’ favor. It is plain that, as a general matter, criticisms of a seminar or
organization cannot substitute for the seminar or organization itself or hijack its market. To be sure, some may read
defendants’ materials and decide not to attend plaintiffs’ seminars. Indeed, the record reflects that soon after the
dissemination of defendants’ material, actress Goldie Hawn cancelled a visit with NXIVM's leader, Keith Raniere. But that


--- Page 6 ---
sort of harm, as the district court properly recognized, is not cognizable under the Copyright Act. If criticisms on defendants’
websites kill the demand for plaintiffs’ service, that is the price that, under the First Amendment, must be paid in the open

marketplace for ideas. See, e.g., New Era, 904 F.2d at 160 (citing the ""fundamentally different functions"" of a critique and a

copyrighted original by virtue of their ""opposing viewpoints"") (citing Maxtone-Graham, 803 F.2d at 1264 ); Campbell, 510
U.S. at 591-92 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 .

5. Summary

Recognizing that ""[alll [factors] are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of
copyright,"" Campbell_510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 , and that no one factor should dominate the analysis, the district
court properly denied the preliminary injunction. We agree with the district court that defendants’ writings ""are undoubtedly
transformative secondary uses intended as a form of criticism. All of the alleged harm arises from the biting criticism of this
fair use, not from a usurpation of the market by ... defendants."" Accordingly, we affirm the denial of the preliminary injunction
on the copyright infringement claim because plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits. Even a finding of bad faith by
defendants would not automatically preclude finding that their use was fair use.

C. The Trademark Disparagement Claim

We have carefully considered plaintiffs' arguments that they are entitled to a preliminary injunction on their trademark
disparagement claim and find them to be without merit. ""[T]he touchstone of whether a defendant's actions may be
considered ‘commercial advertising or promotion’ under the Lanham Act is that the contested representations are part of an
organized campaign to penetrate the relevant market.""_Fashion Boutique of Short Hills, Inc. v. Fendi USA, Inc., 314 F.3d 48 ,
57 (2d Cir.2002). As we have already observed in connection with the copyright claim, defendants are not trying to get into
the relevant market that is NXIVM's central business concern. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's rejection of the

Page 483
plaintiffs’ application for a preliminary injunction on their trademark disparagement claim.
Ill. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction is affirmed.

Notes:

1. With the district court, we decline to rule on the enforceability of the particular non-disclosure agreement NXIVM requires its participants to sign;
nothing here turns upon it and the issue is not properly before us. We do note, however, that even if the non-disclosure agreement were enforceable, a
violation of that agreement would be a breach of a contractual duty but would not ipso facto be a copyright infringement. On the other hand, such a
violation of a contractual duty, if it were found to be an enforceable duty, would be relevant in assessing the bad faith subfactor within the first factor.

2. Campbell provides further support for the proposition that while the good or bad faith of a defendant generally should be considered, it generally
contributes little to fair use analysis. See Campbell,_510 U.S. at 585 n. 18, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . In Campbell the Court found, in the context of a parody made
by the defendants, that the defendants’ request for permission to use the original copyrighted work and the plaintiffs' denial of that permission could not
— as an evidentiary matter — be used to show that the defendants believed that their use was not fair. The Court wrote that ""regardless of the weight
one might place on the alleged infringer's state of mind,” and that ""[e]ven if good faith were central to fair use ... being denied permission to use a work
does not weigh against a finding of fair use."" 510 U.S. at 585 n. 18, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citing Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ) (citation
omitted). We believe this analysis further supports our conclusion that a finding of bad faith is not to be weighed very heavily within the first fair use factor
and cannot be made central to fair use analysis. The Court recognized the continuing relevance of Harper & Row, but clarified that the bad faith subfactor
can be de-emphasized and will not be dispositive of the first factor or fair use. We follow Harper & Row and await from the Supreme Court a clearer
renunciation than the Campbell footnote of bad faith's relevance (however attenuated) to the fair use inquiry.

JACOBS, Circuit Judge, concurring:

| concur in the majority opinion and subscribe in nearly all respects to its analysis, with the following further
observations.

The majority opinion assumes that Dr. Ross and his co-defendants may have acquired the NXIVM training manual in
bad faith, and observes that the district court did not explore this question. Even assuming such bad faith, the majority
opinion nonetheless concludes that the defendants’ quotation from the NXIVM original was a fair use protected by § 107.
This is because Ross used the passages from NXIVM's manuals to criticize the original, i.e., with a literary intention and
effect that differed sufficiently from that of the original to be transformative. Accordingly, Dr. Ross' publication of the quoted
material did not enter the marketplace as a potential substitute for NXIVM's original. In the majority's words, ""[al]ll of the
alleged harm arises from the biting criticism of [the defendant's] fair use, not from usurpation of the market"" that properly
belongs to the plaintiff. Maj. Op. at 482.

With all of this | completely agree. The fact that the defendants might have acted in bad faith in acquiring the plaintiff's
material did not bar a finding of fair use. | would go somewhat further. The majority assumed, based on the Supreme Court's
having said so in Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539 , 562-63, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588



--- Page 7 ---
(1985) , that bad faith on the part of secondary users has a proper place in the fair use analysis. The Court's observation in
Harper & Rowwas, however, a make-weight wholly unnecessary to the outcome; rejection of the fair use defense was
compelled by the essential statutory considerations: the defendant took the ""heart"" of the plaintiff's book (the part the public
was most interested in reading), and in so doing, usurped a significant part of its market.

The Supreme Court's most recent consideration of fair use in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 585
n. 18, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) , treats as an open question whether the secondary user's good or bad faith
is pertinent to the fair use inquiry (contrary to its observation in Harper & Row). The present case affords an occasion to
assess whether bad faith on the part of a secondary user plays a productive role in the fair use inquiry. For the reasons that
follow, | think that the secondary user's good or bad faith in gaining access to the original copyrighted material ought to have
no bearing on the availability of a fair use defense. Fair use defines the outer boundary of copyright protection, and that
perimeter should be drawn by reference to the central objectives of copyright. Copyright itself would be distorted if its
contours were made to depend on the morality and good behavior of secondary users.

Twenty years ago in Harper & Row, the Supreme Court held that THE NATION'S scoop of a TIME magazine article
previewing the memoirs of President Ford was an infringement. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 569 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . Although
THE NATION contended that the newsworthiness of its piece compelled a finding of fair use, the article failed every prong of
the fair use statute, 17 U.S.C. § 107: its conceded purpose was to scoop the authorized publication

Page 484

by TIME magazine and thus ""supplant[ ] the copyright holder's commercially valuable right of first publication,"" id. at 562,
105 S.Ct. 2218 ; it appropriated the ""heart"" of the memoir, id. at 564-66, 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; and it ""directly competed for a
share of the market for prepublication excerpts,"" id. at 568, 105 S.Ct. 2218 . In short, Harper & Rowwas not a close case.
Nevertheless, in its review of the ""purpose and character"" of THE NATION'S infringement, the Court made the additional
observation that [flair use presupposes good faith and fair dealing"" and noted the district court's finding that ""The Nation
knowingly exploited a purloined manuscript"" to get its scoop. /d. at 562-63, 105 S.Ct. 2218 .

However, when the Supreme Court next considered fair use, in a challenge to 2 Live Crew's pop parody of a Roy
Orbison song, the pertinence of bad faith was treated as an open question, not as a point settled by Harper & Row:

[R]egardless of the weight one might place on the alleged infringer's state of mind, compare Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at
562 [], 105 S.Ct. 2218 (fair use presupposes good faith and fair dealing) (quotation marks omitted), with Folsom v. Marsh, 9
F.Cas. 342, 349 (No. 4,901) (C.C.D.Mass.1841) (good faith does not bar a finding of infringement); [Pierre N.] Leval, [
Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L.Rev. at] 1126-27 (good faith irrelevant to fair use analysis), we reject [the]
argument that 2 Live Crew's request for permission to use the original should be weighed against a finding of fair use. Even
if good faith were central to fair use, 2 Live Crew's actions do not necessarily suggest that they believed their version was
not fair use.... If the use is otherwise fair, then no permission need be sought or granted.

Campbell, 510 U.S. at 585 n. 18, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (emphasis added). In opposition to Harper & Row's assumption that
""fair use presupposes good faith and fair dealing,"" the Campbell footnote highlighted the seemingly contrary inference of
Justice Story's classic statement of the fair use principles in Folsom, as well as an often-cited study that questions whether
good faith should be weighed in the balancing of ""the social benefit of a transformative secondary use against injury to the
incentives of authorship."" Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L.Rev. 1105, 1126-27 (1990) (""Leval |"").
Campbell's contrary-to-fact phrasing — ""[e]ven if good faith were central to fair use"" — rather suggests that it should not.

So, even if Harper & Rowdid state in passing that fair use presupposes good faith, Campbell reopened the question.
See, e.g., Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Netcom On-Line Communication Servs., Inc., 923 F.Supp. 1231 , 1244 n. 14
(N.D.Cal.1995) ("" Campbell ... hardly endorses the good faith requirement.""). Campbell 's footnoted discussion questioning
the pertinence of good faith reinforces the entire thrust of the decision, which requires that fair use be assessed primarily in
light of whether the secondary work quotes the original with a transformative purpose and whether it usurps a market that
properly belongs to the original author — issues as to which the defendant's good faith in accessing the plaintiff's original
work does not matter.

Campbell reinvigorated the doctrine, paramount since at least Justice Story's opinion in Folsom v. Marsh, 9 F.Cas. 342
(C.C.D.Mass.1841) (No. 4,901), that the fair use defense exists to encourage the creation of original works that do not
""supersede the objects"" — and thus the market

Page 485

value — of the original. 510 U.S. at 576 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting Folsom, 9 F.Cas. at 348); see also Pierre N. Leval,
Nimmer Lecture: Fair Use Rescued, 44 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 1449, 1465 (1997) (""Leval Il"") (""| Campbell] revives the


--- Page 8 ---
transformative-superseding dichotomy as the dominant consideration."").

Fair use is not a doctrine that exists by sufferance, or that is earned by good works and clean morals; it is a right —
codified in § 107 and recognized since shortly after the Statute of Anne — that is ""necessary to fulfill copyright's very
purpose, ‘[t]o promote the Progress of science and the useful arts....'"""" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting
U.S. Const., art. |, § 8, cl. 8). The fair use doctrine "" requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute"" when it
""would stifle the very creativity which that law was designed to foster."" /d. at 577, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (emphasis added) (citation,
internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted); see also, Leval Il, 44 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. at 1465. The main purpose of the
first-factor inquiry under § 107 is to see whether the new work merely supersedes the original or ""instead ... is
“transformative.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578-79 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting Leval |, 103 Harv. L. Rev at 1111). Two closely-
related inquiries are crucial: Does the secondary work quote or copy the first with the same literary intention as the original
or with a new, transformative purpose? Does the secondary work usurp some of the market for the first by serving as an
alternate means of acquiring the quoted material? As Campbell pointed out, these inquiries, specified in the first and fourth
listed factors of § 107, are correlated: the greater the transformative purpose of the secondary use, the less potential
purchasers will see it as an alternative means of acquiring the original. See id. at 591, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Similarly, the more
the secondary work quotes the original to communicate an identical message or purpose, the more likely it is that potential
purchasers will see the secondary work as an alternate means of acquiring the first — in which case, the secondary work will
likely usurp the original's rightful market. The bad faith of the secondary user in gaining access to the original author's
material has no rational bearing on those crucial interrelated inquiries. See Leval |, 103 Harv. L.Rev. at 1126. A person who
acquires the original work by crooked or unsavory means may expose himself to all sorts of civil claims and criminal
charges; but the question of fair use itself should be decided on the basis of the transformative character and commercial
effects of the secondary use. If the use satisfies the criteria of § 107, it is fair because it advances the utilitarian goals of
copyright.

It might seem that it can never hurt to put bad faith at a disadvantage. But copyright is not about virtue; it is about the
encouragement of creative output, including the output of transformative quotation. Its goals are not advanced if bad faith
can defeat a fair use defense. The limited monopoly bestowed by the copyright statute ""is intended to motivate the creative
activity of authors and inventors, by the provision of a special reward, and to allow the public access to the products of their
genius after the limited period of exclusive control has expired."" Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S.
417 , 429, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) . Though the statute allows a copyright holder to recover damages
suffered at the hands of an infringer, see, e.g., 17 U.S.C. § 504 (1996), the reward to be gained (or the loss suffered) is a
""secondary consideration"" in the copyright scheme; its ""primary object ... lies in the general benefits derived by the public
from the labors of authors."" See United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131 , 158,68 S.Ct. 915 , 92 L.Ed. 1260

Page 486

(1948) (quoting Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U.S. 123 , 127,52 S.Ct. 546 , 76 L.Ed. 1010 (1932) ).

In Campbell, the Court affirmed that the fair use defense exists to further these same goals; it is not, as its label may
connote, a privilege conferred on the well-intentioned. Fair play is no defense to infringement, see, e.g., Folsom, 9 F.Cas. at
349 (finding infringement despite having ""no doubt [] that [defendant's copying was] deemed [by him] a perfectly lawful and
justifiable use of the plaintiff's work""), and bad faith should be no obstacle to fair use. Thus a hotelier who stocks each room
with photocopies of a newly copyrighted translation of the Bible is not saved from infringement by his piety; similarly, a movie
reviewer who critiques — and reveals — a surprise ending is not deprived of the fair use defense by his malice or spite. Nor
should a book critic be denied the fair use protection because she gained access to a prepublication manuscript by deceit.
Fair use is not a permitted infringement; it lies wholly outside the domain protected by the author's copyright.

Bad faith is a slippery concept in the copyright context. It (i) is difficult to define, (ii) may be impossible to detect, and (iii)
given weight, may lead to the suppression of transformative works that are valuable to the expansion of public knowledge.
In deciding whether to publish a work derived from copyrighted source material, a publisher ought to be able to make a
judgment based solely on a comparison of the two works in light of market conditions, as indicated by the factors expressly
set out in § 107. The goals of copyright are disserved if publishers (and editors) risk liability on the basis of the (often
unknown or unsuspected) tactics and morals of authors who produce transformative works. Incremental risks drive up the
cost of publication, thus the prudent publisher may elect to forgo a new work altogether if the good faith of the creator cannot
be assured. And when bad faith is apparent or discovered, an otherwise transformative work will not be published at all — a
result in tension (at least) with the public good that copyright exists to promote. See Sony, 464 U.S. at 429-34 , 104 S.Ct.
774 .""The monopoly privileges that Congress may authorize [pursuant to Article |, section 8] are neither unlimited nor
primarily designed to provide a special private benefit ... [and anyone] who makes a fair use of the work is notan infringer of
the copyright with respect to such use."" /d. at 429, 433, 104 S.Ct. 774 (emphasis added).

Not unreasonably, the majority opinion considers us bound by Harper & Row. That case undoubtedly said that ""fair use
presupposes good faith and fair dealing,"" an observation that the Supreme Court has never expressly disavowed.

Nonetheless, the Campbell footnote invites and provokes discussion of the issue as an open question where it may arise.

This case illustrates why bad faith on the part of the secondary user should not be factored into the fair use analysis.

Dr. Ross and his co-defendants quoted from NXIVM's manual to show that it is the pretentious nonsense of a cult. Potential
purchasers of NXIVM's services will not buy the secondary work as an alternative means of acquiring the material quoted
from the original; the secondary articles therefore do not usurp or supersede a market that properly belongs to NXIVM.
Certainly, no critic should need an author's permission to make such criticism, regardless of how he came by the original;
nor should publication be inhibited by a publisher's anxiety or uncertainty about an author's ethics if his secondary work is

transformative. The majority opinion thus properly affirms the district court's finding of fair use, notwithstanding the
possibility that the defendant might have obtained the plaintiff's materials by an act of deception or otherwise in bad faith.

OPINION

TALLMAN, Circuit Judge:

Stephanie Lenz filed suit under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) —part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”)—against
Universal Music Corp., Universal Music Publishing, Inc., and Universal Music Publishing Group (collectively “Universal”).
She alleges Universal misrepresented in a takedown notification that her 29-second home video (the “video”) constituted an
infringing use of a portion of a composition by the Artist known as Prince, which Universal insists was unauthorized by the
law. Her claim boils down to a question of whether copyright holders have been abusing the extrajudicial takedown
procedures provided for in the DMCA by declining to first evaluate whether the content qualifies as fair use. We hold that the
statute requires copyright holders to consider fair use before sending a takedown notification, and that failure to do so raises
a triable issue as to whether the copyright holder formed a subjective good faith belief that the use was not authorized by
law. We affirm the denial of the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.

Founded in May 2005, YouTube (now owned by Google) operates a website that hosts user-generated content. About
YouTube, YouTube.com, https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/ (last visited September 4, 2015). Users upload videos directly
to the website. /d. On February 7, 2007, Lenz uploaded to YouTube a 29-second home video of her two young children in
the family kitchen dancing to the song Let's Go Crazy by Prince. + Available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=N1KfJHFWIhQ (last visited September 4, 2015). She titled the video “ ‘Let's Go Crazy’ # 1.” About four seconds into the
video, Lenz asks her thirteen month-old son “what do you think of the music?” after which he bobs up and down while
holding a push toy.


--- Page 2 ---
At the time Lenz posted the video, Universal was Prince's publishing administrator responsible for enforcing his copyrights.
To accomplish this objective with respect to YouTube, Robert Allen, Universal's head of business affairs, assigned Sean
Johnson, an assistant in the legal department, to monitor YouTube on a daily basis. Johnson searched YouTube for Prince's
songs and reviewed the video postings returned by his online search query. When reviewing such videos, he evaluated
whether they “embodied a Prince composition” by making “significant use of ... the composition, specifically if the song was
recognizable, was in a significant portion of the video or was the focus of the video.” According to Allen, “[t]he general
guidelines are that ... we review the video to ensure that the composition was the focus and if it was we then notify YouTube
that the video should be removed.”

Johnson contrasted videos that met this criteria to those “that may have had a second or less of a Prince song, literally a one
line, half line of Prince song” or “were shot in incredibly noisy environments, such as bars, where there could be a Prince
song playing deep in the background ... to the point where if there was any Prince composition embodied ... in those videos
that it was distorted beyond reasonable recognition.” None of the video evaluation guidelines explicitly include consideration
of the fair use doctrine.

[801 F.3d 1130]

When Johnson reviewed Lenz's video, he recognized Let's Go Crazy immediately. He noted that it played loudly in the
background throughout the entire video. Based on these details, the video's title, and Lenz's query during the video asking if
her son liked the song, he concluded that Prince's song “was very much the focus of the video.” As a result, Johnson
decided the video should be included in a takedown notification sent to YouTube that listed more than 200 YouTube videos
Universal believed to be making unauthorized use of Prince's songs. 2 The notice included a “good faith belief” statement as
required by 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A)(v) : “We have a good faith belief that the above-described activity is not authorized by
he copyright owner, its agent, or the law.”

After receiving the takedown notification, YouTube removed the video and sent Lenz an email on June 5, 2007, notifying her
of the removal. On June 7, 2007, Lenz attempted to restore the video by sending a counter-notification to YouTube pursuant
0 § 512(g)(3). After YouTube provided this counter-notification to Universal per § 512(g)(2)(B), Universal protested the
video's reinstatement because Lenz failed to properly acknowledge that her statement was made under penalty of perjury,
as required by § 512(g)(3)(C). Universal's protest reiterated that the video constituted infringement because there was no
record that “either she or YouTube were ever granted licenses to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform or otherwise exploit
he Composition.” The protest made no mention of fair use. After obtaining pro bono counsel, Lenz sent a second counter-
notification on June 27, 2007, which resulted in YouTube's reinstatement of the video in mid-July.

Lenz filed the instant action on July 24, 2007, and her Amended Complaint on August 15, 2007. After the district court
dismissed her tortious interference claim and request for declaratory relief, Lenz filed her Second Amended Complaint on
April 18, 2008, alleging only a claim for misrepresentation under § 512(f). The district court denied Universal's motion to
dismiss the action.

On February 25, 2010, the district court granted Lenz's partial motion for summary judgment on Universal's six affirmative
defenses, including the third affirmative defense that Lenz suffered no damages. Both parties subsequently moved for
summary judgment on Lenz's § 512(f) misrepresentation claim. On January 24, 2013, the district court denied both motions
in an order that is now before us.

The district court certified its summary judgment order for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), and stayed
proceedings in district court pending resolution of the appeal. We granted the parties permission to bring an interlocutory
appeal.

We review de novo the district court's denial of summary judgment. When doing so, we “must determine whether the
evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, presents any genuine issues of material fact and whether
the district court correctly applied the law.” Warren v. City of Carlsbad, 58 F.3d 439 , 441 (9th Cir.1995). On cross-motions
for summary judgment, we evaluate each motion independently, “giving the nonmoving

[801 F.3d 1131]

party in each instance the benefit of all reasonable inferences.” ACLU v. City of Las Vegas, 333 F.3d 1092 , 1097 (9th
Cir.2003).

When evaluating an interlocutory appeal, we “may address any issue fairly included within the certified order because it is
the order that is appealable, and not the controlling question identified by the district court.” Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A. v.
Calhoun, 516 U.S. 199 , 205, 116 S.Ct. 619 , 133 L.Ed.2d 578 (1996) (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted). We may
therefore “address those issues material to the order from which appeal has been taken.” /n re Cinematronics, Inc., 916 F.2d
1444 , 1449 (9th Cir.1990) (emphasis in original) (permitting appellate review of a ruling issued prior to the order certified for
interlocutory appeal).

IV

Effective on October 28, 1998, the DMCA added new sections to existing copyright law by enacting five Titles, only one of
which is relevant here: Title II—Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act—now codified in 17 U.S.C. § 512.
Sections 512(c), (f), and (g) are at the heart of the parties’ dispute.

A

Section 512(c) permits service providers, e.g., YouTube or Google, to avoid copyright infringement liability for storing users’
content if—among other requirements—the service provider “expeditiously” removes or disables access to the content after
receiving notification from a copyright holder that the content is infringing. 17 U.S.C. § 512(c). Section 512(c)(3)(A) sets forth
the elements that such a “takedown notification” must contain. These elements include identification of the copyrighted work,
identification of the allegedly infringing material, and, critically, a statement that the copyright holder believes in good faith
the infringing material “is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.” Id. § 512(c)(3)(A). The procedures
outlined in § 512(c) are referred to as the DMCA's “takedown procedures.”

To avoid liability for disabling or removing content, the service provider must notify the user of the takedown. /d. § 512(g)(1)-
(2). The user then has the option of restoring the content by sending a counter-notification, which must include a statement
of “good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification....” Id. § 512(g)(3)
(C). Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, the service provider must inform the copyright holder of the counter-
notification and restore the content within “not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days,” unless the service provider
receives notice that the copyright holder has filed a lawsuit against the user seeking to restrain the user's infringing
behavior. /d. § 512(g)(2)(B)-(C). The procedures outlined in § 512(g) are referred to as the DMCA's “put-back procedures.”

If an entity abuses the DMCA, it may be subject to liability under § 512(f). That section provides: “Any person who knowingly
materially misrepresents under this section—(1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was
removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages....” /d. § 512(f). Subsection (1) generally
applies to copyright holders and subsection (2) generally applies to users. Only subsection (1) is at issue here.

We must first determine whether 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A)(v) requires copyright holders to consider whether the potentially
infringing material is a fair use of a copyright under 17 U.S.C. § 107 before

[801 F.3d 1132]

issuing a takedown notification. Section 512(c)(3)(A)(v) requires a takedown notification to include a “statement that the
complaining party has a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
copyright owner, its agent, or the law.” The parties dispute whether fair use is an authorization under the law as
contemplated by the statute—which is so far as we know an issue of first impression in any circuit across the nation.
“Canons of statutory construction dictate that if the language of a statute is clear, we look no further than that language in
determining the statute's meaning.... A court looks to legislative history only if the statute is unclear.” United States v. Lewis
67 F.3d 225 , 228-29 (9th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). We agree with the district court and hold that the statute
unambiguously contemplates fair use as a use authorized by the law.

Fair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by the law. In 1976, Congress codified the application of a
four-step test for determining the fair use of copyrighted works:

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, ... for purposes such
as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or
research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular
case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon
consideration of all the above factors.

17 U.S.C. § 107 (emphasis added). The statute explains that the fair use of a copyrighted work is permissible because it is a
non-infringing use.

While Title 17 of the United States Code (“Copyrights”) does not define the term “authorize” or “authorized,” “[w]hen there is
no indication that Congress intended a specific legal meaning for the term, the court may look to sources such as


--- Page 4 ---
dictionaries for a definition.” United States v. Mohrbacher, 182 F.3d 1041 , 1048 (9th Cir.1999). Black's Law Dictionary
defines “authorize” as “1. To give legal authority; to empower” and “2. To formally approve; to sanction.” Authorize, Black's
Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014). Because 17 U.S.C. § 107 both “empowers” and “formally approves” the use of copyrighted
material if the use constitutes fair use, fair use is “authorized by the law” within the meaning of § 512(c). See also 17 U.S.C.
§ 108(f)(4) (“Nothing in this section in any way affects the right of fair use as provided by section 107....” (emphasis added)).

Universal's sole textual argument is that fair use is not “authorized by the law” because it is an affirmative defense that
excuses otherwise infringing conduct. Universal's interpretation is incorrect as it conflates two different concepts: an
affirmative defense that is labeled as such due to the procedural posture of the case, and an affirmative defense that
excuses impermissible conduct. Supreme Court precedent squarely supports the conclusion that

801 F.3d 1133]

air use does not fall into the latter camp: “[A]nyone who ... makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright
with respect to such use.” Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 433, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d
574 (1984) .

Given that 17 U.S.C. § 107 expressly authorizes fair use, labeling it as an affirmative defense that excuses conduct is a
misnomer:

Although the traditional approach is to view “fair use” as an affirmative defense, ... it is better viewed as a right
granted by the Copyright Act of 1976. Originally, as a judicial doctrine without any statutory basis, fair use was an
infringement that was excused—this is presumably why it was treated as a defense. As a statutory doctrine,
however, fair use is not an infringement. Thus, since the passage of the 1976 Act, fair use should no longer be
considered an infringement to be excused; instead, it is logical to view fair use as a right. Regardless of how fair
use is viewed, it is clear that the burden of proving fair use is always on the putative infringer.

Bateman v. Mnemonics, Inc., 79 F.3d 1532 , 1542 n. 22 (11th Cir.1996) ;cf. Lydia Pallas Loren, Fair Use: An Affirmative
Defense ?, 90 Wash. L.Rev. 685, 688 (2015) (“Congress did not intend fair use to be an affirmative defense—a defense,
yes, but not an affirmative defense.”). Fair use is therefore distinct from affirmative defenses where a use infringes a
copyright, but there is no liability due to a valid excuse, e.g., misuse of a copyright,_Practice Management Information Corp.
v. American Medical Ass'n, 121 F.3d 516 , 520 (9th Cir.1997), and laches, Danjag LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942 , 950—
51 (9th Cir.2001).

Universal concedes it must give due consideration to other uses authorized by law such as compulsory licenses. The
introductory language in 17 U.S.C. § 112 for compulsory licenses closely mirrors that in the fair use statute. Compare 17
U.S.C. § 112(a)(1) (“Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, ... it is not an infringement of copyright for a transmitting
organization entitled to transmit to the public a performance or display of a work ... to make no more than one copy or
phonorecord of a particular transmission program embodying the performance or display....”), with id. § 107
(‘Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work ... is not an infringement of
copyright.”). That fair use may be labeled as an affirmative defense due to the procedural posture of the case is no different
than labeling a license an affirmative defense for the same reason. Compare Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S.
569 , 573 &n. 3, 590,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (stating that “fair use is an affirmative defense” where the
district court converted a motion to dismiss based on fair use into a motion for summary judgment), with A & M Records, Inc.
v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 , 1025-26 (9th Cir.2001) (“Napster contends that ... the district court improperly rejected
valid affirmative defenses of ... implied license....”). Thus, Universal's argument that it need not consider fair use in addition
to compulsory licenses rings hollow.

Even if, as Universal urges, fair use is classified as an “ affirmative defense,” we hold—for the purposes of the DMCA—fair
use is uniquely situated in copyright law so as to be treated differently than traditional affirmative defenses. We conclude that
because 17 U.S.C. § 107 created a type of non-infringing use, fair use is “authorized by the law” and a copyright holder must
consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c).

[801 F.3d 1134]
c

We must next determine if a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Universal knowingly misrepresented that it
had formed a good faith belief the video did not constitute fair use. This inquiry lies not in whether a court would adjudge the
video as a fair use, but whether Universal formed a good faith belief that it was not. Contrary to the district court's holding,
Lenz may proceed under an actual knowledge theory, but not under a willful blindness theory.

1

Though Lenz argues Universal should have known the video qualifies for fair use as a matter of law, our court has already
decided a copyright holder need only form a subjective good faith belief that a use is not authorized. Rossi v. Motion Picture
Ass'n of Am. Inc., 391 F.3d 1000 (9th Cir.2004) . In Rossi, we explicitly held that “the ‘good faith belief’ requirement in §
512(c)(3)(A)(v) encompasses a subjective, rather than objective standard.” /d. at 1004. We further held:



--- Page 5 ---
In § 512(f), Congress included an expressly limited cause of action for improper infringement notifications,
imposing liability only if the copyright owner's notification is a knowing misrepresentation. A copyright owner
cannot be liable simply because an unknowing mistake is made, even if the copyright owner acted unreasonably
in making the mistake. Rather, there must be a demonstration of some actual knowledge of misrepresentation on
the part of the copyright owner.

Id. at 1004—05 (citations omitted). Neither of these holdings are dictum. See United States v. Johnson, 256 F.3d 895 , 914
(9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (“[W]here a panel confronts an issue germane to the eventual resolution of the case, and resolves it
after reasoned consideration in a published opinion, that ruling becomes the law of the circuit, regardless of whether doing
so is necessary in some strict logical sense.”).

As a result, Lenz's request to impose a subjective standard only with respect to factual beliefs and an objective standard
with respect to legal determinations is untenable. Such a request grafts an objective standard onto § 512(c)(3)(A)(v) directly
in contravention to Rossi. See Rossi,391 F.3d at 1004 (“When enacting the DMCA, Congress could have easily
incorporated an objective standard of reasonableness. The fact that it did not do so indicates an intent to adhere to the
subjective standard traditionally associated with a good faith requirement.”). We therefore judge Universal's actions by the
subjective beliefs it formed about the video.

2

Universal faces liability if it knowingly misrepresented in the takedown notification that it had formed a good faith belief the
video was not authorized by the law, i.e., did not constitute fair use. Here, Lenz presented evidence that Universal did not
orm any subjective belief about the video's fair use—one way or another—because it failed to consider fair use at all, and
knew that it failed to do so. Universal nevertheless contends that its procedures, while not formally labeled consideration of
air use, were tantamount to such consideration. Because the DMCA requires consideration of fair use prior to sending a
akedown notification, a jury must determine whether Universal's actions were sufficient to form a subjective good faith belief
about the video's fair use or lack thereof.

To be clear, if a copyright holder ignores or neglects our unequivocal holding that it must consider fair use before sending a
akedown notification, it is liable for damages under § 512(f). If, however, a copyright

801 F.3d 1135]

holder forms a subjective good faith belief the allegedly infringing material does not constitute fair use, we are in no position
0 dispute the copyright holder's belief even if we would have reached the opposite conclusion. A copyright holder who pays
lip service to the consideration of fair use by claiming it formed a good faith belief when there is evidence to the contrary is
still subject to § 512(f) liability. Cf, Disney Enters., Inc. v. Hotfile Corp., No. 11-cv-20427, 2013 WL 6336286, at *48 (S.D.Fla.
Sept. 20, 2013) (denying summary judgment of § 512(f) counterclaim due to “sufficient evidence in the record to suggest that
Plaintiff] Warner intentionally targeted files it knew it had no right to remove”); Rosen v. Hosting Servs., Inc., 771 F.Supp.2d
1219 , 1223 (C.D.Cal.2010) (denying summary judgment of § 512(f) counterclaim where the takedown notification listed four
URL links that did not contain content matching the description of the purportedly infringed material); Online Policy Grp. v.
Diebold, Inc., 337 F.Supp.2d 1195 , 1204-05 (N.D.Cal.2004) (“[T]here is no genuine issue of fact that Diebold knew—and
indeed that it specifically intended—that its letters to OPG and Swarthmore would result in prevention of publication of that
content.... The fact that Diebold never actually brought suit against any alleged infringer suggests strongly that Diebold
sought to use the DMCA's safe harbor provisions—which were designed to protect ISPs, not copyright holders—as a sword
to suppress publication of embarrassing content rather than as a shield to protect its intellectual property.”).

In order to comply with the strictures of § 512(c)(3)(A)(v), a copyright holder's consideration of fair use need not be
searching or intensive. We follow Rossi's guidance that formation of a subjective good faith belief does not require
investigation of the allegedly infringing content. See 391 F.3d at 1003 , 1005. We are mindful of the pressing crush of
voluminous infringing content that copyright holders face in a digital age. But that does not excuse a failure to comply with
the procedures outlined by Congress. Cf. Lenz, 572 F.Supp.2d at 1155 (“[I]n the majority of cases, a consideration of fair use
prior to issuing a takedown notice will not be so complicated as to jeopardize a copyright owner's ability to respond rapidly to
potential infringements. The DMCA already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing
material prior to sending a takedown notice; indeed, it would be impossible to meet any of the requirements of Section
512(c) without doing so. A consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review.”).

We note, without passing judgment, that the implementation of computer algorithms appears to be a valid and good faith
middle ground for processing a plethora of content while still meeting the DMCA's requirements to somehow consider fair
use. Cf. Hotfile, 2013 WL 6336286, at *47 (“The Court ... is unaware of any decision to date that actually addressed the
need for human review, and the statute does not specify how belief of infringement may be formed or what knowledge may
be chargeable to the notifying entity.”). For example, consideration of fair use may be sufficient if copyright holders utilize
computer programs that automatically identify for takedown notifications content where: “(1) the video track matches the
video track of a copyrighted work submitted by a content owner; (2) the audio track matches the audio track of that same
copyrighted work; and (3) nearly the entirety ... is comprised of a single copyrighted work.” Brief for The Org. for

Copyright holders could then employ individuals like Johnson to review the minimal remaining content a computer program
does not cull. See Brief for The Recording Indus. Ass'n of Am. as Amici Curiae Supporting Appellants at 15 (“[T]he RIAA has
an entire department dedicated to identifying infringement and issuing takedown requests.”); see also Hottfile, 2013 WL
6336286, at *14. During oral argument Universal explained that service providers now use screening algorithms. However,
we need not definitively decide the issue here because Universal did not proffer any evidence that—at the time it sent the
takedown notification to Lenz—it used a computer program to identify potentially infringing content.

We hold the willful blindness doctrine may be used to determine whether a copyright holder “knowingly materially
misrepresent[ed]” that it held a “good faith belief” the offending activity was not a fair use. See 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A)(v),
(f). “[T]he willful blindness doctrine may be applied, in appropriate circumstances, to demonstrate knowledge or awareness
of specific instances of infringement under the DMCA.” Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc.. 676 F.3d 19 , 35 (2d Cir.2012)
(interpreting how a party can establish the “actual knowledge”—a subjective belief—required by § 512(c)(1)(A)(I) ); see also
UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Shelter Capital Partners LLC, 718 F.3d 1006 , 1023 (9th Cir.2013) (“Of course, a service provider
cannot willfully bury its head in the sand to avoid obtaining such specific knowledge.” (citing Viacom,676 F.3d at 31 )). But,
based on the specific facts presented during summary judgment, we reject the district court's conclusion that Lenz may
proceed to trial under a willful blindness theory.

To demonstrate willful blindness a plaintiff must establish two factors: “(1) the defendant must subjectively believe that there
is a high probability that a fact exists and (2) the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.”
Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 563 U.S. 754 , 131 S.Ct. 2060 2070, 179 L.Ed.2d 1167 (2011) . “Under this
formulation, a willfully blind defendant is one who takes deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of
wrongdoing and who can almost be said to have actually known the critical facts.” /d. at 2070-71. To meet the Global-Tech
test, Lenz must demonstrate a genuine issue as to whether—before sending the takedown notification—Universal (1)
subjectively believed there was a high probability that the video constituted fair use, and (2) took deliberate actions to avoid
learning of this fair use.

On summary judgment Lenz failed to meet a threshold showing of the first factor. To make such a showing, Lenz must
provide evidence from which a juror could infer that Universal was aware of a high probability the video constituted fair use.
See United States v. Yi, 704 F.3d 800 , 805 (9th Cir.2013). But she failed to provide any such evidence. The district court
therefore correctly found that “Lenz does not present evidence suggesting Universal subjectively believed either that there
was a high probability any given video might make fair use of a Prince composition or her video in particular made fair use
of Prince's song ‘Let's Go Crazy.’” Yet the district court improperly denied Universal's motion for summary judgment on the
willful blindness theory because Universal “has not shown that it Jacked a subjective belief.” By finding blame with
Universal's inability to show that it “ Jacked a subjective belief,” the district court improperly required Universal

[801 F.3d 1137]

to meet its burden of persuasion, even though Lenz had failed to counter the initial burden of production that Universal
successfully carried. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 , 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) ; Nissan Fire

& Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099 , 1102 (9th Cir.2000). Lenz may not therefore proceed to trial on a willful
blindness theory.

Section 512(f) provides for the recovery of “any damages, including costs and attorneys|'] fees, incurred by the alleged
infringer ... who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such
misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing....” 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).
We hold a plaintiff may seek recovery of nominal damages for an injury incurred as a result of a § 512(f) misrepresentation.

Universal incorrectly asserts that Lenz must demonstrate she incurred “actual monetary loss.” Section 512(k) provides a
definition for “monetary relief” as “damages, costs, attorneys['] fees, and any other form of monetary payment.” The term
“monetary relief” appears in § 512(a), (b)(1), (c)(1), and (d), but is notably absent from § 512(f). As a result, the damages an
alleged infringer may recover under § 512(f) from “any person” are broader than monetary relief. 2 Cf. United States v.
James, 478 U.S. 597 , 605, 106 S.Ct. 3116 , 92 L.Ed.2d 483 (1986) (“Congress' choice of the language ‘ any damage  ...
undercuts a narrow construction.”), abrogated on other grounds by Cent. Green Co. v. United States, 531 U.S. 425 , 121
S.Ct. 1005 , 148 L.Ed.2d 919 (2001) . Because Congress specified the recovery of “any damages,” we reject Universal's
contention that Congress did not indicate its intent to depart from the common law presumption that a misrepresentation
plaintiff must have suffered a monetary loss. See Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U.S. 200 , 208,113 S.Ct. 2035 , 124
L.Ed.2d 118 (1993) (“Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another, it is
generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” (quotation
omitted)).



--- Page 7 ---
Lenz may seek recovery of nominal damages due to an unquantifiable harm suffered as a result of Universal's actions. 4 The
DMCA is akin to a statutorily created intentional tort whereby an individual may recover nominal damages for a “knowingly
material misrepresent[ation] under this section [512].” 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) ; cf, Memphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477
U.S. 299 , 305, 106 S.Ct. 2537 , 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986) (“We have repeatedly noted that 42 U.S.C. § 1983 creates a species
of tort liability in favor of persons who are deprived of rights, privileges, or immunities secured to them by the Constitution.
Accordingly, when § 1983 plaintiffs seek damages for violations of constitutional rights, the level of damages is ordinarily
determined according to principles derived from the common law of torts.” (quotation and citations omitted)).

“In a number of common law actions associated with intentional torts, the violation of the plaintiff's right has generally
[801 F.3d 1138]

been regarded as a kind of legal damage in itself. The plaintiff who proves an intentional physical tort to the person or to

property can always recover nominal damages.” 3 Dan B. Dobbs et al., The Law of Torts § 480 (2d ed.2011). The tort need
not be physical in order to recover nominal damages. Defamation, for example, permits the recovery of nominal damages:

A nominal damage award can be justified in a tort action only if there is some reason for awarding a judgment in
favor of a claimant who has not proved or does not claim a compensable loss with sufficient certainty to justify a
recovery of compensatory or actual damages. There may be such a reason in an action for defamation, since a
nominal damage award serves the purpose of vindicating the plaintiff's character by a verdict of the jury that
establishes the falsity of the defamatory matter.

W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts § 116A, at 845 (5th ed.1984). Also, individuals may recover nominal
damages for trespass to land, even though the trespasser's “presence on the land causes no harm to the land [or] its
possessor....” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 163 & cmts. d, e (1965).

The district court therefore properly concluded in its 2010 order:

The use of “any damages” suggests strongly Congressional intent that recovery be available for damages even if
they do not amount to ... substantial economic damages.... Requiring a plaintiff who can [show that the copyright
holder knowingly misrepresented its subjective good faith] to demonstrate in addition not only that she suffered
damages but also that those damages were economic and substantial would vitiate the deterrent effect of the
statute.

Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., No. C 07-3783 JF, 2010 WL 702466, at *10 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 25, 2010). Relying on this
opinion, the Southern District of Florida held the same. Hotfile, 2013 WL 6336286, at *48 (“[T]he Court observes that the
quantity of economic damages to Hotfile's system is necessarily difficult to measure with precision and has led to much
disagreement between the parties and their experts. Notwithstanding this difficulty, the fact of injury has been shown, and
Hotfile's expert can provide the jury with a non-speculative basis to assess damages.”).

We agree that Lenz may vindicate her statutorily created rights by seeking nominal damages. Because a jury has not yet
determined whether Lenz will prevail at trial, we need not decide the scope of recoverable damages, i.e., whether she may
recover expenses following the initiation of her § 512(f) suit or pro bono costs and attorneys' fees, both of which arose as a
result of the injury incurred.

Copyright holders cannot shirk their duty to consider—in good faith and prior to sending a takedown notification—whether
allegedly infringing material constitutes fair use, a use which the DMCA plainly contemplates as authorized by the law. That
this step imposes responsibility on copyright holders is not a reason for us to reject it. Cf. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n v.
GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102 , 123-24, 100 S.Ct. 2051 , 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980) ( “[A]ny increased burdens imposed on
the Commission as a result of its compliance with [the Consumer Product Safety Act] were intended by Congress in striking
an appropriate balance between the interests of consumers and the need for fairness and accuracy with respect to
information disclosed by the Commission. Thus, petitioners’ claim that the Commission's compliance with the requirements
of [the Act] will impose undue burdens on the Commission is properly addressed to Congress,

[801 F.3d 1139]

not to this Court.”). We affirm the district court's order denying the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.
AFFIRMED. Each party shall bear its own costs.

M. SMITH, Circuit Judge, concurring in part, dissenting in part, and concurring in the judgment:

| concur in all but Part IV.C of the majority opinion, and concur in the judgment. Because | disagree with the majority's
approach to three issues, | respectfully dissent from Part IV.C.

First, | question whether § 512(f) directly prohibits a party from misrepresenting that it has formed a good faith belief that a
work is subject to the fair use doctrine. | construe the plain text of the statute to prohibit misrepresentations that a work is
infringing, not misrepresentations about the party's diligence in forming its belief that the work is infringing. Second, |


--- Page 8 ---
disagree that there is any material dispute about whether Universal considered fair use. Because Universal did not consider
fair use, it may be held liable for “knowingly” misrepresenting that the video was infringing, if it should be determined that the
video is a non-infringing fair use. Universal's misrepresentation, if any, was knowing because Universal knew it had not
considered fair use, and therefore knew it lacked a basis to conclude that the video was infringing. Third, | do not believe
that the willful blindness doctrine applies where, as here, a party has failed to consider fair use and affirmatively
misrepresents that a work is infringing.

| fully agree with the majority's conclusion that § 512(c)(3)(A)(v) requires copyright holders to consider whether potentially
infringing material is a fair use before issuing a takedown notice. As the majority opinion explains, a takedown notice must
contain “[a] statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of
is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.” 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A)(v). Because fair use of copyrighted
material is not an infringement of copyright, such use is “authorized by ... the law.” See id. § 107. Therefore, in order to form
“a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by ... the law,” id. § 512(c)(3)(A)(v),
a party must consider the doctrine of fair use.

Where | part ways with the majority is in the proper analysis of Universal's misrepresentation. The majority concludes that
“Universal faces liability if it knowingly misrepresented in the takedown notification that it had formed a good faith belief the
video was not authorized by the law, i.e., did not constitute fair use.” An unstated premise of this conclusion is that Universal
impliedly represented that it had considered fair use when it certified in its takedown notification that it held a good faith
belief that the video was not authorized by the law. Under the majority's approach, Universal's liability depends upon the
truth or falsity of its implied assertion that it held a good faith belief about whether the video was a fair use.

However, | do not construe § 512(f) to directly prohibit a party from falsely implying that it has considered fair use. Cf. Rossi
v. Motion Picture Ass'n of Am., Inc.. 391 F.3d 1000 , 1004-05 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that § 512(f) is “an expressly limited
cause of action”). Section 512(f) provides that “[a]Jny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section ...
that material or activity is infringing ... shall be liable for any damages.” (emphases added). The plain text of the statute
prohibits parties from misrepresenting that a work is infringing, not

[801 F.3d 1140]
from misrepresenting that they have considered fair use.

In my view, the relevant representation in this case is Universal's assertion that the video is infringing. Universal's liability
under § 512(f) depends initially on the disputed issue of whether the video is subject to the fair use doctrine. If the video is a
fair use, Universal's representation that the video is infringing was false.

This does not end the inquiry, of course, because § 512(f) only applies to “knowing[ ]” misrepresentations, not to innocent or
negligent misrepresentations. The majority approach does not squarely address § 512(f)'s “knowingly” requirement. In Rossi
v. Motion Picture Association of America Inc., we observed that “[a] copyright owner cannot be liable [under § 512(f) ] simply
because an unknowing mistake is made, even if the copyright owner acted unreasonably in making the mistake. Rather,
there must be a demonstration of some actual knowledge of misrepresentation on the part of the copyright owner.” 391 F.3d
at 1005 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Universal urges us to construe Rossi to mean that a party must subjectively
believe that the fact it asserts is false in order to be liable under § 512(f). If this is indeed the meaning of Rossi, it is difficult to
see how Lenz can possibly prevail. +

Section 512(f)'s “knowingly” requirement should not be construed this restrictively. Universal may be held liable for
knowingly misrepresenting that the video was infringing if, knowing it had not considered whether the video was a fair use, it
erroneously asserted that it was infringing. A party cannot truthfully represent that a work subject to the fair use doctrine is
infringing if the party has knowingly failed to consider whether the doctrine applies. Section 107 plainly states that “the fair
use of a copyrighted work ... is not an infringement of copyright.” The requirement that a party hold a “good faith” belief that
“the infringing material is not authorized by the law” would be rendered meaningless if parties could wholly omit to consider
whether the material was a fair use, and was therefore not an “infringing material” at all.

This reading of § 512(f) does not conflict with our decision in Rossi. A party that knowingly fails to consider fair use before

erroneously asserting that a work is infringing has “some actual knowledge of misrepresentation,” Rossi_391 F.3d at 1005 ,
because the party knows that, having failed to consider fair use, it lacks a basis to assert that the work is infringing.

This construction of “knowingly” is consistent with common law principles of deceit and fraudulent misrepresentation. Under
these principles, a misrepresentation is knowing if the party knows it is ignorant of the truth or falsity of its representation. For
example, in Cooper v. Schlesinger, 111 U.S. 148 , 155, 4 S.Ct. 360 , 28 L.Ed. 382 (1884) , the Supreme Court stated that “a
statement recklessly made, without knowledge of its truth, [is] a false statement knowingly made, within the settled rule.”
See also Sovereign Pocohontas Co. v. Bond, 120 F.2d 39 , 39-40 (D.C.Cir.1941) ; Knickerbocker Merch. Co. v. United
States, 13 F.2d 544 , 546 (2d Cir.1926) ;L J Mueller Furnace Co. v. Cascade Foundry

Co.,


--- Page 9 ---
145 F. 596, 600 (3d Cir.1906) ; Hindman v. First Nat'l Bank, 112 F. 931, 944 (6th Cir.1902).

Construing “knowingly” to include assertions made in conscious ignorance of their truth or falsity is also consistent with the
principles of the Second Restatement of Torts. The Second Restatement provides that “[a] misrepresentation is fraudulent if
the maker (a) knows or believes that the matter is not as he represents it to be, (b) does not have the confidence in the
accuracy of his representation that he states or implies, or (c) knows that he does not have the basis for his representation
that he states or implies.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 526 (emphasis added). 2 Under these principles, Universal faces
liability if it misrepresented that the video was infringing, knowing that it lacked a basis to conclude that the video was not a
fair use.

It is undisputed that Universal did not consider fair use before sending the takedown notice. Its policy was to send takedown
notices if “the composition was the focus of the video,” that is, where “[t]he music [was] prominently featured in the video.” |
disagree with the majority's conclusion that there is a factual dispute regarding whether applying this policy in this case could
have been “sufficient to form a subjective good faith belief about the video's fair use or lack thereof.” Section 107 explicitly
enumerates the factors to be considered in assessing whether a work is a fair use. 17 U.S.C. § 107. Universal's policy of
determining whether “the composition was the focus of the video” simply did not permit it to form an opinion about how the
fair use factors applied to the video. 3 Moreover, Universal knewit lacked a basis to conclude that the work was infringing,
because it knew that if this video was a fair use, it was not infringing. Section 107 states as much explicitly. /d.

The sole disputed issue in this case was whether Universal's representation that the video was infringing was false—that is,
whether the video was a fair use. Universal knew that a fair use was not infringing, knew that it had not considered fair use,
and nonetheless asserted that the video was infringing. Universal may be held to

[801 F.3d 1142]
account if the video was not infringing, because it knew it lacked a basis to assert that it was.

| also have doubts about whether the willful blindness doctrine is relevant to analyzing whether a misrepresentation is
“knowing ]” under § 512(f). The doctrine was originally applied to “criminal statutes requir[ing] proof that a defendant acted
knowingly or willfully.” See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A.,563 U.S. 754 , 131 S.Ct. 2060 2068. 179 L.Ed.2d
1167 (2011) . Courts reasoned that defendants could not avoid criminal liability under such statutes “by deliberately
shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts that are strongly suggested by the circumstances.” /d. at 2068-69.
Federal courts have applied the doctrine to non-criminal statutes that include a requirement that a party have acted
knowingly or willfully, including intellectual property statutes. See id. at 2068-71 (active inducement of patent infringement
under 35 U.S.C. § 271(b) ); Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., 676 F.3d 19 , 34-35 (2d Cir.2012) (“actual knowledge” under
17 U.S.C. § 512(c)'s safe harbor provision); In re Aimster Copyright Litig., 334 F.3d 643 , 650-51 (7th Cir.2003) (contributory
infringement of copyright); Dolman v. Agee. 157 F.3d 708 , 714-15 (9th Cir.1998) (“willful’ copyright infringement under 17
U.S.C. § 504(c)(2) ). It does not necessarily follow, however, that we should apply the doctrine to construe § 512(f). Section
512(f) creates a statutory misrepresentation action, and it is likely Congress intended the action to mirror analogous
common law torts like fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation. Therefore, we should examine common law tort principles to
construe “knowingly,” rather than import a doctrine that developed from the criminal law. As | explain above, common law
principles of misrepresentation establish that a misrepresentation is knowing if the party knows it is ignorant of the truth or
falsity of its representation.

Because the common law of torts already provides ample insight into what Congress meant by “knowingly,” there is no need
to also apply the more stringent, and confusing, willful blindness test. To demonstrate willful blindness a plaintiff must
establish two factors: “(1) the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and (2) the
defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.” Global-Tech, 131 S.Ct. at 2070 . It makes little sense
in this case to ask whether Universal subjectively believed that there was a high probability the video was a fair use. The
evidence was that Universal knowingly failed to form any belief about whether the video was fair use. This suffices to satisfy
§ 512(f)'s requirement that the misrepresentation be “knowing[ ].”

In sum, | would hold that parties must individually consider whether a work is a fair use before representing that the work is
infringing in a takedown notice. If they do not, and the work is a non-infringing fair use, they are subject to liability for
knowingly misrepresenting that the work is infringing.

For the foregoing reasons, | respectfully dissent in part.
Notes:

1YouTube is a for-profit company that generates revenues by selling advertising. If users choose to become “content partners” with YouTube, they share
in a portion of the advertising revenue generated. Lenz is not a content partner and no advertisements appear next to the video.

2""[T]he parties do not dispute that Lenz used copyrighted material in her video or that Universal is the true owner of Prince's copyrighted music.” Lenz v.
Universal Music Corp., 572 F.Supp.2d 1150 , 1153-54 (N.D.Cal.2008).

3Title | of the DMCA specifies recovery for “actual damages.” 17 U.S.C. § 1203(c)(1)(A). If Congress intended to similarly limit the recovery of § 512(f)
damages to pecuniary losses, it could have chosen to do so.


--- Page 10 ---
4Lenz may not recover nominal damages for “impairment of free speech rights.” No authority supports the recovery of nominal damages caused by a
private actor's chilling of free speech rights. All of the cases Lenz cites address challenges to governmental action.

1The majority opinion implies that Universal would be liable if its actions were not sufficient to form a good faith belief about fair use, and that this is a
disputed issue for the jury. But if Universal's proposed construction of Rossi is correct, Universal would not be liable merely because its actions were not
sufficient to form a good faith belief about fair use. Instead, it would only be liable if it knew its actions were not sufficient. Otherwise, Universal would not
have “knowingly” misrepresented that it had formed a good faith belief about fair use.

2The Second Restatement refers to “fraudulent misrepresentation,” rather than “knowing” misrepresentation. See However, as the Restatement clarifies,
the requirement that a misrepresentation be “fraudulent” “solely” refers to the party's knowledge of misrepresentation. Compare id. cmt. a. (“The word
‘fraudulent’ is here used as referring solely to the maker's knowledge of the untrue character of his representation. This element of the defendant's
conduct frequently is called ‘scienter’ by the courts.”), with Rossi,_391 F.3d at 1005 (“[T]here must be a demonstration of some actual knowledge of
misrepresentation on the part of the copyright owner.”). It is therefore instructive to examine the Restatement definition of “fraudulent” in construing the
meaning of “knowingly.”

3The majority opinion implies that a copyright holder could form a good faith belief that a work was not a fair use by utilizing computer programs that
automatically identify possible infringing content. | agree that such programs may be useful in identifying infringing content. However, the record does not
disclose whether these programs are currently capable of analyzing fair use. Section 107 specifically enumerates the factors to be considered in
analyzing fair use. These include: “the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes”; “the nature of the copyrighted work”; “the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a
whole”; and “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.” 17 U.S.C. § 107. For a copyright holder to rely solely on
a computer algorithm to form a good faith belief that a work is infringing, that algorithm must be capable of applying the factors enumerated in § 107.

Hustler Magazine, Inc. published a parody featuring Reverend Jerry Falwell. Moral Majority, Inc. and Old Time Gospel
Hour mailed hundreds of thousands of copies of the parody as part of a solicitation drive. Falwell also solicited contributions
while displaying the parody on the Old Time Gospel Hour, a television show. Hustler Magazine, Inc. sued Moral Majority,

judgment motion, holding that their copying constituted ""fair use,"" 606 F.Supp. 1526 . Hustler appeals and both sides
request costs and attorney fees. We affirm.

BACKGROUND

In the November 1983 and March 1984 issues of Hustler Magazine, appellant Hustler Magazine, Inc. (""Hustler"")
published a parody of Campari liquor advertisements. Campari advertisements consist of interviews with famous people
about the first time they drank Campari. The advertisements use double entendres to give the reader the impression that the
""first time""

Page 1150
refers to the celebrity's first sexual experience.

The Hustler Magazine parody featured Reverend Jerry Falwell, a nationally known fundamentalist minister, describing
his ""first time"" as being incest with his mother in an outhouse, and saying that he always gets ""sloshed"" before giving his
sermons. At the bottom of the page in small print is the disclaimer ""AD PARODY--NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.""

On November 15, 1983, Moral Majority, Inc., a conservative political lobbying group, sent out two mailings signed by
Falwell. One was directed to approximately 500,000 ""rank-and-file"" members. It described the parody without including a
copy of the actual parody, and asked for a contribution to help Falwell ""defend his mother's memory"" in court. ' This first
mailing is not involved in the suit. The second mailing was directed to about 26,900 ""major donors"" and included a copy of
the parody with eight of the most offensive words blackened out. It also requested donations to help finance Falwell's suit
against Hustler.

Three days later, Old Time Gospel Hour, a corporate sponsor of religious television and radio broadcasts, mailed a
solicitation including a copy of the parody to approximately 750,000 supporters of its programs. This letter was also signed
by Falwell, but focused on the need to keep Falwell's religious television stations open in order to combat people like Larry
Flynt, Hustler's publisher. Within 30 days of the mailings, the Moral Majority received approximately $45,000 from the ""major
donors"" letter and the Old Time Gospel Hour received approximately $672,000 from its letter. A Moral Majority executive
admitted that the intent behind including copies of the parody was to raise money.

Finally, on December 4, 1983 and December 11, 1983, Falwell displayed the parody during nation-wide television


--- Page 2 ---
broadcasts of his weekly sermon on the Old Time Gospel Hour. The amount of contributions generated from this broadcast
is not in the record.

On August 8, 1984, Hustler sued Moral Majority, Inc., Jerry Falwell, and the Old Time Gospel Hour (the ""Defendants"")
for infringing its copyright. In March 1985, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The Defendants raised the
defense of fair use. ? The district court held that Hustler had made out a prima facie case of infringement, but granted
summary judgment for the Defendants. The court held that the mailings and television displays were permissible under the
fair use doctrine.

Hustler timely appealed and this court has jurisdiction.

""The task of this court is identical to that of the trial court when reviewing a grant of summary judgment."" Continental
Casualty Co. v. City of Richmond, 763 F.2d 1076 , 1078 (9th Cir.1985). Accordingly, we determine de novo whether, viewing
the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment has been granted, the moving party
has demonstrated that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. at

DISCUSSION
|. Fair Use

""[T]here are only two elements necessary to the plaintiff's case in an infringement action: ownership of the copyright by
the plaintiff and copying by the defendant."" 3 M. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 13.01 (1985). In the instant case, there
is no dispute that Hustler is the registered owner of the copyrighted parody. Hustler, as the copyright owner, has the
exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and publicly display copies of the work. See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 106. Falwell copied the
parody without Hustler's permission. Thus, the district court properly found that Hustler made out a prima facie case of
infringement. See Walker v. University Books, Inc., 602 F.2d 859 , 862 (9th Cir.1979).

Hustler's exclusive rights, however, are subject to statutory exceptions, including the exception for ""fair use."" See 17
U.S.C. Secs. 106, 107. Accordingly, Defendants seek to avoid liability by establishing the defense of ""fair use."" The fair use
doctrine confers a privilege on people other than the copyright owner ""to use the copyrighted material in a reasonable
manner without his consent, notwithstanding the monopoly granted to the owner."" Marcus v. Rowley, 695 F.2d 1171 , 1174
(9th Cir.1983) (quoting Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 366 F.2d 303 , 306 (2d Cir.1966), cert. denied,
385 U.S. 1009 , 87 S.Ct. 714 , 17 L.Ed.2d 546 (1967) ). The doctrine is a means of balancing the need to provide individuals
with sufficient incentives to create public works with the public's interest in the dissemination of information. See Pacific and
Southern Co., 744 F.2d at 1495 . Congress incorporated this common law doctrine into section 107 of the Copyright Act of
1976, 17 U.S.C. Secs. 101-810.

Section 107 reads in pertinent part: ""Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the fair use of a copyrighted work ...
for purposes such as criticism, comment, [or] news reporting, ... is not an infringement of copyright."" 17 U.S.C. Sec. 107.

In addition, section 107 specifies four factors this court must consider in determining whether the use in a particular
case is a fair use:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
17 U.S.C. Sec. 107. 4 Courts balance these factors to determine whether the public
Page 1152

interest in the free flow of information outweighs the copyright holder's interest in exclusive control over the work. See DC
Comics, Inc. v. Reel Fantasy, Inc., 696 F.2d 24 , 27 (2d Cir.1982).



--- Page 3 ---
A. The Purpose and Character of the Defendants' Uses

The first factor listed in section 107 requires us to consider the character of the use and to weigh the commercial or
nonprofit purpose of the use. If the work is used for a commercial or profit-making purpose, the use is presumptively unfair.
See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 449-451, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 792-793, 78 L.Ed.2d 574
(1984) . ""The crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether
the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price."" Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 2231-32, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) ; see also lowa State
University Research Foundation, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 621 F.2d 57 , 61 (2d Cir.1980) (""The fair
use doctrine is not a license for corporate theft, empowering a court to ignore a copyright whenever it determines the
underlying work contains material of possible public importance."").

The parties disagree about the purpose and character of the use. Falwell contends that he sent the parody to his
followers to give them information to rebut the statements it contained, and that the appeal for money was ancillary. Hustler
contends, however, that the advertisement was clearly a parody so there was nothing to rebut and thus the letters were
purely fundraisers.

There is ample evidence that the defendants distributed copies of the parody as an integral part of a financial appeal.
All of the letters and television displays involved outright appeals for donations to the Moral Majority to support Falwell's
lawsuit against Hustler 5 or to the Old Time Gospel Hour to support his radio and television network. &

Moreover, the chief executive officers of Moral Majority and Old Time Gospel Hour admitted that the parody was copied
and sent as part of a ""market approach"" to fundraising. Falwell's displaying of the parodies on his television show was also
motivated by financial purposes. In addition, the Defendants raised almost one million dollars and therefore clearly profited
from their use of the parody without paying any price. Because the Defendants used the parody for a profit-making purpose,
their use is presumptively unfair.

Even assuming that the use had a purely commercial purpose, the presumption of unfairness can be rebutted by the
characteristics of the use. See Triangle

Page 1153

Publications, Inc. v. Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Inc., 626 F.2d 1171 , 1177 (5th Cir.1980) (comparative advertising);
Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. General Signal Corp., 724 F.2d 1044 , 1049 (2d Cir.1983) (advertising
information), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 105 S.Ct. 100 , 83 L.Ed.2d 45 (1984) . When the use has both commercial and non-
profit characteristics, the court may consider ""whether the alleged infringing use was primarily for public benefit or for private
commercial gain."" MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 677 F.2d 180 , 182 (2d Cir.1981); see also Meeropol v. Nizer, 560 F.2d 1061 , 1069
(2d Cir.1977) (""[I]t is relevant whether or not the Rosenberg letters were used primarily for scholarly, historical reasons, or
predominantly for commercial exploitation.""), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1013 , 98 S.Ct. 727 , 54 L.Ed.2d 756 (1978) .

In the instant case, Defendants concede that their use was in part to raise money. They contend, however, that they
also used the copies to rebut the personal attack upon Falwell and make a political comment about pornography. There was
no attempt to palm off the parody as that of the Defendants. In fact, the very opposite is true. Falwell was not selling the
parody, but was instead using the parody to make a statement about pornography and Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler. 7

Section 107 expressly permits fair use for the purposes of criticism and comment. 17 U.S.C. Sec. 107. Hustler
contends, however, that Falwell copied more than was necessary for his response. Hustler points to the fact that Falwell
mailed a similar letter of criticism to Moral Majority ""rank and file"" members without enclosing a copy of the parody. However,
an individual in rebutting a copyrighted work containing derogatory information about himself may copy such parts of the
work as are necessary to permit understandable comment. § Falwell did not use more than was reasonably necessary to
make an understandable comment when he copied the entire parody from the magazine. 9 Therefore, the public interest in
allowing an individual to defend himself against such derogatory personal attacks serves to rebut the presumption of
unfairness.

B. The Nature of the Copyrighted Work.
The scope of fair use is greater when ""informational"" as opposed to more ""creative""
Page 1154

works are involved. Marcus v. Rowley, 695 F.2d 1171, 1176 (9th Cir.1983); see also Harper & Row, 105 S.Ct. at 2232 (""The
law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy.""); Sony Corp., 464 U.
S. Reports 455 n. 40, 104 S.Ct. at 794 n. 40 (""Copying a news broadcast may have a stronger claim to fair use than
copying a motion picture.""); 3 Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 13.05[A]. Thus, we consider whether the work is imaginative and
original, or whether it represented a substantial investment of time and labor made in anticipation of a financial return. MCA,
677 F.2d at 182 .

There is no dispute that the parody was more creative than informational. The district court discounted the significance
of the work's creative nature, however, because the defendants did not use the parody for its creative value.

There is nothing in the statute, case law, or legislative history to support the district court's approach. In fact, by


--- Page 4 ---
copying all or substantially all of the copyrighted work, ""the distinction of function vanishes since whatever the intent of the
copier, a verbatim reproduction will of necessity serve the function of the plaintiff's work as well as that of the defendant's."" 3
Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 13.05[D](1). Accordingly, the creative nature of the parody means that the scope of fair use in this
case is less than the scope of fair use for informational works.

C. The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

In the instant case, the Defendants copied the entire parody, covering up only eight of the most offensive words.
Defendants argue that they did not copy an entire work, but only one page from a 154-page magazine. '° Although each
component of a composite work is capable of individual copyright protection and need not bear a separate copyright notice,
17 U.S.C. Sec. 404, Lin-Brook Builders Hardware v. Gertler, 352 F.2d 298 , 301 n. 5 (9th Cir.1965), courts have not always
evaluated a component of a copyrighted composite work as an ""entire work."" Rather courts consider the relationship of the
copied component to the composite work to determine whether to analyze the work as an ""entire work.""

The Fifth Circuit is one of two circuits to have expressly discussed this issue. 1! In Triangle Publications, 626 F.2d 1171
, the court held that Knight-Ridder had not copied an entire work by reproducing the cover of TV Guide Magazine for
comparative advertising purposes. Id. at 1177 & n. 15. The court noted that Knight-Ridder did not copy the essence of the
magazine--the television schedules and articles. Id.

The Eleventh Circuit evaluated this issue in a slightly different context. In Pacific and Southern Co., 744 F.2d 1490 , a
company videotaped a television station's news broadcasts and sold copies of the relevant portions. The television station
sued the company for selling a tape of a story from one of its broadcasts. The court held that the feature, as a coherent
narrative, stands alone as a copyrighted work. Id. at 1497. Therefore, the company had copied an entire work. The court
distinguished the case from Triangle Publications because the program segment was copyrighted separately and was stored
separately from the rest of the broadcast. Id. at 1497 n. 10.

Thus to determine whether the parody should be treated as an ""entire work,"" we consider the relationship of the copied
parody to the periodical as a whole. Unlike

Page 1155

the cover of TV Guide in Triangle Publications, the inside pages of a magazine are not on public display. Moreover, the
parody in this case, like the story in Pacific and Southern Co., represents the ""essence"" of Hustler Magazine. In addition, like
the story in Pacific and Southern Co. and unlike the magazine cover in Triangle Publications, the parody is not an
interwoven component of the magazine, but can stand totally alone. A creative work does not deserve less copyright
protection just because it is part of a composite work. Therefore, in this case, we view the Defendants as having copied an
entire work.

Hustler argues that ""this court has long maintained the view that wholesale copying of copyrighted material precludes
application of the fair use doctrine."" Marcus, 695 F.2d at 1176 . See also Benny v. Loew's, Inc., 239 F.2d 532 , 536 (9th
Cir.1956), aff'd by an equally divided court sub nom. Columbia Broadcasting System v. Loew's, 356 U.S. 43 , 78 S.Ct. 667 ,
2 L.Ed.2d 583 (1958) ; Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, 581 F.2d 751 , 758 (9th Cir.1978), cert. denied,439 U.S.
1132 ,99 S.Ct. 1054 , 59 L.Ed.2d 94 (1979) .

The Supreme Court's opinion in Sony Corp., 464 U.S. 417 , 104 S.Ct. 774 , however, casts doubt on our previous
pronouncements concerning wholesale copying as an absolute preclusion to fair use. In Sony Corp., the Supreme Court
held that ""time-shifting"" television programs by taping whole programs with a video tape recorder did not have its ""ordinary
effect of militating against a finding of fair use."" Id. at 450, 104 S.Ct. at 793 .

Sony Corp. teaches us that the copying of an entire work does not preclude fair use per se. However, ""a subsequent
user does not require such complete copying if he is truly pursuing a different functional mileau."" 3 Nimmer on Copyright
Sec. 13.05[D]. Consequently, although wholesale copying does not preclude fair use per se, the amount of copying that the
Defendants did in this case still militates against a finding of fair use.

D. Effect Upon Potential Market or Value

Finally, we must consider ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" 17
U.S.C. Sec. 107(4). ""This last factor is undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use."" Harper & Row, 105 S.Ct.
at 2234 . See also 3 Nimmer Sec. 13.05[A] at 13-76. ""The purpose of copyright is to create incentives for creative effort.""
Sony Corp., 464 U. S. Reports 450, 104 S.Ct. at 793 . ""[A] use that has no demonstrable effect upon the market for, or the
value of, the copyrighted work need not be prohibited in order to protect the author's incentive to create."" Id. Therefore, ""[flair
use, when properly applied, is limited to copying by others which does not materially impair the marketability of the work
which is copied."" Harper & Row, 105 S.Ct. at 2234 (quoting 1 Nimmer Sec. 1.10[D] at 1-87).

In the instant case, the parties disagree over whether the Defendants copied the parody for commercial or
noncommercial uses. Every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation of a copyright
owner's monopoly; accordingly, the likelihood of future harm may be presumed. Sony Corp., 464 U. S. Reports 451, 104
S.Ct. at 793 . Whereas, when the use is noncommercial, the copyright owner must demonstrate by a preponderance of the
evidence that there is ""some meaningful likelihood of future harm."" Id. (emphasis in the original). The owner, however, need
only show that, should the challenged use become widespread, it would adversely affect the potential market for the work.



--- Page 5 ---
Id.; Harper & Row, 105 S.Ct. at 2234-35 .

In determining whether the use has harmed the work's value or market, courts have focused on whether the infringing
use: (1) ""tends to diminish or prejudice the potential sale of [the] work,"" Meeropol v. Nizer, 560 F.2d at 1070 ; or (2) tends to
interfere with the marketability of the work, Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 482 F.Supp. 741 , 747

Page 1156

(S.D.N.Y.),affd, 623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir.1980) ; or (3) fulfills the demand for the original work, Wainwright Securities Inc. v.
Wall Street Transcript Corp., 558 F.2d 91 , 96 (2d Cir.1977), cert. denied,434 U.S. 1014 , 98 S.Ct. 730 , 54 L.Ed.2d 759
(1978) ; Berlin v. E.C. Publications, Inc., 329 F.2d 541 , 545 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 822 , 85 S.Ct. 46 , 13 L.Ed.2d
33 (1964) .

The parody was first published September 27 and was off the newsstands before the defendants' first mailings in
November. Thus, the republication did not diminish the initial sales. We agree with the district court that the effect on the
marketability of back issues of the entire magazine is de minimis because it is only one page of a publication which would be
purchased for ""its other attractions.""

Nor have the Defendants’ mailings effected any potential market, even though the parody could be licensed
independently of the magazine. '? Although the Defendants used the parody for a commercial purpose in the sense that they
profited from copying it, they did not actually sell the copies to willing buyers. Instead the Defendants used the copies to
generate moral outrage against their ""enemies"" and thus stimulate monetary support for their political cause. Moreover, as
the district court noted, Moral Majority or Old Time Gospel Hour members would probably not be counted among Hustler's
readers. Therefore, Hustler's creative incentives are not decreased because the Defendants are profiting from an activity
that Hustler could not have taken advantage of. See Pacific and Southern Co., 744 F.2d at 1496 . ""Where the copy does not
compete in any way with the original ... concern [about copiers undercutting demand and discouraging creativity] is absent.""
Consumers Union, 724 F.2d at 1051 .

The Defendants’ use could not have diminished any potential sales, interfered with the marketability of the parody or
fulfilled the demand for the original work. Therefore, even viewing the Defendants’ copying as a commercial use, Defendants
have rebutted any presumption of unfair exploitation of Hustler's copyright monopoly.

E. Conclusion

The fair use doctrine is an equitable rule of reason. See House Report, supra at 73, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News
1976, p. 5686. Weighing all four factors, we find that even after resolving all factual issues in favor of Hustler, the district
court did not err in determining that the Defendants’ use constituted fair use and granting summary judgment.

ll. Attorneys' Fees
A. For Defendants

The Defendants contend that Hustler's appeal is frivolous and request costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to 17 U.S.C.
Sec. 505, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1912 and Fed.R.App.P. 38. Section 505 of Title 17 provides that courts may award reasonable
costs and attorneys' fees to the prevailing party in an infringement action. 17 U.S.C. Sec. 505 (emphasis added). Thus, this
court may make an award for services rendered on appeal. See Russell v. Price. 612 F.2d 1123 , 1132 (9th Cir.1979), cert.
denied, 446 U.S. 952 , 100 S.Ct. 2919 , 64 L.Ed.2d 809 (1980) . An award of attorneys' fees to the defendant represents ""a
penalty for the institution of a frivolous or bad faith suit."" Jartech, Inc. v. Clancy, 666 F.2d 403 , 407 (9th Cir.), cert. denied,
459 U.S. 879 , 103 S.Ct. 175 , 74 L.Ed.2d 143 (1982) . An appeal is frivolous if the result is obvious or the arguments
presented are wholly without merit. NLRB v. Catalina Yachts, 679 F.2d 180 , 182 (9th Cir.1982).

Hustler's arguments, however, are not ""ludicrous"" as the Defendants find them, nor is there evidence to support their
contention that Hustler brought the appeal merely as a means of further harassment.

Page 1157
In fact, there is some merit to Hustler's appeal. Accordingly, we deny the Defendants’ request for attorneys’ fees and costs.
B. For Hustler

Hustler also seeks an award of costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to 17 U.S.C. Sec. 505. ""Section 505 is intended in
part to encourage the assertion of colorable copyright claims and to deter infringement."" Diamond v. Am-Law Publishing
Corp., 745 F.2d 142 , 148 (2d Cir.1984). Defendants, however, should not be penalized for defending an appeal. Therefore,
we deny Hustler's request for attorneys' fees on appeal.

AFFIRMED.
POOLE, dissenting:

The majority concedes that Moral Majority, Inc., Old Time Gospel Hour, and Jerry Falwell distributed or displayed
Hustler Magazine's copyrighted ad parody in an effort to raise money for themselves. Despite this commercial purpose, the


--- Page 6 ---
majority concludes that their copying constituted ""fair use."" | disagree.

Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976 specifies four factors this court must consider in analyzing the merits of a fair
use defense:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. Sec. 107. The proposed opinion analyzes these factors and concludes that the first and fourth factors
support a finding of fair use while the second and third factors militate against such a finding. The opinion then summarily
concludes ""[w]eighing all four factors, we find that even after resolving all factual issues in favor of Hustler, the district court
did not err in determining that the Defendants' use constituted fair use and granting summary judgment."" Opinion at 1156.
Since the key to this conclusion lies with factors one and four, | will focus on the majority's analysis of those two factors.

A. The First Factor: the Purpose and Character of the Defendants’ Use

The opinion acknowledges that the parody was distributed by the defendants as an integral part of a financial appeal.
Thus, the use is presumptively unfair. See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 449, 104
S.Ct. 774 , 793, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) . The defendants attempt to rebut this presumption by claiming that their primary
reason for sending the copies was to refute the personal attack upon Falwell and to make a political comment about
pornography.

Assuming that the defendants were also motivated by such purposes, their actions in publishing the entire parody went
beyond the limited boundaries of the fair use defense. As conceded by the majority, the defendants could copy only so
much of the work as was necessary to permit understandable comment. There is no reason why Falwell needed to copy the
entire parody to rebut the personal attack or to comment on what the ""pornographers"" were publishing. A summary of the
parody, such as that contained in the factual summary of the majority opinion, would have sufficed. Quite clearly, the only
reason for copying the entire parody would be to increase the chances that the parody would arouse such moral indignation
that the members would be more likely to send in financial contributions to help support Falwell's lawsuit against Hustler or
to support his radio and television network. Accordingly, the majority's conclusion that Falwell did not copy more of the
parody than was reasonably necessary to make an understandable comment confuses Falwell's true purpose in copying the
entire work.

Moreover, | disagree with the legal conclusion by the majority that ""the public interest in allowing an individual to defend
Page 1158

himself against * * * derogatory personal attacks serves to rebut the presumption of unfairness."" Opinion at 1153. Such a
sweeping generalization finds no support in either the case law or the purposes underlying the fair use defense. On the
contrary, it is clear that the public's interest in reading an author's work is not alone sufficient to override the protections
granted under the federal copyright laws. In Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539 , 105 S.Ct.
2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) , the Court held that a magazine's act of publishing verbatim excerpts from the unpublished
memoirs of former President Gerald R. Ford did not constitute fair use. The Court rejected the magazine's contention that
the newsworthiness of the contents of the manuscript independently justified its unauthorized copying of the expression
prior to publication by the copyright holder. Id. 105 S.Ct. at 2229 ; see lowa State University Research Foundation, Inc. v.
American Broadcasting Cos., Inc., 621 F.2d 57 , 61 (2d Cir.1980) (""The fair use doctrine is not a license for corporate theft,
empowering a court to ignore a copyright whenever it determines the underlying work contains material of possible public
importance.""). It is not a license for assertedly religious or ""moral"" theft, either. Accordingly, Falwell's alleged purpose of
defending himself against the personal attack made by Hustler in its ad parody, if that were indeed his purpose, might
certainly constitute some factor in the fair use analysis, but it does not excuse the infringement of Hustler's copyright.
Falwell's claim, however, is belied by the manifestly financial gain which he hastened to secure.

As previously noted, Falwell went beyond simply criticizing and commenting on the ad parody and actively sought to
exploit the emotional impact of the work to raise money. This commercial use of the copyrighted work is a separate factor
that weighs against a finding of fair use. The fact that Falwell also had other motives in publishing the parody does not
prevent the operation of this factor for ""[t]he crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is
monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the
customary price."" Harper & Row, 105 S.Ct. at 2231-32 . The defendants published Hustler's parody in the hope of milking
the possible indignation it would arouse for their own personal monetary benefit. This purpose weighs strongly against a
conclusion that the defendants’ use of the parody was a fair use.

B. The Fourth Factor: Effect Upon Potential Market or Value

The majority also incorrectly analyzes the fourth factor listed in section 107--the effect upon plaintiff's potential market.
This factor is concerned with whether if the challenged use ""should become widespread, it would adversely affect the


--- Page 7 ---
potential market for the copyrighted work."" Sony Corp., 464 U. S. Reports 451, 104 S.Ct. at 793 .

If Falwell's actions were to become widespread such that individuals were sending out copies of the ad parody to the
public in order to solicit money to support campaigns against ""the pornographers"" such as Larry Flynt, then quite clearly the
future potential market for the parody would be diminished. ' This is because the act of

Page 1159

distributing copies of the entire copyrighted work to the public would fulfill the demand of the original. See Wainwright

(1975)).

Under what | believe to be the only sensible analysis, all four factors weigh against a finding of fair use. Consequently, |
would reverse the district court's decision and remand the case with directions that it enter summary judgment in favor of
Hustler.

* The Honorable Gus J. Solomon, Senior District Judge, District of Oregon, sitting by designation.

1 In an action separate from the instant case, Falwell sued Hustler, Inc., its publisher Larry Flynt, and Flynt Distributing Company in state court in Virginia
for libel, invasion of privacy, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. The jury held for Falwell only on the emotional distress claim. Hustler is
appealing the verdict.

2 The Defendants apparently also raised the equitable defense of unclean hands at the summary judgment hearing and argued that Hustler did not own a
valid or enforceable copyright in the parody. The district court did not reach this question, and the Defendants do not raise it on appeal.

3 But see DC Comics, Inc. v. Reel Fantasy, Inc., 696 F.2d 24 , 28 (2d Cir.1982) (fair use is normally a question of fact); MCA. Inc. v. Wilson, 677 F.2d
180 , 183 (2d Cir.1981); Triangle Publications, Inc. v. Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Inc., 626 F.2d 1171 , 1175 (5th Cir.1980); Eisenschiml v. Fawcett
Publications, Inc., 246 F.2d 598 , 604 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 907 , 78 S.Ct. 334 , 2 L.Ed.2d 262 (1957) ; 3 M. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright
Sec. 13.05 at 13-63 (1985).

4 The legislative history is clear, however, that these factors are not exclusive. The Report of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House states:

Although the courts have considered and ruled upon the fair use doctrine over and over again, no real definition of the concept has ever emerged.
Indeed, since the doctrine is an equitable rule of reason, no generally applicable definition is possible, and each case raising the question must be
decided on its own facts.... Beyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of the criteria applicable to it, the courts must be free
to adapt the doctrine to particular situations on a case-by-case basis.

H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, 94th Cong., 2nd Sess. 65-66 reprinted in 1976 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 5659, 5679-80 [hereinafter cited as ""House Report"").
5 For example, the November 15, 1983 appeal to Moral Majority “major donors"" reads in part:

As you know, legal matters are time consuming and expensive. There are lawyer's fees and court costs to consider, not to mention the personal time and
energy | must devote in these next trying weeks and months.

Will you help me defend my family and myself against the smears and slander of this major pornographic magazine--will you send a gift of $500 so that
we may take up this important legal-battle?

6 Old Time Gospel Hour letter dated November 18, 1983 reads in part:

| was ready to cut another 50-100 stations--when someone showed me a full-page liquor advertisement which appeared in the November issue of
Hustler Magazine--a pornographic tabloid.

When | saw it--| decided that, in a society containing people like Larry Flynt, the Old Time Gospel Hour must remain on the air--on every station.

lam not a quitter. That is why | have established the Old Time Gospel Hour SURVIVAL FUND.
[P]lease help me with this SURVIVAL FUND. Your gift of $150 can make a great difference.
7 The November 15, 1983 appeal to Moral Majority ""major donors"" reads in part:

Sane and moral Americans all across our nation are outraged by how much these pornographers are getting away with these days. And pornography is
no longer a thing restricted to back-alley bookshops and sordid movie houses.

Now pornography has thrust its ugly head into our everyday lives and is multiplying like a filthy plague. Flynt's magazine, for example, advertises
pornographic telephone services where, for a fee, men or women will engage in an obscene phone call with you!

Cable pornography with its ""X"" rated and triple ""X"" rated films can bleed over into a regular cable system right into your own living room.

And there, in my opinion, is clear proof that the billion dollar sex industry, of which Larry Flynt is a self-declared leader, is preying on innocent,


--- Page 8 ---
impressionable children to feed the lusts of depraved adults.
For those porno peddlers, it appears that lust and greed have replaced decency and morality.
8 The legislative history to section 107 states:

When a copyrighted work contains unfair, inaccurate, or derogatory information concerning an individual or institution, the individual or institution may
copy and reproduce such parts of the work as are necessary to permit understandable comment on the statements made in the work.

House Report, supra at 73, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, p. 5687.

9 Hustler contends that even if Falwell had a right to copy the parody of himself to rebut its content, Moral Majority and Old Time Gospel do not have the
same right. However, all the letters went out under Falwell's name and on Falwell's stationary. Clearly Falwell, as president and founder of both entities,
used them as a medium to transmit his messages. For the same reason, Falwell fails in his contention that he should be dismissed from the case
because he did not personally receive any money. The letters asked for money for his legal costs and to save his television stations.

10 The district court also held that even if the parody was an ""entire work"" it would not give weight to copying the whole because it consisted of only
approximately 300 words. There are no cases supporting this view. In fact, even though Harper & Row involved a taking of about 300 words, the
Supreme Court refused to find fair use. 105 S.Ct. at 2233-34 .

11 Without discussing this issue, the Second Circuit compared the amount taken from an article in Consumer Reports to the length of the article, not the
whole magazine. Consumers Union, 724 F.2d at 1050 .

12 The fact that Hustler does not actively market the parody for other purposes is irrelevant because Section 107 looks to the ""potential market"" in
analyzing the effects of the alleged infringement. See Pacific and Southern Co., 744 F.2d at 1496 .

1 | have problems with the district court's conclusion, accepted by the majority opinion, that Moral Majority or Old Time Gospel Hour members would
probably not be counted among Hustler's readers. If such a showing was made or Hustler stipulated to this fact, then such a conclusion can be accepted.
Otherwise, | do not think a court can take judicial notice of such a matter. Furthermore, Hustler's future licensing rights with regard to the parody may be
impaired nonetheless since these Moral Majority or Old Time Gospel Hour members may count themselves readers of a different publication which could
contain this parody, e.g., a compilation of parodies of public figures which contains this parody, albeit probably a toned down version. Or the members, if
they had not already seen the entire parody, may have become curious enough about its contents as to break down and purchase the back copy of
Hustler magazine or a future copy wherein the magazine had republished the parody. Or, perhaps the fact that the parody was included in that back
copy might tempt some persons to use that fact as a justification for looking into the other contents of the magazine--in order to comprehend how
shocking was the setting in which the parody appeared.

Syndicate, Inc. as amicus curiae.

Before: CARDAMONE, PIERCE and WALKER, Circuit Judges.
CARDAMONE, Circuit Judge:

The key to this copyright infringement suit, brought by a plaintiff photographer against a defendant sculptor and the
gallery representing him, is defendants’ borrowing of plaintiff's expression of a typical American scene--a smiling husband
and wife holding a litter of charming puppies. The copying was so deliberate as to suggest that defendants resolved so long
as they were significant players in the art business, and the copies they produced bettered the price of the copied work by a
thousand to one, their piracy of a less well-known artist's work would escape being sullied by an accusation of plagiarism.

BACKGROUND FACTS
A. Rogers

We think it helpful to understanding this appeal to set forth the principals’ professional backgrounds. Plaintiff, Art
Rogers, a 43-year-old professional artist-photographer, has a studio and home at Point Reyes, California, where he makes
his living by creating, exhibiting, publishing and otherwise making use of his rights in his photographic works. Exhibitions of
his photographs have been held in California and as far away as Maine, Florida and New York. His work has been described
in French (""Le Monde""), British (""The Photo"") and numerous American publications, including the Journal of American
Photography, Polaroid's Close-Up Magazine and the Popular Photography Annual. Rogers' photographs are part of the
permanent collection of the San Francisco Museum of

Page 304

Modern Art, the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona and Joseph E. Seagrams and Sons in New
York City. He has taught photography at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

B. Creating The Photograph ""Puppies""

In 1980 an acquaintance, Jim Scanlon, commissioned Rogers to photograph his eight new German Shepherd puppies.
When Rogers went to his home on September 21, 1980 he decided that taking a picture of the puppies alone would not work
successfully, and chose instead to include Scanlon and his wife holding them. Substantial creative effort went into both the
composition and production of ""Puppies,"" a black and white photograph. At the photo session, and later in his lab, Rogers
drew on his years of artistic development. He selected the light, the location, the bench on which the Scanlons are seated
and the arrangement of the small dogs. He also made creative judgments concerning technical matters with his camera and
the use of natural light. He prepared a set of ""contact sheets,"" containing 50 different images, from which one was selected.

After the Scanlons purchased their prints for $200, ""Puppies"" became part of Rogers' catalogue of images available for
further use, from which he, like many professional photographers, makes his living. ""Puppies"" has been used and exhibited a


--- Page 2 ---
number of times. A signed print of it has been sold to a private collector, and in 1989 it was licensed for use in an anthology
called ""Dog Days."" Rogers also planned to use the picture in a series of hand-tinted prints of his works. In 1984 Rogers had
licensed ""Puppies"", along with other works, to Museum Graphics, a company that produces and sells notecards and
postcards with high quality reproductions of photographs by well-respected American photographers including, for example,
Ansel Adams. Museum Graphics has produced and distributed the ""Puppies"" notecard since 1984. The first printing was of
5,000 copies and there has been a second similar size printing.

C. Koons

Defendant Jeff Koons is a 37-year-old artist and sculptor residing in New York City. After receiving a Bachelor of Fine
Arts degree from Maryland Institute College of Art in 1976, he worked at a number of jobs, principally membership
development at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. While pursuing his career as an artist, he also worked until 1984 as
a mutual funds salesman, a registered commodities salesman and broker, and a commodities futures broker. In the ten
years from 1980 to 1990 Koons has exhibited his works in approximately 100 Group Exhibitions and in eleven one-man
shows. His bibliography is extensive. Koons is represented by Sonnabend Gallery, New York, Donald Young Gallery,
Chicago, and Galerie Max Hetzler, Cologne, Germany. His works sell at very substantial prices, over $100,000. He is a
controversial artist hailed by some as a ""modern Michelangelo,"" while others find his art ""truly offensive."" A New York Times
critic complained that ""Koons is pushing the relationship between art and money so far that everyone involved comes out
looking slightly absurd.""

D. Creating the Sculpture ""String of Puppies""

After a successful Sonnabend show in 1986, Koons began creating a group of 20 sculptures for a 1988 exhibition at the
same gallery that he called the ""Banality Show."" He works in an art tradition dating back to the beginning of the twentieth
century. This tradition defines its efforts as follows: when the artist finishes his work, the meaning of the original object has
been extracted and an entirely new meaning set in its place. An example is Andy Warhol's reproduction of multiple images
of Campbell's soup cans. Koons' most famous work in this genre is a stainless steel casting of an inflatable rabbit holding a
carrot. During 1986 and 1987 the sculptor traveled widely in Europe looking at materials and workshops where he might
fabricate materials for the Banality Show. He decided to use porcelain, mirrors and wood as mediums. Certain European
studios were chosen to execute his

Page 305

porcelain works, other studios chosen for the mirror pieces, and the small Demetz Studio, located in the northern hill country
town of Ortessi, Italy, was selected to carve the wood sculptures.

Koons acknowledges that the source for ""String of Puppies"" was a Museum Graphics notecard of ""Puppies"" which he
purchased in a ""very commercial, tourist-like card shop"" in 1987. After buying the card, he tore off that portion showing
Rogers' copyright of ""Puppies."" Koons saw certain criteria in the notecard that he thought made it a workable source. He
believed it to be typical, commonplace and familiar. The notecard was also similar to other images of people holding animals
that Koons had collected. Thus, he viewed the picture as part of the mass culture--""resting in the collective sub-
consciousness of people regardless of whether the card had actually ever been seen by such people.""

Appellant gave his artisans one of Rogers’ notecards and told them to copy it. But in order to guide the creation of a
three-dimensional sculptural piece from the two-dimensional photograph, Koons communicated extensively with the Demetz
Studio. He visited it once a week during the period the piece was being carved by the workers and gave them written
instructions. In his ""production notes"" Koons stressed that he wanted ""Puppies"" copied faithfully in the sculpture. For
example, he told his artisans the ""work must be just like photo--features of photo must be captured;"" later, ""puppies need
detail in fur. Details--Just Like Photo!;"" other notes instruct the artisans to ""keep man in angle of photo--mild lean to side &
mildly forward--same for woman,"" to ""keep woman's big smile,"" and to ""keep [the sculpture] very, very realistic;"" others state,
""Girl's nose is too small. Please make larger as per photo;"" another reminds the artisans that ""The puppies must have
variation in fur as per photo--not just large area of paint--variation as per photo."" (emphasis supplied).

To paint the polychromed wood ""String of Puppies"" sculptures, Koons provided a chart with an enlarged photocopy of
""Puppies"" in the center; painting directions were noted in the margin with arrows drawn to various areas of the photograph.
The chart noted, ""Puppies, painted in shades of blue. Variation of light-to-dark as per photo. Paint realistic as per photo, but
in blues."" and ""Man's hair, white with shades of grey as per black and white photo!"" (emphasis supplied).

When it was finished, ""String of Puppies"" was displayed at the Sonnabend Gallery, which opened the Banality Show on
November 19, 1988. Three of the four copies made were sold to collectors for a total of $367,000; the fourth or artist's copy
was kept by Koons. Defendant Koons' use of ""Puppies"" to create ""String of Puppies"" was not authorized by plaintiff. Rogers
learned of Koons' unauthorized use of his work through Jim Scanlon, the man who had commissioned Rogers to create
""Puppies."" A friend of Scanlon's, who was familiar with the photograph, called to tell him that what she took to be a
""colorized"" version of ""Puppies"" was on the front page of the calendar section of the May 7, 1989 Sunday Los Angeles
Times. In fact, as she and Scanlon later learned, the newspaper actually depicted Koons' ""String of Puppies"" in connection
with an article about its exhibition at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.

PRIOR PROCEEDINGS

Rogers brought this action against Koons and Sonnabend Gallery on October 11, 1989, alleging copyright infringement


--- Page 3 ---
and unfair competition under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act and under state law. Both sides advised the district court at an early
stage of the proceedings that, at least as to copyright infringement, disputed factual issues were unlikely and disposition on
summary judgment would probably be appropriate. After completion of discovery, both sides moved for that relief on July 5,
1990. Rogers' motion was limited to the copyright infringement claim. Koons and the Sonnabend Gallery sought summary
judgment dismissing all counts in plaintiff's complaint.

Page 306

The district court held oral argument on November 26, 1990. In a December 10, 1990 decision, described more fully
below, it found that Koons copied ""Puppies"" in ""String of Puppies"" and that this copying was not a fair use. It therefore found
infringement, 751 F.Supp. 474 . Rogers' motion for an infringing profits award was denied because the trial court believed
there were disputed questions of fact concerning their computation. As to Sonnabend Gallery, the district court concluded on
February 22, 1991 that the record showed Sonnabend's as well as Koons’ liability for infringing profits. On March 27, 1991 it
entered a permanent injunction enjoining Koons and Sonnabend Gallery from making, selling, lending or displaying any
copies of, or derivative works based on, ""Puppies,"" and, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 503, requiring defendants to deliver all
infringing articles to plaintiff within 20 days, including the fourth or artist's copy of ""String of Puppies.""

When defendants failed to comply with the turn-over order, Rogers moved to hold defendant Koons in contempt. The
proceedings on that motion revealed that nine days after the injunction was issued, Koons had loaned the fourth copy of
""String of Puppies"" to a museum in Germany and arranged for its shipment out of the United States. After a hearing on May
8, 1991 the district court held Koons in contempt, directed him to do whatever was necessary to effect the sculpture's return
from Germany, and imposed a daily fine for continued non-compliance to commence eight days later.

On May 28, 1991 we denied Koons' motion to stay the injunction and the contempt penalty pending appeal, but
delayed the commencement of the daily fine until June 7, 1991. From the finding of copyright infringement, the granting of a
permanent injunction, and the turn-over order appellants Koons and Sonnabend appeal. Rogers cross-appeals from the
denial of an award prior to trial for infringing profits. We affirm.

DISCUSSION
| Ownership of Copyright in an Original Work of Art

One of the powers given Congress under Art. |, § 8 of the United States Constitution is: ""To promote the Progress of
Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors, the exclusive Right to their respective
Writings and Discoveries."" Madison noted that ""[T]he utility of this power will scarcely be questioned."" The Federalist No. 43
(Madison) at 279. He further observed that copyright for authors was their right under common law. Id.; see 2 Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England 407 (Univ. of Chicago ed. 1979). As a result, Congress enacted a copyright law, 17
U.S.C. § 101 et seq. (1976), under which the instant litigation was instituted.

To establish an infringement of a copyright, a plaintiff must show both ownership of a copyright and that defendant
copied the protected material without authorization. See Weissmann v. Freeman, 868 F.2d 1313 , 1320 (2d Cir.), cert.
denied, 493 U.S. 883 , 110 S.Ct. 219 , 107 L.Ed.2d 172 (1989) . The Copyright Act makes a certificate of registration from
the U.S. Register of Copyrights prima facie evidence of the valid ownership of a copyright, see 17 U.S.C. § 410(c), though
that presumption of ownership may be rebutted, see Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v. Sparkle Toys. Inc.. 780 F.2d 189 , 192 (2d
Cir.1985). Protection under the copyright statute extends to pictorial works, 17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(5). For more than a century
photographs have been held to be copyrightable ""writings"" under Article |, § 8 of the Constitution. Burrow-Giles Lithographic
Co. v. Sarony, 111 U.S. 53 , 4 S.Ct. 279 , 28 L.Ed. 349 (1884) (photograph of Oscar Wilde an original work of art).

Of the several issues before us, the first concerns the originality of ""Puppies."" Defendants do not challenge plaintiff's
ownership of a valid copyright, but assert instead that the portion of Rogers’ work allegedly infringed was not an original
work of authorship protected under the

Page 307

1976 Copyright Act. Since the law protects authors’ exclusive rights to their works, the cornerstone of that law is that the
work protected must be original. See Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct.
1282 1287, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) . Thus, that a whole work is copyrighted does not mean that every element of it is
copyrighted; copyright protection extends only to those components of the work that are original to the creator. Id. 111 S.Ct.
at 1289 . But the quantity of originality that need be shown is modest--only a dash of it will do. Id. at 1287; 1 M. Nimmer & D.
Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 1.08[C] (1991) (Nimmer).

Elements of originality in a photograph may include posing the subjects, lighting, angle, selection of film and camera,
evoking the desired expression, and almost any other variant involved. See Burrow Giles, 111 U.S. at 60 , 4 S.Ct. at 282 . 1
Nimmer, § 2.08[E]. To the extent that these factors are involved, ""Puppies"" is the product of plaintiff's artistic creation.
Rogers' inventive efforts in posing the group for the photograph, taking the picture, and printing ""Puppies"" suffices to meet
the original work of art criteria. Thus, in terms of his unique expression of the subject matter captured in the photograph,
plaintiff has established valid ownership of a copyright in an original work of art.

Il Unauthorized Copying by Defendant

Plaintiff next must demonstrate that defendant Koons copied his protected work without authorization. The district court


--- Page 4 ---
granted summary judgment to Rogers on this issue, finding Koons' sculpture ""String of Puppies"" an unauthorized copy of
Rogers' photograph. Summary judgment may be an appropriate remedy in copyright infringement suits. See, e.g., Peter Pan
Fabrics, Inc. v. Dan River Mills. Inc., 295 F.Supp. 1366 , 1369 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 415 F.2d 1007 (2d Cir.1969) . Yet, such relief
will be denied when the question of substantial similarity is one on which reasonable minds could differ. See, e.g., Twentieth
Century-Fox Film Corp. v. MCA, Inc., 715 F.2d 1327 , 1329 (9th Cir.1983).

Here, the trial court found original elements of creative expression in the copyrighted work were copied and that the
copying was so blatantly apparent as not to require a trial. We agree that no reasonable juror could find that copying did not
occur in this case. First, this case presents the rare scenario where there is direct evidence of copying. Koons admittedly
gave a copy of the photograph to the Italian artisans with the explicit instruction that the work be copied. Moreover, the
importance of copying the very details of the photograph that embodied plaintiff's original contribution--the poses, the
shading, the expressions--was stressed by Koons throughout the creation of the sculpture. His instructions invariably
implored that the creation must be designed ""as per photo."" This undisputed direct evidence of copying is sufficient to
support the district court's granting of summary judgment.

Further, even were such direct evidence of copying unavailable, the district court's decision could be upheld in this case
on the basis that defendant Koons' access to the copyrighted work is conceded, and the accused work is so substantially
similar to the copyrighted work that reasonable jurors could not differ on this issue. See Warner Brothers, Inc. v. American
Broadcasting Cos.. Inc., 654 F.2d 204 , 207 (2d Cir.1981).

Substantial similarity does not require literally identical copying of every detail. See 3 Nimmer, § 13.03[A]. See also
Comptone Company Ltd. v. Rayex Corp., 251 F.2d 487 , 488 (2d Cir.1958). Such similarity is determined by the ordinary
observer test: the inquiry is ""whether an average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been
appropriated from the copyrighted work."" Ideal Toy Corp. v. Fab-Lu Ltd., 360 F.2d 1021 , 1022 (2d Cir.1966). Or, stated
another way, whether ""the ordinary observer, unless he set out to detect the disparities, would be disposed to overlook them,
and regard their aesthetic appeal as the same."" Peter Pan

Page 308

Fabrics. Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487 , 489 (2d Cir.1960). Thus, Koons’ allegation that a trial judge uneducated
in art is not an appropriate decision-maker misses the mark; the decision-maker, whether it be a judge or a jury, need not
have any special skills other than to be a reasonable and average lay person.

We recognize that ideas, concepts, and the like found in the common domain are the inheritance of everyone. What is
protected is the original or unique way that an author expresses those ideas, concepts, principles or processes. Hence, in
looking at these two works of art to determine whether they are substantially similar, focus must be on the similarity of the
expression of an idea or fact, not on the similarity of the facts, ideas or concepts themselves. See Durham Industries, Inc. v.
Tomy Corp., 630 F.2d 905 , 912 (2d Cir.1980). It is not therefore the idea of a couple with eight small puppies seated on a
bench that is protected, but rather Roger's expression of this idea--as caught in the placement, in the particular light, and in
the expressions of the subjects--that gives the photograph its charming and unique character, that is to say, makes it original
and copyrightable.

Thus, had appellant simply used the idea presented by the photo, there would not have been infringing copying. But
here Koons used the identical expression of the idea that Rogers created; the composition, the poses, and the expressions
were all incorporated into the sculpture to the extent that, under the ordinary observer test, we conclude that no reasonable
jury could have differed on the issue of substantial similarity. For this reason, the district court properly held that Koons
""copied"" the original.

Moreover, no copier may defend the act of plagiarism by pointing out how much of the copy he has not pirated. See
Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 81 F.2d 49 , 56 (2d Cir.) (L. Hand, J.), cert. denied, 298 U.S. 669 , 56 S.Ct. 835 ,
80 L.Ed. 1392 (1936) . Thus, where substantial similarity is found, small changes here and there made by the copier are
unavailing. It is only where the points of dissimilarity exceed those that are similar and those similar are--when compared to
the original work--of small import quantitatively or qualitatively that a finding of no infringement is appropriate. See 3 Nimmer
§ 13.03[B][a]. This is not the case here. Koons' additions, such as the flowers in the hair of the couple and the bulbous
noses of the puppies, are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact with regard to copying in light of the
overwhelming similarity to the protected expression of the original work.

Because of Koons' extensive use of the same expression of the idea that Rogers' created, it was properly held that he
""copied"" the protected features of the original. No genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to this finding; ""String of
Puppies"" was copied from the photograph ""Puppies"" based either on the direct evidence of copying or on proof of access
and substantial similarity. In light of this summary judgment was properly granted on this issue.

Ill The Fair Use Doctrine

Defendant Koons further defends his use of Rogers' work ""Puppies"" to craft ""String of Puppies"" under a claim of a
privilege of ""fair use."" This equitable doctrine permits other people to use copyrighted material without the owner's consent in
a reasonable manner for certain purposes. Codified in § 107 of the 1976 Copyright Act, it is of ancient lineage. Section 107
states that an original work copied for purposes such as criticism or comment may not constitute infringement, but instead
may be a fair use. The section provides an illustrative--but not exhaustive--list of factors for determining when a use is ""fair.""
These factors include (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and


--- Page 5 ---
substantiality of the work used, and (4) the effect of the use on the market value of the original. 17 U.S.C. § 107.

The fact that the test envisioned by the Act is dependent on the circumstances of each case, see 3 Nimmer, § 13.05[A],
might suggest summary judgment is unavailable

when fair use is the issue, but such relief may be granted when appropriate. See e.g., Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207 , 110
S.Ct. 1750 , 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) (summary judgment granted upon finding of no fair use). The trial court found no
genuine issues of fact present regarding the fair use exception and granted summary judgment to plaintiff on this issue also.
We proceed therefore to analyze the fair use factors in the circumstances of the case at hand. Our examination of these
factors leads us to conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff.

1. Purpose and Character of the Use

The first factor, purpose and character of the use, asks whether the original was copied in good faith to benefit the
public or primarily for the commercial interests of the infringer. See MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 677 F.2d 180 , 182 (2d Cir.1981).
Knowing exploitation of a copyrighted work for personal gain militates against a finding of fair use. And--because it is an
equitable doctrine--wrongful denial of exploitative conduct towards the work of another may bar an otherwise legitimate fair
use claim. See 3 Nimmer, § 13.05[A]. Relevant to this issue is Koons' conduct, especially his action in tearing the copyright
mark off of a Rogers notecard prior to sending it to the Italian artisans. This action suggests bad faith in defendant's use of
plaintiffs work, and militates against a finding of fair use.

The Supreme Court has held that copies made for commercial or profit-making purposes are presumptively unfair. See
Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios. Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 449, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 792, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) . The
Court explained in a subsequent case that the ""crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of the
use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the
customary price."" Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises. 471 U.S. 539 , 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218 2231, 85
L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . We have stated that, though it is a significant factor, whether the profit element of the fair use calculus
affects the ultimate determination of whether there is a fair use depends on the totality of the factors considered; it is not
itself controlling. See Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell, 803 F.2d 1253 , 1262 (2d Cir.1986), cert. denied,481 U.S. 1059 , 107
S.Ct. 2201 , 95 L.Ed.2d 856 (1987) . Thus, while we note that Koons' substantial profit from his intentionally exploitive use of
Rogers' work also militates against the finding of fair use, we turn next to consider his contention that the primary purpose of
the use was for social comment.

Parody or Satire as Fair Use: The Act expressly provides that comment on or criticism of a copyrighted work may be a
valid use under the fair use doctrine. We must analyze therefore whether ""String of Puppies"" is properly considered a
comment on or criticism of the photograph ""Puppies."" Koons argues that his sculpture is a satire or parody of society at
large. He insists that ""String of Puppies"" is a fair social criticism and asserts to support that proposition that he belongs to the
school of American artists who believe the mass production of commodities and media images has caused a deterioration in
the quality of society, and this artistic tradition of which he is a member proposes through incorporating these images into
works of art to comment critically both on the incorporated object and the political and economic system that created it.
These themes, Koons states, draw upon the artistic movements of Cubism and Dadaism, with particular influence attributed
to Marcel Duchamp, who in 1913 became the first to incorporate manufactured objects (readymades) into a work of art,
directly influencing Koons' work and the work of other contemporary American artists. We accept this definition of the
objective of this group of American artists.

To analyze Koons' parody defense, we must first define it. Parody or satire, as we understand it, is when one artist, for
comic effect or social commentary, closely imitates the style of another artist and in so doing creates a new art work that
makes ridiculous the style and expression

Page 310

of the original. Under our cases parody and satire are valued forms of criticism, encouraged because this sort of criticism
itself fosters the creativity protected by the copyright law. See Warner Bros.., Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos.., Inc., 720
F.2d 231 , 242 (2d Cir.1983). We have consistently held that a parody entitles its creator under the fair use doctrine to more
extensive use of the copied work than is ordinarily allowed under the substantial similarity test. See Elsmere Music, Inc. v.
National Broadcasting Co., 623 F.2d 252 , 253 (2d Cir.1980) (per curiam).

Hence, it must first be determined whether ""String of Puppies"" is a parody of Rogers’ work for purposes of the fair use
doctrine. We agree with the district court that it is not. It is the rule in this Circuit that though the satire need not be only of
the copied work and may, as appellants urge of ""String of Puppies,"" also be a parody of modern society, the copied work
must be, at least in part, an object of the parody, otherwise there would be no need to conjure up the original work. See
MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 677 F.2d at 185 ; 3 Nimmer, § 13.05[C] n. 60.9.

We think this is a necessary rule, as were it otherwise there would be no real limitation on the copier's use of another's
copyrighted work to make a statement on some aspect of society at large. If an infringement of copyrightable expression
could be justified as fair use solely on the basis of the infringer's claim to a higher or different artistic use--without insuring
public awareness of the original work--there would be no practicable boundary to the fair use defense. Koons' claim that his
infringement of Rogers' work is fair use solely because he is acting within an artistic tradition of commenting upon the



--- Page 6 ---
commonplace thus cannot be accepted. The rule's function is to insure that credit is given where credit is due. By requiring
that the copied work be an object of the parody, we merely insist that the audience be aware that underlying the parody
there is an original and separate expression, attributable to a different artist. This awareness may come from the fact that
the copied work is publicly known or because its existence is in some manner acknowledged by the parodist in connection
with the parody. Of course, while our view of this matter does not necessarily prevent Koons' expression, although it may, it
does recognize that any such exploitation must at least entail ""paying the customary price."" Harper & Row Publishers, Inc.,
471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. at 2231 .

The problem in the instant case is that even given that ""String of Puppies"" is a satirical critique of our materialistic
society, it is difficult to discern any parody of the photograph ""Puppies"" itself. We conclude therefore that this first factor of
the fair use doctrine cuts against a finding of fair use. The circumstances of this case indicate that Koons' copying of the
photograph ""Puppies"" was done in bad faith, primarily for profit-making motives, and did not constitute a parody of the
original work.

2. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The next fair use factor asks what is the nature of the work that has been copied. Where the original work is factual
rather than fictional the scope of fair use is broader. See New Era Publications. Int'l. v. Carol Publishing Group, 904 F.2d 152
, 157 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 297 , 112 L.Ed.2d 251 (1990) . Whether the original is creative,
imaginative, or represents an investment of time in anticipation of a financial return also should be considered. MCA, Inc. v.
Wilson, 677 F.2d at 182 . Here ""Puppies"" was a published work of art. As an original expression it has more in common with
fiction than with works based on facts, such as, for example, biographies or telephone directories. Since ""Puppies"" was
creative and imaginative and Rogers, who makes his living as a photographer, hopes to gain a financial return for his efforts
with this photograph, this factor militates against a finding of fair use.

3. Amount and Substantiality of Work Used
Where the amount of copying exceeds permissible levels, summary judgment
Page 311

has been upheld. Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, 581 F.2d 751 , 758 (9th Cir.1978), cert. denied,439 U.S. 1132 ,99
S.Ct. 1054 , 59 L.Ed.2d 94 (1979) . To a large degree, this factor involves the same analysis as that used when determining
if the copy is substantially similar to the original. Sometimes wholesale copying may be permitted, while in other cases
taking even a small percentage of the original work has been held unfair use. See Maxtone-Graham, 803 F.2d at 1263 .""
[What is relevant is the amount and substantiality of the copyrighted expression that has been used, not the factual content
of the material in the copyrighted works."" Salinger v. Random House, Inc., 811 F.2d 90 , 97 (2d Cir.) (emphasis in original),
reh'g denied, 818 F.2d 252 , cert. denied, 484 U.S. 890 , 108 S.Ct. 213 , 98 L.Ed.2d 177 (1987) . It is not fair use when more
of the original is copied than necessary. Even more critical than the quantity is the qualitative degree of the copying: what
degree of the essence of the original is copied in relation to its whole. Id. at 98; see also New Era Publications Int'l., 904
F.2d at 159 .

Appellants claim that under a parody defense their use of Rogers’ work did not exceed the level permitted under the fair
use doctrine. As discussed previously, this Circuit has traditionally afforded parodists significant leeway with respect to the
extent and nature of their copying. See Elsmere, 623 F.2d at 253 , n. 1; Berlin v. E.C. Publications, Inc., 329 F.2d 541 , 545
(2d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 822 , 85 S.Ct. 46 , 13 L.Ed.2d 33 (1964) . Yet, even under such a defense there are
limitations on what constitutes fair use. See MCA v. Wilson, 677 F.2d at 185 . Here, the essence of Rogers’ photograph was
copied nearly in toto, much more than would have been necessary even if the sculpture had been a parody of plaintiff's
work. In short, it is not really the parody flag that appellants are sailing under, but rather the flag of piracy. Moreover,
because we have already determined that ""String of Puppies"" is not a parody of Rogers' work, appellants cannot avail
themselves of this heightened tolerance under a parody defense.

Nor does Sony Corp. of America, 464 U.S. at 449-50 , 104 S.Ct. at 792-93 , bear the weight that appellants place on it
for the proposition that even 100 percent copying does not preclude a fair use finding. Although correct as a general
statement, it applied in Sony to a narrow set of circumstances. Sony's copying equipment (Betamax VCRs) was used by
members of the public to record television programs--the copyright of which was owned by plaintiffs. The question was
whether Sony's selling of the copying equipment violated plaintiffs’ rights under the Copyright Act. The Supreme Court said
""no"" because ""time-shifting"" for those watching a television program enlarges the viewing audience, and does not impair
plaintiffs’ commercial right in the value of the copyright. Hence, no basis existed under the Act upon which plaintiffs could
hold Sony liable for selling VCR's to the general public. Id. at 421, 104 S.Ct. at 778 .

Those are not the facts found here. Instead, Koons' copying of Rogers’ work was the essence of the photograph, and
designedly done as the notes to the Italian artisans conclusively reveal. Koons went well beyond the factual subject matter
of the photograph to incorporate the very expression of the work created by Rogers. We find that no reasonable jury could
conclude that Koons did not exceed a permissible level of copying under the fair use doctrine.

4. Effect of the Use on the Market Value of the Original

The fourth factor looks at the effect of the use on the market value of the original. The Supreme Court in Stewart, 495
U.S. 207 , 110 S.Ct. 1750 , 109 L.Ed.2d 184 , stated that the fourth factor ""is the 'most important, and indeed, central fair use



--- Page 7 ---
factor.'"" Id. at 238, 110 S.Ct. at 1769 (quoting 3 Nimmer § 13.05[A]; see also Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. at
2233 . Under this factor a balance must be struck between the benefit gained by the copyright owner when the copying is
found an unfair use and the benefit gained by the public when the use is held to be fair. The less adverse impact on the
owner, the less

Page 312

public benefit need be shown to sustain non-commercial fair use. It is plain that where a use has no demonstrable impact on
a copyright owners' potential market, the use need not be prohibited to protect the artist's incentive to pursue his inventive
skills. Yet where the use is intended for commercial gain some meaningful likelihood of future harm is presumed. See Sony
Corp. of America, 464 U.S. at 451 , 104 S.Ct. at 793 .

A critical inquiry under this factor then is whether defendants Koons and Sonnabend planned to profit from their
exploitation of ""Puppies"" without paying Rogers for their use of his photo--that is, whether Koons' work is primarily
commercial in nature. We have already concluded that it is. In this case, of course, the copy was in a different medium than
the original: one was a three-dimensional piece of sculpture, and the other a two-dimensional black and white photo. But the
owner of a copyright with respect to this market-factor need only demonstrate that if the unauthorized use becomes
""widespread"" it would prejudice his potential market for his work. See id.; Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 568 , 105 S.Ct. at 2234
. The reason for this rule relates to a central concern of copyright law that unfair copying undercuts demand for the original
work and, as an inevitable consequence, chills creation of such works. Hence the inquiry considers not only harm to the
market for the original photograph, but also harm to the market for derivative works. It is obviously not implausible that
another artist, who would be willing to purchase the rights from Rogers, would want to produce a sculpture like Rogers' photo
and, with Koons' work extant, such market is reduced. Similarly, defendants could take and sell photos of ""String of
Puppies,"" which would prejudice Rogers' potential market for the sale of the ""Puppies"" notecards, in addition to any other
derivative use he might plan.

Further, in discussing this fourth factor, the leading scholar in this area of the law uses an example that closely parallels
the facts of the present case and demonstrates the irrelevance of copying in a different medium when analyzing this factor: a
movie adaptation is made of a book. Even though the movie may boost book sales, it is an unfair use because of the effect
on the potential sale of adaptation rights. 3 Nimmer, § 13.05[B]. The function of demand for each original work of art is a
relevant facet in this factor's analysis; that is, fair use permits lyrics or music to be copied in a literary magazine, but where
the same material is published in a song sheet magazine, purchased for playing and not simply for reading, it is an unfair
use. Id.

Here there is simply nothing in the record to support a view that Koons produced ""String of Puppies"" for anything other
than sale as high-priced art. Hence, the likelihood of future harm to Rogers' photograph is presumed, and plaintiff's market
for his work has been prejudiced.

IV Infringing Profits

The next issue concerns Rogers' claim for infringing profits in the amount of $367,000. Under 17 U.S.C. § 504(b) a
copyright owner is entitled to recover actual damages suffered as a result of the infringement as well as apportioned profits.
The section states: ""In establishing the infringer's profits, the copyright owner is required to present proof only of the
infringer's gross revenue, and the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit
attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work."" Alternatively, in place of actual damages and apportioned profits, a
copyright owner may elect to recover an award of statutory damages. See 17 U.S.C. § 504(c).

In Rogers’ cross-appeal he asserts, in response to defendants' argument that we lack appellate jurisdiction over this
issue, that jurisdiction exists on two independent bases. He further contends that there are no issues of fact and that the
matter should be remanded simply to enter an award in his favor. Although we agree with Rogers that jurisdiction over this
aspect of the judgment appealed from exists, we are unable to grant the award he seeks.

Page 313

The district court stated that deposition and documentary evidence regarding the deductible expenses referred to in §
504(b) are present in the record. We are satisfied that defendants have incurred deductible expenses in some amount and
that they should have an opportunity to prove them as an offset to plaintiff's evidence of infringing damages. Further, the
amount of actual damages incurred by Rogers, as well as the proper apportionment of Koons' profits between Rogers and
Koons, remain to be determined on remand. With respect to the calculation of actual damages, ""the primary measure of
recovery is the extent to which the market value of the copyrighted work at the time of the infringement has been injured or
destroyed by the infringement."" Fitzgerald Pub. Co., Inc. v. Baylor Pub. Co., Inc., 807 F.2d 1110 , 1118 (2d Cir.1986). While
we leave the ascertainment of damages to the district court, under the circumstances of this case, we think that a
reasonable license fee for the use of ""Puppies"" best approximates the market injury sustained by Rogers as a result of
Koons' misappropriation. See Deltak, Inc. v. Advanced Systems, Inc., 767 F.2d 357 , 360-61 (7th Cir.1985) (""The value of
the infringer's use is a permissible basis for estimating actual damages.""); Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v.
McDonald's Corp., 562 F.2d 1157 , 1174 (9th Cir.1977) (same).

On the subject of apportioning profits, the copyright law requires that Koons have the opportunity to establish those
""elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 504(b). These ""elements"" may
include Koons' own notoriety and his related ability to command high prices for his work. See Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn



--- Page 8 ---
Corp., 309 U.S. 390 , 407-09, 60 S.Ct. 681 , 687-88, 84 L.Ed. 825 (1940) (considering ""the drawing power of the 'motion
picture stars' ... the artistic conceptions ... and ... the expert supervision and direction of the various processes which made
possible the composite result""); Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., 886 F.2d 1545 , 1549 (9th Cir.1989), cert.
denied, 494 U.S. 1017 , 110 S.Ct. 1321 , 108 L.Ed.2d 496 (1990) (""Where a defendant alters infringing material to suit its
own unique purposes, those alterations and the creativity behind them should be taken into account in apportioning the
profits of the infringing work.""); Abend v. MCA, Inc., 863 F.2d 1465 , 1478, aff'd sub nom. Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207 ,
110 S.Ct. 1750 , 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) (considering outstanding performances and brilliant direction); ABKCO Music, Inc.
v. Harrisongs Music, 508 F.Supp. 798 , 801 (S.D.N.Y.1981), modified, 722 F.2d 988 (2d Cir.1983) (considering ""international
‘name' "" of infringing recording artist). See also 3 Nimmer § 14.03[C]. To the extent that Koons is able to prove that the
profits at issue derive solely from his own position in the art world, he should be allowed to retain them.

Finally, we note that Rogers remains at liberty to elect statutory damages in lieu of an award of actual damages and
apportioned profits. See 17 U.S.C. § 504(c). In fact, given Koons' wilful and egregious behavior, we think Rogers may be a
good candidate for enhanced statutory damages pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2). See Fitzgerald Pub. Co., 807 F.2d at
1115 . Of course, that determination remains for the district court to make in the first instance.

The case must be remanded therefore for the district court to determine the amount of the award, a matter which it had
reserved to itself prior to the institution of this appeal.

V The Turn-Over Order

Finally, the turn-over order of the artist's copy is an equitable remedy issued under the broad powers vested in a trial
judge under 17 U.S.C. § 503(b) (court may order destruction or other reasonable disposition of infringing copies). In this
case, after Judge Haight issued his turn-over order, Koons arranged to ship the fourth or artist's copy of ""String of Puppies""
from the United States to Germany. We see no abuse of the district court's discretion in directing turn-over and, under the
circumstances, the contempt order for the direct violation of the turn-over order was entirely proper.

Page 314
CONCLUSION

Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in all respects.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

REBECCA R. PALLMEYER, United States District Judge

Plaintiff Amanda Myers is a dance instructor and choreographer. In this lawsuit, Myers alleges that Defendants Christina
Harold and the company she owns, The Dance Shop, Inc. (""TDS""), infringed Myers's copyright in dances that Myers created
while Myers worked as a dance instructor at TDS from 2011 to 2015. Myers choreographed dances for students on TDS's
dance team. Myers left her position at TDS before the 2014-2015 dance season was over, however, and, at TDS's end-of-
season recital and at three summer festivals, TDS students performed dances that Myers claims to have choreographed in
2014 and 2015. Myers alleges that Harold and TDS are liable for copyright infringement and unjust enrichment for profiting
from, organizing, and contributing to these performances. Defendants seek summary judgment, arguing that some of the
works are not eligible for copyright; that the dances were works made for hire; or that TDS had a license to perform them.
Myers disputes these defenses, and seeks summary judgment in her favor on certain claims. For the reasons stated below,
Defendants’ motion is denied and Myers's motion is granted in part and denied in part.

BACKGROUND
I. Myers and The Dance Shop

Amanda Myers is a choreographer. (PI.'s LR 56.1 Statement of Material Facts in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (""PSOF"") [38]
44 1-3.) 4 Tina Harold is the president and sole owner of The Dance Shop, which is

[279 F.Supp.3d 782]

located in Chicago Ridge, Illinois and provides dance classes to adults and children. (Defs.' Joint Resp. to Pl.'s L.R. 56.1(a)
Statement of Material Facts in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (""Defs.' Resp. to PSOF"") [56] 44 4, 6-7.) In September 2011,
Harold posted an advertisement for a dance instructor on Craigslist.com. (Defs.' L.R. 56.1(a) Statement of Facts (""DSOF"")
[53] 4 10.) The ad reads:

Dance Instructor needed for new dance studio opening in Sept.
Teaching Tap, Jazz, and Ballet to children 3-17 years of age. Must be strong in Tap. Serious Applicants only.
Part time on Saturdays and two nights during the week.

(Ex. 3 to PI.'s L.R. 56.1(b)(3)(B) Resp. to Defs.' Fact Statement [55-4].) 2 Myers responded to the ad, and Harold
interviewed her. Harold testified that she explained to Myers that the dance instructor was expected to create dances for the
students to perform. (Dep. of Tina Harold, Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (""Harold Dep."") [37-2] 100:4—
16; see Decl. of Tina Harold, Ex. B to DSOF [53-1 at p. 5] (""Harold Decl."") § 9.) Myers denies that there was any discussion
of choreographing dances during the interview. (PI.'s L.R. 56.1(b)(3)(B) Resp. to Defs.' Fact Statement (""Pl.'s Resp. to
DSOF"") [55] ¥ 12.) Myers was hired for the position and began teaching dance classes at TDS that same month. (PSOF 4
12; DSOF 6.)

TDS's ""work for hire"" defense turns, in part, on the nature of Myers' employment relationship with TDS. The parties dispute
many of the facts surrounding this relationship; the most prominent dispute concerns precisely what work TDS paid Myers to
perform. Myers was paid an hourly rate that changed over time ( see Defs.' Resp. to PSOF 20; Pl.'s Resp. to DSOF {| 14)),
and the parties agree that she was paid for the hours that she taught dance, and for various office administrative tasks. ( See
Defs.' Resp. to PSOF § 20; Pl.'s Resp. to DSOF 4 13, 15.) Myers also testified that Harold gave her bonuses (she could

not recall the amounts) for each full dance season that she taught at TDS. ( /d. at 54:7-55:22.)

The parties disagree, however, about whether Myers was compensated for time she spent choreographing dances to teach


--- Page 2 ---
in her classes. This issue is whether the choreography occurred during class time, which Myers was paid for, or outside of
class time, during uncompensated hours. Defendants contend that the choreography occurred during class time, and that
Myers's hourly wage therefore compensated her for the time spent choreographing dances. (Defs.' Resp. to PSOF 20;
Harold Dep. 66:24-67:12.) In support, Defendants cite Myers's testimony that she spent time ""develop[ing]"" dance moves
""into a routine"" during class time:

Q: What were you hired to do at The Dance Shop?
A: Teach dance.

Q: To teach dance routines or dance techniques?
A: It was just teach dance.

Q: Does that mean teaching dance moves?

A: | mean it all goes along with that. You teach technique, you teach move terminology and you develop all that
into a routine.

Q: Okay. Were you hired to teach routine?
[Objection omitted]
A: Yes.

(Dep. of Amanda Myers, Ex. B to Defs.' App. in Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J. (""Myers Dep."") [58-2] 70:16—71:6.). Defendants
acknowledge that Myers prepared some choreography prior to the first day

[279 F.Supp.3d 783]

of class, 2 but they point out that Myers then refined choreographed routines during class time. ( See Defs.' Joint Resp. to
Pl.'s L.R. 56(1)(b)(3)(C) Additional Statement of Material Facts (""Defs.' Resp. to PSOAF"") [62] 4 84.) Myers herself
acknowledges that she refined her choreography during class time: she explained that she went to class ""with pre-
choreographed routines which may or may not work once you actually put it on the kids[,]"" and she and her students would
""work on combinations and dances"" in class. (Myers Dep. 45:12—19.) But some of the time she spent preparing the ""pre-
choreographed routines"" was outside the classroom, Myers asserts. ( /d. at 119:15-120:6.) And although Myers was paid for
her self-reported hours of work, she did not report time outside of the dance classes devoted to choreographing these
routines. ( See id. at 72:4—73:1.) As a result, Myers contends, she was paid only for her teaching time, not for time she spent
choreographing. 4( See id. at 45:12-19.)

Defendants interpret Myers's testimony that she was paid only for class time as support for their position that she was
therefore paid for all of her choreography time. (See DSOF { 15; Defs.' Resp. to PSOF { 20 (citing Myers Dep. 54:2-6).
Defendants also emphasize that Myers was paid for all the time she reported to TDS (Defs.' Resp. to PSOF {ff 20, 23), and
note her testimony that she did not think she was allowed to report time that she spent on administrative tasks for TDS. (
See Myers Dep. 72:13-73:1, 115:19-116:7.) 5 That testimony is not inconsistent with Myers's claim, however, that she also
performed choreography outside of class time, did not report that time, and was not paid for it.

In addition to the issue of compensation, the parties dispute the amount of control that Christina Harold and TDS exercised
over Myers's choreography. Harold testified that she made the ""last decision"" about dances that TDS students could
perform:

Q: And you didn't control what she was doing in connection with that choreography, correct?

A: Well, | do control it, yes. | mean, it's up to me to say yes or no.

Q: Yes or no to what?

A: If the choreography is acceptable. | make the last decision.

Q: So basically what you mean by that is if there were something that might be a little bit too provocative or music
that would be R rated, you would say we can't use that for the recital?

A: Yes.

(Harold Dep. 51:8-19.) Harold acknowledged that she could not recall any instance in which she disapproved choreography
prepared by Myers or any other TDS dance instructor. ( /d. at 51:20-24, 53:1-13.) Nevertheless, it was Harold, Defendants

[279 F.Supp.3d 784]


--- Page 3 ---
assert, who determined the type of dance to be choreographed (such as tap, jazz, lyrical, ballet, or hip hop), and the ages
and skill levels of the students who would perform the dance. (Defs.' Resp. to PSOF 4 46.)

Other circumstances regarding Myers's and TDS's working relationship are disputed, as well. Myers received a W-2 for
2012, but Defendants issued a 1099—MISC for 2013, 2014, and 2015. (PSOF § 28.) For 2013, 2014, and 2015, TDS neither
withheld taxes from Myers's checks nor provided her with benefits. ( /d. at § 30.) Harold assigned the classes each instructor
would teach, based on the instructor's availability, strengths, weaknesses, and teaching preferences. (Defs.' Joint L.R.
56.1(b) Statement of Additional Material Facts Opposing PI.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (""DSOAF"") [57] { 13.) When a dance
teacher was unavailable for a class, unless Harold could find another TDS instructor to cover the class, the teacher
him/herself was obligated to find a substitute, subject to Harold's approval. (Second Decl. of Tina Harold, Ex. A to Defs.'
App. in Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J. [58-1 at p. 1] § 26.) Harold paid the teachers, including substitute teachers, directly ( id.
), and TDS students paid TDS and Harold; that is, dance students did not pay instructors directly. (Defs.' Resp. to PSOAF
85.)

TDS follows a ""dance season"" that corresponds with the academic year. (DSOF 7.) The season culminates in a ""Spring
Recital,"" at which TDS students perform dances for their families and friends. (Defs.' Resp. to PSOF 7; Pl.'s Resp. to
DSOF 8.) Myers acknowledged that she understood while she was teaching dance routines that those routines would be
performed at TDS recitals. (Myers Dep. 71:8-17.) Ryan Brandt, another instructor at TDS, averred that TDS instructors
expected that their choreography would be performed by TDS students at various events. (DSOF 43.) Neither Brandt nor
Myers states whether they expected that to continue after they left TDS; Myers was not asked this question, and Brandt was
not deposed (nor is it clear that Brandt's testimony would be relevant to Myers's expectations and relationship with TDS).

Il. Final Cut Dance Company

In fall 2012, TDS formed a dance competition team known as ""Final Cut Dance Company"" (""FCDC""). (DSOF ¢ 16; PSOF 4
22.) For the 2014-15 dance year, the only dance year at issue, Myers taught TDS classes only to students who were FCDC
participants (Pl.'s Resp. to DSOF § 17; PSOF 4 24); Defendants believe that Myers should therefore have expected that
students would perform her dances at FCDC competitions.

Myers created a document entitled ""Final Cut Dance Company Contract Agreement"" (""FCDC Contract"") for students who
wanted to compete on the team. § (Myers Dep. 75:16-76:11.) Defendants rely heavily on this ""agreement,"" so the court
devotes some attention to it here; but, as explained below, this commitment by the students to the dance studio has minimal
relevance in the dispute between Myers and Defendants. Both the student and his or her parent were required to sign the
document, but no one from TDS countersigned it. (Ex. A to Ex. G to DSOF (""FCDC Contract"") [53-1 at p. 68].) 7The
document lists a number of ""guidelines and regulations"" for students: they were required

[279 F.Supp.3d 785]

to attend all classes and practices with a limited number of absences; participate in fundraising events; wear appropriate
attire; and refrain from participation in any other dance team or class. ( /d. ) The document also describes required fees: an
annual registration fee, a fee for each class, costume fees, and competition entry fees. ( /d. ) Students committed to perform
dances in four competitions ""as well as various performances throughout the dance year,"" and to ""participate in a team
production dance at every competition."" ( /d. ) A student who expected to be absent or late was required to call Myers. ( /d. )
Myers expected to remove dancers from the FCDC team if they did not abide by the conditions; any student removed from
the FCDC team remained eligible to ""participate in those dances"" at the TDS school-wide recitals, but not to compete with
the team. ( See Myers Dep. 75:16-76:4.)

Harold averred that the FCDC Contract ""included a provision permitting FCDC participants to perform the dances they
learned throughout the dance year, so long as they did not compete with other teams[.]"" (Harold Decl. { 12-13; see DSOF
432.) In fact, however, the FCDC Contract contains no such provision; while the Contract prohibits students from
performing with other dance teams, no provision of the FCDC Contract makes any reference to the specific dances, let
alone any reference to permission to perform choreographed works.

Defendants now insist that the FCDC was a contract binding on Myers, though their position on this issue has evolved.
Harold initially testified that there was no written agreement between TDS and Myers (other than the terms in the Craigslist
ad). (Harold Dep. 38:23-40:13, 100:13-22.) After her deposition, however, she claimed that TDS was a party to the FCDC
Contract, in which TDS was paid ""in exchange for providing all facilities necessary to effectuate the purpose of the
Agreement."" (Harold Decl. 4 20, 30; see DSOAF § 11.) Defendants point to the beginning of the FCDC Contract, which
they contend shows Myers's agreement to provide services:

My commitment to all of my dancers is to teach and to guide you into becoming an outstanding, reliable, and
trustworthy team member. You are part of a team, and without your commitment, we cannot be all we want to be!
It is a commitment not only for each dancer, but to the team.

lam very excited to see what the 2014-2015 year has in store for our team members. In the next pages, you will
need to read all of the guidelines and regulations you need to know to be a loyal asset to our team.

(FCDC Contract.) Defendants further claim that Myers has acknowledged she was a party to the FCDC Contract,
emphasizing Myers's testimony that the FCDC Contract


--- Page 4 ---
was between me, Tina, or The Dance Shop, and the parents and students just to make sure that we had
everything in place [and] in order, there's no drama about what the rules are, who pays what, and just basically it
tells everything about the whole season and what to expect.

(Myers Dep. 76:12-18.) This testimony does not, however, support the notion that Myers and TDS exchanged mutual
promises in the ""contract;"" instead, it refers to the students' and parents' commitment to both TDS and Myers. In any event,
Myers's testimony about this document is not admissible to establish its content or legal effect. FED. R. EVID . 1002. 8

[279 F.Supp.3d 786]
Ill. The Choreographed Dances

On February 25, 2015, Myers resigned her position as a dance instructor at TDS. (PSOF 4 51; DSOF 4 34.) This dispute
centers on whether Myers owns the copyright to five dances she claims to have choreographed prior to that date. The
dances at issue are known as Desperate Housewives , Guts & Glory , Piece Choreographed to the Song ""Baby I'm a Star"" (""
Baby I'm a Star""), Music Box Dancer , and Turn Down for What. (PI.'s Resp. to DSOF 4 3; Defs.' Resp. to PSOF § 35.)
Plaintiff asserts that ""[flor the dance season of 2014-2015, Myers created, independently, wholly original dance
choreography for dances while an independent contractor at The Dance Shop."" (PSOF § 35.) Defendants object to this
statement as containing a number of legal conclusions, and they admit only that Plaintiff testified that she choreographed the
dances in question. (Defs.' Resp. to PSOF § 35.) Yet, as discussed below, it is undisputed that Plaintiff choreographed at
least some of these dances. 2

Defendants effectively concede that Myers choreographed Desperate Housewives and Guts & Glory : they admit not only
that Myers testified that she choreographed these dances, but also that the two dances were in fact ""created by Myers""
before February 25, 2015. 12(Defs.' Resp. to PSOF {{ 36-37, 40.) The program for the 2015 TDS recital (three months after
Myers's resignation) lists Myers as sole choreographer for each of these two dances. (Ex. 11 to Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot.
for Summ. J. (""Recital Program"") [37—11].) It is therefore undisputed that Myers choreographed these two dances before she
left TDS.

Baby I'm a Star presents different circumstances. The 2015 TDS recital program lists both Myers and another dance
teacher, Ryan Brandt, as choreographers of this dance (Recital Program), but Defendants admit that Baby I'm a Star was
""created by Myers"" ( id. at § 37), so there is no genuine dispute about whether Myers choreographed the dance. Instead,
Defendants dispute that Baby I'm a Star was fixed in a tangible medium (that is, recorded on video) before Myers left TDS,
and argue that this dance is therefore ineligible for copyright protection under 17 U.S.C. § 102. (DSOF { 48; Defs.' Resp. to
PSOF 4 36.)

Myers responded by submitting a video that she claims was made on November 5, 2014 (before Myers left TDS) and shows
dancers performing Baby I'm a Star. (Ex. A to Ex. 4 to Pl.'s Resp. to DSOF [55-6].) The video, submitted as part of the
summary judgment record, does show part of a dance, and was recorded on November 5, 2014. ( See id.) Defendants
object to consideration of this video on the ground that it was not produced in response to a discovery request for all such
videos, and because it is less than 30 seconds long. (Defs.' Resp. to PSOAF 4 104—06.)

[279 F.Supp.3d 787]

Myers's failure to produce the video in discovery is disappointing, but this appears to be a function of oversight, not bad
faith. +. At the court's request (Order, Apr. 19, 2017 [66] ), Myers produced a video which shows the dance in its entirety. (
See Decl. of David S. Becker [67].) Having reviewed the second video, the court concludes (1) that the initial video provided
to the court is in fact an excerpt of the second, longer video, and (2) that the dance being performed on the November 5,
2014 video is largely identical to the dance performed in the TDS recital video, which Defendants admit shows Baby I'm a
Star. (See DSOF { 48.) The court therefore finds that Baby I'm a Star was fixed in a tangible medium on November 5, 2014.
Defendants do not contest any other fact relating to the choreography of Baby I'm a Star. There is therefore no genuine
dispute that Myers choreographed Baby I'm a Star before she left TDS.

The fourth dance at issue here is Music Box Dancer. Myers initially claimed to have choreographed that entire dance, though
she now claims to have choreographed 85% of it. 12(Pl.'s Resp. to DSOF 9 45, 52.) Defendants dispute this, citing the
declaration of a parent of one of the students who performed it; without providing the source of her knowledge of the issue,
the parent claims that Myers choreographed only thirty to forty seconds of the two-to-three-minute dance. (Decl. of Nicole
Connell, Ex. H to DSOF [53-1 at p. 78] § 33.) According to this parent, another TDS dance instructor, Ryan Brandt,
choreographed the rest of Music Box Dancer. ( Id. at 4 34.) Though she is listed as a co-choreographer of Music Box Dancer
in the recital program (Recital Program), Brandt's own declaration in this case makes no mention of that dance. ( See
generally Decl. of Ryan Brandt, Ex. E to DSOF [53-1 at p. 58].) There is thus minimal support for the contention that anyone
other than Myers choreographed Music Box Dancer. Cf. 17 U.S.C. § 101 (for a work to be a ""joint work,"" authors must
""inten[d] that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole""); Ty, Inc. v.
Publications Int'l, Ltd. . 333 F.Supp.2d 705 , 712 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (""[A] work is not considered transformative if it serves the
same purpose as plaintiff's original or derivative works.""). Myers has not moved for summary judgment regarding this dance,
and Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on whether Myers's status as its choreographer.



--- Page 5 ---
As for Turn Down for What, there is little evidence in the record regarding who choreographed that dance. Myers has not
moved for summary judgment on her claim of infringement of this dance, and did not testify about it in her deposition. It was
not performed at the TDS recital, and is not mentioned in the recital program. Without any such evidence, the court cannot
determine who choreographed Turn Down for What.

During the weeks after she left TDS, Myers sent Harold three text messages asking that TDS stop using her choreography.
(Ex. 7 to Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. [37—7].) Myers and Harold had never discussed ownership of the
choreography that Myers created for her dance classes until Myers stopped teaching at

[279 F.Supp.3d 788]

TDS. (PSOF 17.) 18Defendants claim that after Myers left TDS, ""FCDC was unable to compete in any performances
during the 2014-2015 dance season."" 14(DSOF { 40.) Myers disputes this fact, but cites only to non-competitive shows in
which FCDC members later performed. (PI.'s Resp. to DSOF § 40.) Myers admits, however, that she told parents of FCDC
students—the court does not know how or when she contacted them—that they could not use her choreography in
competitions. ( /d. at | 44.)

IV. The Allegedly Infringing Performances

On May 30 and 31, 2015, TDS held a recital, for which it charged $15 per seat. (PSOF 4 61-62.) TDS also sold pre-orders
of DVDs of the recital for $25 each (presumably people paid in advance for a DVD copy of the video that was recorded at
the recital). ( /d. at § 62.) At each night of the recital, TDS students performed Baby I'm a Star , Music Box Dancer ,
Desperate Housewives , and Guts & Glory. (DSOF 4 49.) The recital program lists Amanda Myers as the choreographer of
Desperate Housewives and Guts & Glory , and Amanda Myers and Ryan Brandt as the choreographers of Baby I'm a Star15
and Music Box Dancer. (Recital Program.) The program also listed ""directors"" of each of the dances. ( Id. ) Defendants
acknowledges that directors were not choreographers, but instead helped TDS students practice the dances. (PSOF { 68.)
The costumes and sets used for the recital differed from those in the videos that Myers had recorded; for example, Myers's
videos showed the dancers in a dance studio wearing athletic gear, while in the recital they were on a stage wearing
leotards and dresses. (DSOAF 9 27-30.)

On June 20, 2015, TDS students performed Music Box Dancer and Turn Down for What at a talent show called ""Alsip's Got
Talent."" (DSOF § 51.) Defendants claim that they did not know these students would perform at Alsip's Got Talent, but
Plaintiff contends that Defendants helped the students prepare for the performance. (PI.'s Resp. to DSOF 4 54.) On July 4,
2015, TDS students performed Guts & Glory at another talent show, ""Oak Lawn's Got Talent."" (DSOF {§ 58-59.)
Defendants claim that Harold did not learn that the performance was planned until after the students had registered, citing
the declaration of a parent of one of the students. For her part, without offering specifics, Myers asserts she ""personally
witnessed public admissions made by Defendants that The Dance Shop was fully behind the performance"" and that she saw
TDS's post about it on Facebook. (Pl.'s Resp. to DSOF § 62; Decl. of Amanda Myers, Ex. 4 to Pl.'s Resp. to DSOF [55-5]

[279 F.Supp.3d 789]

31-32.) Myers admits, however, that TDS did not help the students prepare for this performance. (PI.'s Resp. to DSOF 4
64.)

On July 27, 2015, TDS students performed Desperate Housewives and Music Box Dancer at a summer festival called
""Ridgefest."" (DSOF §§ 68-69.) Harold had arranged this performance, which Defendants claim was to satisfy FCDC.
students who were upset that they had not competed in dance competitions that year. ( /d. at § 73; see id. {§ 71-72.)

V. The Instant Lawsuit

On August 17, 2015, Myers applied to register Desperate Housewives , Guts & Glory , and Baby I'm a Star with the United
States Copyright Office, and the Copyright Offices issued certificates of registration. 12( See PSOF § 49; Ex. 8-10 to Pl.'s
Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. [37-8], [37-9], [37—10].) On August 24, 2015, Myers filed this lawsuit, alleging direct
copyright infringement for the performances at the recital (Count |), contributory copyright infringement for the performances
at the summer talent shows (Count II), and unjust enrichment (Count III). Defendants pleaded seven affirmative defenses:
(1) failure to state a claim; (2) unclean hands; (3) waiver; (4) after-acquired evidence; (5) unjust enrichment (apparently on
the theory that Myers was already compensated for her choreography); (6) work-for-hire; and (7) ""the Fair Use Doctrine,
including but not limited to the First Sale Doctrine and/or Joint Works of Authorship Doctrine."" (Defs.' Joint Am. Answer [33].)
Defendant has moved for summary judgment on all counts. Plaintiff has moved for summary judgment on its direct
infringement with respect to the recital performances 180f Desperate Housewives , Guts & Glory , and Baby I'm a Star , and
on Defendant's affirmative defenses.

|. Direct Copyright Infringement
Subject to limited exceptions, such as fair use, the owner of a copyrighted
[279 F.Supp.3d 790]

choreographic work has the exclusive right to perform the work publicly, distribute copies of the work, and prepare derivative
works based on the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 106 ; see 17 U.S.C. § 107. Defendants performed at least some of the
dances publicly at the spring recital, by organizing the recital, charging admission, and selling DVDs of the recital. 17 U.S.C.
§ 101 ; see Flava Works, Inc. v. Gunter , 689 F.3d 754 , 760 (7th Cir. 2012) ; cf. Lodge Hall Music, Inc. v. Waco Wrangler
Club, Inc. , 831 F.2d 77 , 78 (5th Cir. 1987) ; Broad.Music, Inc. v. Prana Hosp., Inc. , 158 F.Supp.3d 184, 192 (S.D.N.Y.
2016). Defendants do not dispute this; instead, they dispute that Plaintiff owns the copyright to the dances, or alternatively,
contend that Plaintiff granted Defendants a license to perform them.

Defendants’ challenge to Myers's claim of ownership of the copyright rests on two arguments: that one of the dances was
not fixed in a tangible medium, and that all of the dances were works made for hire. The first argument need not detain the
court: Defendants argue that Plaintiff does not own the copyright to Baby I'm a Star because Plaintiff has not proved that it
was fixed in a tangible medium before the recital, but the videos that Plaintiff has produced to the court defeat that
contention. They show that Myers choreographed Baby I'm a Star before she left TDS. Notably, Defendants do not move for
summary judgment on the grounds that Myers did not choreograph Music Box Dancer and Turn Down for What —indeed, in
their memorandum in support of summary judgment, Defendants admit that Plaintiff ""created"" Music Box Dancer and Turn
Down for What. ( see Defs.' Joint Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (""Defs.' Mem."") [52] 11.) Defendants are not entitled to
summary judgment on the grounds that Myers did not choreograph the dances. 12

A. Work Made for Hire

Defendants also argue that Plaintiff does not own the copyrights to the other dances because the dances were works made
for hire. A work is made for hire if it is:

(1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or

(2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion
picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional
text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument
signed by

[279 F.Supp.3d 791]
them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire....

17 U.S.C. § 101. Defendants argue both that Plaintiff was an employee and that Defendants commissioned the dances in a
written instrument, that is, the FCDC Contract. Plaintiff responds that Myers was an independent contractor, not an
employee, and the FCDC Contract was not an express work-for-hire agreement.

1. Work Prepared by an Employee

The Supreme Court has set forth a non-exhaustive factor test to determine whether a creator of a copyrighted work is an
employee; the factors include:

the hiring party's right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished[;] .... the skill
required; the source of the instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the duration of the relationship
between the parties; whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party; the
extent of the hired party's discretion over when and how long to work; the method of payment; the hired party's
role in hiring and paying assistants; whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party; whether
the hiring party is in business; the provision of employee benefits; and the tax treatment of the hired party.

Cmty. for Creative Non—Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 , 751-52, 109 S.Ct. 2166 , 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989) . Myers
analogizes to_Natkin v. Winfrey, 111 F.Supp.2d 1003 , 1006 (N.D. Ill. 2000), a case that, while not binding, is particularly
instructive in applying the Reid test. The defendants paid the plaintiffs, two professional photographers, to photograph the
host and guests who appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Id. Both plaintiffs used their own equipment and processed
their own film, but they ""had no control over the position or appearance of their subjects ..., the layout and design of the
sets, or even the lighting of the set[.]"" /d. The photographers did, however, have ""complete discretion over the technical
aspects of the shoot: they chose which cameras, lenses, and film to use; the appropriate shutter speed, aperture settings,
and timing for the shots; and how to frame the images."" /d. The photographers billed the defendants a flat fee for each show
they photographed; the defendants did not withhold taxes or provide benefits, and they reported the payments on 1099



--- Page 7 ---
forms (not W-2 forms). /d. at 1006-07. The plaintiffs were referred to as ""staff photographers,"" and received paid parking,
access to the employee cafeteria, and invitations to staff functions. /d. at 1007. On occasions when the photographers were
unable to photograph the show themselves, they would hire and pay a substitute, for which the defendants would reimburse
them. /d.

Applying the Reid factors, the district court found no genuine dispute about the photographers' status as independent
contractors, not employees. /d. at 1008-10. The court identified as ""most important[ ]"" the fact that ""neither photographer
was ever treated like an employee in terms of compensation, benefits, and taxes."" /d. at 1008-09. The court also observed
that ""[b]oth men were highly skilled professionals specializing in live-action photography; both used (and insured) their own
equipment; and both exercised discretion in hiring substitute photographers when they themselves were unavailable and
paid those substitutes."" /d. at 1008. As to the degree of control, the court noted that ""all of the parties exercised control over
the manner and means of production to some extent[,]"" but because the plaintiffs controlled the technical aspects of the
photographs and the ultimate image, that factor weighed in the plaintiffs’ favor. /d. at 1009.

[279 F.Supp.3d 792]

Some factors did weigh in favor of the defendants: the studio was a business; 22the photographers had worked with the
studio for a long period of time; they were referred to as ""staff photographers;"" and the defendants controlled the location
and timing of the work. /d. at 1009. Whether making the photographs was part of the defendants' regular business was
disputed, but even resolving this factor in the defendants’ favor, all factors that favored the plaintiffs had greater weight. /d. at
1009-10. The court emphasized the defendants’ tax treatment of plaintiffs and observed that ""[the defendants] may not
obtain the benefits associated with hiring an independent contractor and, at the same time, enjoy the advantages of treating
that person as an employee; [they] must choose."" /d. at 1009 ; accord, Aymes v. Bonelli, 980 F.2d 857 , 862 (2d Cir. 1992)
(although the defendant ""had the right to control the manner in which [the copyrighted work] was created[,]"" the defendant's
failure to give the plaintiff ""any employment benefits or to pay any of his payroll taxes [wa]s highly indicative that [the
plaintiff] was considered an outside independent contractor""; defendant ""should not in one context be able to claim that [the
plaintiff] was an independent contractor and ... later deny him that status to avoid a copyright infringement suit."").

This case is similar. TDS issued 1099 forms to Myers for 2013, 2014, and 2015, listing her earnings as ""non-employee
compensation."" TDS did not withhold taxes, nor did it give Myers any benefits. Although TDS controlled the type of dance
(such as jazz, tap, or lyrical), set the time and location of the dance class, and retained the final decision-making authority
about whether TDS students would perform the dances at the recital, there is no evidence that TDS or Harold exercised any
creative or technical control over the choreography. Thus, all of the factors that the Natkin court considered most important
weigh in favor of Myers.

Defendants point out that, unlike the plaintiffs in Natkin , who never received W—2s, Myers received a W-2 in 2012 and her
""job duties at TDS remained constant"" in the following years. (Defs.' Joint Mem. Opposing PI.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (""Defs.'
Resp."") [59] 5.) But this militates in favor of Myers, as it reflects TDS's conscious choice to change the compensation model
and reap the benefits of the independent contractor tax treatment. Defendants assert that it was Myers herself who
requested issuance of a 1099 (DSOAF f 7); if true, this does not change the fact that TDS agreed to the request. As the
Natkin court pointed out, employers cannot abandon their choice of the tax treatment of workers after the fact.

Defendants also argue that there is a dispute over how much control each party exercised. As Natkin demonstrates,
however, the appropriate focus is on the control of the creative aspect of the dance—the copyrighted material itself—into
which TDS had essentially no input. The dance routines were refined when students tried them out during class, as
Defendants emphasize; but it was Myers, not Harold or anyone else, who made the refinements. That TDS provided the
facilities and students for Myers's choreography also does not change the outcome; in Natkin, the fact that the defendants
controlled the studio and the photographed subjects was comparatively unimportant.

Defendants highlight other factors, also present in Natkin : that TDS is ""in business""
[279 F.Supp.3d 793]

and that it had a lengthy relationship with Myers. Neither of these circumstances tipped the balance in Natkin , and they do
not tip the balance here, either. Although Myers was paid hourly (a pay structure common to employees rather than
contractors), there is evidence that the bulk of the choreography work was performed during hours for which she was not
paid at all. The fact that Harold, not Myers, would sometimes find substitute instructors also does not overcome the
substantial factors that weigh in Myers's favor. The only notable differences between Natkin and this case are that
Defendants claim that TDS assigned Myers additional projects, such as teaching additional dance routines for charity
events, and that the plaintiffs in Natkin , unlike Myers, had their own companies which billed the defendants. Neither of these
facts can overcome Myers's substantial creative control over her choreography.

Finally, Defendants argue that Myers's choreographing and teaching dance was part of TDS's regular business. While
teaching dance is integral to the business of a dance school, the record does not satisfy the court that this is equally true of
choreography—Myers could have taught dances choreographed by others. TDS could obtain the rights to various dances
via a license. Further, the court in Natkin found that ""[e]ven assuming this factor weighs in favor of the defendants' position,""
it did not outweigh the pay, tax, and benefits treatment of the plaintiffs, and the fact that the plaintiffs used their own creative



--- Page 8 ---
judgment and expertise in creating the photographs. Natkin._111 F.Supp.2d at 1010 . There is no genuine dispute that
Myers was an independent contractor.

2. Work Specially Ordered or Commissioned

Even if Myers is an independent contractor, Defendant argues, the choreography is a work made for hire if it was specifically
commissioned pursuant to a written agreement. That test is met here, Defendants assert, in the FCDC Contract. Again, the
court disagrees. To be a work made for hire, the parties must ""expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that
the work shall be considered a work made for hire."" 17 U.S.C. § 101. The only parties who signed the FCDC Contract were
the students and parents, and it was apparently intended to communicate requirements on the part of the dancers. Neither
Myers nor Harold actually signed it, as required by the copyright statute. See Schiller & Schmidt, Inc. v. Nordisco Corp. . 969
F.2d 410 , 412 (7th Cir. 1992) (""The statutory language is 'signed by them,' that is, by both parties, and it means what it
says."") (internal citation omitted).

More importantly, the FCDC Contract says nothing about commissioning works and makes no express reference to
choreography. The statute requires that the parties ""expressly"" agree that the work is made for hire. What matters for the
purpose of the requirement is the language of the document. See Warren v. Fox Family Worldwide. Inc. , 328 F.3d 1136 ,
1142 (9th Cir. 2003). The document does not say that Myers will create choreography, and her testimony that she taught
dance routines to students does not convert a commitment by those students into a commission agreement between TDS
and Myers.

Defendants characterize the FCDC Contract as committing Plaintiff ""to creating and teaching dances to students[,]"" (Defs.'
Mem. 6), but it simply does not say that. At most, Plaintiff commits ""to teach and to guide"" the students, but that does not
necessarily include choreography, nor does it include any commitment to TDS itself. Defendants claim that the fact that the
students themselves took on various obligations

[279 F.Supp.3d 794]

in the FCDC Contract and paid fees for the classes at which they learned the choreography (DSOF {§ 46-47, 57, 60, 70),
creates a dispute over whether the dances were works made for hire, but any obligations the agreement may have imposed
on students says nothing about any ""express"" agreement between TDS and Myers. Moreover, even if the FCDC Contract
assumed that Myers would choreograph dances, it would not constitute an agreement that the choreography was a work
made for hire or that Defendants would own the copyright. Summary judgment is granted for Myers on the work-made-for-
hire issue.

B. License

Next, Defendants argue that they had a license to use the choreographed works; they claim they had an express license
through the FCDC Contract, or, in the alternative, an implied license. Plaintiff responds that license is an affirmative defense,
which Defendants forfeited because they did not raise it in their answer. See FED. R. CIV. P. 8(c). Generally, ""[t]he failure to
plead an affirmative defense in the answer works a forfeiture only if the plaintiff is harmed by the defendant's delay in
asserting it."" Garofalo v. Vill. of Hazel Crest , 754 F.3d 428 , 436 (7th Cir. 2014) (alteration in original) (internal citation and
quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff responded to Defendants’ license arguments in their response to Defendants’ summary
judgment motion, and their reply in favor of their own motion. Because Plaintiff was able to respond, the court will address
this defense. /d. at 437 (no prejudice when opposing party had opportunity to respond in summary judgment brief).

1. Express License

Defendants claim that the FCDC is an express, exclusive license. An express, exclusive license is a transfer of copyright
ownership, which must be ""an instrument of conveyance, or a note or memorandum of the transfer ... in writing and signed
by the owner of the rights conveyed[.]"" 17 U.S.C. § 101, 204(a) ; see .A.E., Inc. v. Shaver , 74 F.3d 768 , 774 (7th Cir.
1996). An express license agreement need not contain the word ""copyright,"" see /TOFCA, Inc. v. MegaTrans Logistics, Inc. ,
322 F.3d 928 , 931 (7th Cir. 2003), but it must express intent to transfer copyright.S.A.M. Elecs.. Inc. v. Osaraprasop . 39
F.Supp.2d 1074 , 1080 (N.D. Ill. 1999) (citing Schiller & Schmidt_._969 F.2d at 413 ); see Marya v. Warner/Chappell Music,
Inc. , 131 F.Supp.3d 975, 1000 (C.D. Cal. 2015) (no license when ""Defendants cannot point to any particular evidence that
would show us the intent of contracting parties[.]""); Woods v. Resnick , 725 F.Supp.2d 809 , 826 (W.D. Wis. 2010) (""[A]
particular writing must reflect a clear and equivocal intention on the part of the copyright owner to transfer ownership."")

(internal citation and quotation marks omitted); Foraste v. Brown Univ. , 290 F.Supp.2d 234 , 240 (D.R.1. 2003) (collecting
cases). This argument meets the same fate as Defendants’ work-for-hire argument. Regardless of Myers's testimony, an
express license requires a signed contract, and she did not sign the FCDC Contract.

Nor is the FCDC Contract a ""memorandum of the transfer."" As explained above, the document itself says nothing about
choreography. The intent to transfer is not evident from the face of the document. See Woods__ 725 F.Supp.2d at 826 (no

transfer when the written agreement referred to copyrights, but was not explicitly a transfer of rights); Foraste_, 290
E.Supp.2d at 240 (no transfer when the document ""fails to make any reference at all to the subject matter of the rights to be
transferred, the recipient of the transferred rights, the timing of the transfer, or any other particulars of the deal."");

[279 F.Supp.3d 795]


--- Page 9 ---
Pamtiloff v. Giant Records, Inc. , 794 F.Supp. 933 , 936 (N.D. Cal. 1992) (no transfer when the agreement ""makes no
reference to publishing rights or rights to musical compositions."").

As with the work-made-for-hire argument, the fact that the students themselves undertook obligations in the FCDC Contract
makes no difference. There is reason to doubt that this document—a memorialization of the dance studio's expectations of
the students—was a valid contract at all (if students missed rehearsal, would TDS have sued them for breach?). But
assuming the FCDC Contract is an agreement, it is one between the students and their parents on one side, and TDS and
Myers on the other; it cannot be characterized as an agreement between Myers and TDS. There is no genuine dispute about
whether Myers granted an express license, and summary judgment is granted to Myers on that issue.

2. Implied License

Next, Defendants argue that Myers gave Defendants a non-exclusive implied license to perform the choreographed works at
the recital and the summer performances. Plaintiff responds that even if there was an implied license, it was revocable, and
Myers revoked it when she texted Harold and told her not to use the choreography.

Defendants cite to_/.A.E.. Inc. v. Shaver, 74 F.3d 768 (7th Cir. 1996) . In/.A.E. , an architect contracted to provide schematic
drawings for a construction company for $10,000. /d. at 770. The architect anticipated that he would be the architect for the

rest of the project, as well. /d. at 771. After he delivered the drawings, however, the architect learned that he would no longer
be involved in the project, and he wrote the company that ""[w]e trust that our ideas and knowledge exhibited in our work will
assist [the company] in realizing a credible and flexible use ... facility."" /d. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The
company agreed to pay the architect's contracted price for the drawings, but when the architect later asserted rights in them,
the company successfully sued for a declaratory judgment that they were not infringing the architect's copyright. /d.

The Seventh Circuit affirmed. It agreed with the district court that, because the architect knew that the drawings would be
used for the project, and received $10,000 for preparing them, he granted an implied license. /d. at 776-77. Further, the
architect ""delivered his copyrighted designs without any warning that their further use would constitute copyright
infringement."" The court viewed the architect's letter as effectively acknowledging that the company would continue to use
the drawings even though he would not continue on the project. /d. at 777. The Seventh Circuit also approvingly cited the
Fourth Circuit's dictum that ""an implied license is ... revocable absent consideration[.]"" /d. at 775 n.10 (citing Aviec Sys., Inc.
v. Peiffer, 21 F.3d 568 , 574 n.12 (4th Cir. 1994) ).

This case is similar to /.A.E, Defendants argue. They point out that Myers testified that she knew that students would

perform dances that she taught at the recital, and one can infer that she expected that the FCDC dance team would perform
the dances at competitions as well. Also as in /.A.£. , Myers choreographed the dances without warning Harold or TDS until
after she left that unauthorized use would infringe a copyright. But unlike /.A.E. , immediately after resigning her position,
Myers told Harold not to use the dances. The fact that TDS cancelled the FCDC dance competitions is significant if it reflects
TDS's understanding that any implied license did not extend beyond the recital. Yet there is a genuine dispute about whether
that is the case, and if Myers did grant a license to TDS for the competitions themselves, it is possible that

[279 F.Supp.3d 796]

the license extended to the summer talent shows, given that the same students were performing the dances at roughly the
same time that the competitions would have occurred. The fact that Myers was at least aware that TDS planned to use
dances she had choreographed, but did not seek additional compensation for them before she resigned, could support an
implied license.

Whatever her intentions before she resigned, Myers argues that she revoked any implied license when she sent her text
messages. Whether this was an effective revocation, however, is also disputed. Law governing this issue is uncertain. Myers
points out that in Illinois, copyright licenses of indefinite duration can be terminated by either party at any time. See Walthal v.
Rusk , 172 F.3d 481 , 485 (7th Cir. 1999). Defendants point toAvtec Systems, Inc. v. Peiffer, 21 F.3d 568 , 574 n.12 (4th

Cir. 1994), cited in /.A.E. , which stated in dicta that an implied license is revocable if there is no consideration. From this
dictum, Defendants conclude that the converse is true: that an implied license is irrevocable if there is consideration. That
test, if it applies, does not support summary judgment for Defendants, however. It is not clear whether Myers received
consideration for her choreography. In /.A.E. , the parties' contract specified that the $10,000 was for creation of the
drawings, but the record here does not establish that the payments to Myers were for choreography in addition to her
teaching services.

The Illinois-based rule that Myers argues for also leaves questions unanswered. It is not clear whether any implied license in
this case really was of unspecified duration. In Walthal , the parties had a written contract that had no term, and did not
identify circumstances under which the contract would end. 172 F.3d at 482 . Here, however, the facts could support a
finding that Defendants had an implied license to use Myers's choreography for a single dance season: a new dance season
began every school year, after which participants were required to sign up for classes again and pay new fees, and a new
FCDC dance team was selected. Myers testified that she expected that students would perform her dances at the recital,
meaning that whether the contract was of unspecified duration is disputed. Under either side's proposed rule, there is a
dispute about whether the license was revocable.


--- Page 10 ---
In sum, there are genuine disputes about whether Myers granted TDS an implied license, the scope of any such license, and
whether that license was revoked. Summary judgment is therefore denied on the issue of an implied license.

Il. Contributory Copyright Infringement

Defendants also move for summary judgment on Count II, contributory copyright infringement. ""Liability for contributory
infringement will be imposed when a defendant, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially
contributes to the infringing conduct of another."" Marobie—FL, Inc. v. Nat'l Ass'n of Fire Equip. Distributors, 983 F.Supp.
1167 , 1178 (N.D. Ill. 1997) ;see Metro—Goldwyn—Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913 , 930, 125 S.Ct. 2764
, 162 L.Ed.2d 781 (2005) . Plaintiff alleges that Defendants contributorily infringed by assisting TDS students in performing
at the summer talent shows. Defendants do not dispute that TDS students performed Myers's choreography at the three
summer talent shows. Instead, Defendants argue that Plaintiff is unable to prove either knowledge or material inducement.
The court finds that there is a genuine dispute of material fact whether Defendants had knowledge of the students’ infringing
activity, so it need not reach the material inducement issue.

[279 F.Supp.3d 797]

In support of their claim that they lacked knowledge, Defendants rely on Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line
Communication Services, Inc., 907 F.Supp. 1361 (N.D. Cal. 1995) , 2! but that case, if anything, supports Plaintiff's position
on this issue. There, the plaintiff notified the defendant, an Internet service provider, that an individual was posting allegedly
infringing material—writings by L. Ron Hubbard—on the Internet through its system. /d. at 1373. The court denied summary
judgment for the defendant, explaining that the defendant's knowledge was sufficiently disputed, because ""[a]lthough a mere
unsupported allegation of infringement by a copyright owner may not automatically put a defendant on notice of infringing
activity, [the defendant's] position that liability must be unequivocal is unsupportable."" /d. at 1374. The court found that
because the works contained copyright notices, ""it is difficult to argue that a defendant did not know that the works were
copyrighted[,]"" but denied summary judgment because there was ""at least a colorable claim of fair use."" /d.

Defendants believe that they had even less notice than the defendants in Religious Technology Center , because Myers had
not yet applied for copyright registration at the time of the performances. But Defendants arguably had even more notice
than the defendants in Religious Technology Center , because Defendants knew that Myers had choreographed at least
some of the dances at issue. Defendants again invoke the FCDC Contract in support of their claim of fair use, but that
document does not support a defense for the reasons set forth above. Indeed, all of Defendants’ ""lack of knowledge""
argument is directed at knowledge of Myers's claimed copyright; Defendants do not claim that they did not know of the
infringing activity—that TDS students performed at the summer talent shows—and Defendants had knowledge of at least
some of these performances. Summary judgment is denied on Count Il.

Ill. Unjust Enrichment

Defendants have two arguments for summary judgment on Count Ill. First, Defendants point out that Myers may not recover
for unjust enrichment when ""an actual contract governs the parties' relation on that issue."" Keck Garrett & Assocs., Inc. v.
Nextel Comme'ns, Inc., 517 F.3d 476 , 487 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing Illinois exrel. Hartigan v. E & E Hauling, Inc._, 153 llI.2d 473
, 497, 180 Ill.Dec. 271 , 607 N.E.2d 165 , 177 (1992) ). But the most that Myers ""promises"" under the document is to ""teach
and guide"" students, which is a commitment to the students, not to Harold or TDS.

Second, Defendant argues that ""Plaintiff has no copyright claim to the choreographic works to begin with, and therefore
cannot claim she has been unjustly enriched."" (Defs.' Mem. 19.) As explained above, there is at least a genuine dispute as
to

[279 F.Supp.3d 798]
Plaintiff's copyright claims. Summary judgment is denied with respect to Plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim.
IV. Affirmative Defenses

Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment on all of Defendants' affirmative defenses. Plaintiff served Defendants with
interrogatories, asking Defendants to identify the evidence supporting the affirmative defenses; Plaintiff now contends that
the evidence supporting those affirmative defenses is insufficient to survive summary judgment. (PI.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot.
for Summ. J. (""Pl.'s Mem."") [37] 15-16.) Defendants argue that all they must do is satisfy Rule 8(c) and characterize
Plaintiff's argument as a ""discovery dispute."" (Defs.' Resp. 16-17.) This misstates the standard; at summary judgment,
efendants must provide evidence supporting these affirmative defenses. See Wilson v. Sundstrand Corp. , No. 99 C 6944,
003 WL 21961359, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 18, 2003) (""A party may properly seek summary judgment [on an affirmative
lefense] by essentially throwing the ball into the court of the party with the burden of proof.""). ""[T]he basic concept of an
firmative defense is an admission of the facts alleged in the complaint, coupled with the assertion of some other reason
defendant is not liable."" /nstituto Nacional De Comercializacion Agricola (Indeca) v. Cont'l Illinois Nat. Bank & Trust Co.__576
F.Supp. 985 , 988 (N.D. Ill. 1983) ;see also Bell, 827 F.3d at 704 .

lw)

@ an

A. Affirmative Defense 1


--- Page 11 ---
Defendant's first affirmative defense is that the complaint ""fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action."" (Joint

Am. Answer.) Assuming this can be raised as an affirmative defense at all, see Mandel Metals, Inc. v. Walker Grp. Holdings ,
No. 14 CV 8493, 2015 WL 3962005, at *10 (N.D. Ill. June 26, 2015), here it simply reiterates Defendants' arguments that
Plaintiff does not meet the elements of the claims. These arguments are more properly addressed as part of Plaintiff's case
in chief, and the court strikes the first affirmative defense as redundant pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 12(f).

B. Affirmative Defense 2

As asecond affirmative defense. Defendants allege that Myers has unclean hands. Unclean hands is an equitable defense
that precludes a judgment that would ""encourage or reward criminal or other unlawful activity."" Sch/ueter v. Latek , 683 F.3d
350 , 355 (7th Cir. 2012). As allegedly improper behavior by Myers, Defendants list tortious interference, extortion, and the
filing of a frivolous lawsuit. (Defs.' Resp. 19; see PI.'s Mem. 17.) Defendants do not explain how Myers has interfered with
Defendants’ business, however, nor do they even state the elements of extortion. Defendants' suggestion that Myers's suit is
frivolous obviously fails, as some of her claims are not only colorable, but merit summary judgment.

Defendants warn that ""an award for Plaintiff would mean that every single dance studio teacher across the country who
wishes s/he were being paid more could simply quit working shortly before their students’ dance recital, and use the threat
of costly copyright litigation and six-figure statutory damages to increase their paychecks or bolster their own clientele[.]""
(Defs.' Resp. 19.) The court does not share the assumption that all dance teachers are also choreographers. Nor does
Plaintiff's pursuit of statutory rights constitute unclean hands. As Plaintiff notes, Defendants could have avoided this situation
by documenting who would own the copyright over Myers's choreography. Summary judgment is granted on the second
affirmative defense.

[279 F.Supp.3d 799]
C. Affirmative Defense 3

Defendants' third affirmative defense is waiver. The waiver doctrine acknowledges that a right may be ""taken away from its
holder as a penalty for failure to assert it in a clear and timely manner.""_Goldman v. Gagnard , 757 F.3d 575 , 579 (7th Cir.
2014) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). But Defendants have not explained how Myers has failed to assert her
rights, nor do they address the legal requirements for a waiver defense. Instead, Defendants highlight irrelevant issues
already dispatched by the court: they claim that her claim is frivolous, that it is tortious interference, and that she has been
compensated for her choreography. Defendants’ waiver defense is stricken.

D. Affirmative Defense 4

Defendants' fourth affirmative defense invokes the after-acquired evidence doctrine. This is a rule of damages in
employment discrimination cases, see Cuff v. Trans States Holdings, Inc. , 816 F.Supp.2d 556 , 568 (N.D. Ill. 2011), and has
no relevance here. Defendants do not identify any evidence of wrongdoing by Myers that they acquired after the lawsuit was
initiated. Indeed, Defendants do not respond to Plaintiff's arguments that this defense should be dismissed, and have
therefore forfeited it. Summary judgment is granted on that affirmative defense.

E. Affirmative Defenses 5 and 6

Defendant's fifth affirmative defense claims unjust enrichment on the theory that ""Plaintiff has already been compensated for
the use of the choreography[.]"" (Defs.' Resp. 18.) This essentially repeats Defendants’ arguments that Myers has been
compensated for creating the dances, either as works-for-hire or under a license. Any other argument about Plaintiff's
compensation is more appropriately a question of damages, not a bar to recovery. Similarly, Affirmative Defense 6 argues
that the dances are works-for-hire, a matter the court has addressed extensively. The court has granted summary judgment
in favor of Plaintiff on these defenses.

F. Affirmative Defense 7

As a seventh affirmative defense, Defendants invoked the doctrines of ""fair use,"" ""first sale,"" and ""joint works of authorship.""
In an interrogatory answer, Defendants expanded this defense, suggesting that the choreographed works had educational
purposes; that the use they made of the Myers's work was ""transformative;"" that Defendants had a license to use the works;
and that Defendants contributed to or commissioned the works. Defendants have offered no evidence concerning the
""educational"" or ""fair"" use of the dances, nor any evidence concerning ""first sale,"" so the court need not address those
defenses.

That leaves the contention that Defendants’ use of the dances was ""transformative"" and that Defendants enjoyed joint
ownership of the copyrights. Myers has shown that, with limited exceptions identified below, there is no genuine dispute on
these issues. The only support for the claim that their use was ""transformative"" is that the props and costumes that appear in
the videos that Myers submitted to the Copyright Office were different from those used in the recital. This is not
transformative use. ""[A] work is not considered transformative if it serves the same purpose as plaintiff's original or derivative
works."" Ty. Inc. v. Publications Int'l, Ltd. . 333 F.Supp.2d 705 , 712 (N.D. Ill. 2004). In7y , the allegedly infringing work was a
collection of photographs of Beanie Babies. /d. The court held that the toys, considered ""soft sculptures,"" and the
photographs ""serve[d] an aesthetic, decorative purpose—to be viewed and enjoyed

[279 F.Supp.3d 800]


--- Page 12 ---
as works of visual art."" /d. Because they had the same purpose, the photograph book was not transformative use. /d. In this
case, that the videos that Myers submitted to the Copyright Office show specific performances of the dances does not mean
that her copyright covers only those performances. Changing costumes does not transform the choreography itself.

Defendants’ claim of joint authorship of the choreography fares no better, at least with respect to Baby I'm a Star , Desperate
Housewives , and Guts & Glory. It is undisputed that Myers choreographed those dances. There is some evidence of joint

authorship for Music Box Dancer : A parent of a student who performed Music Box Dancer claims that the dance was not
completed when Myers left TDS, and Myers and Ryan Brandt are jointly listed as choreographers in the recital program.
Further, because there is no evidence about the authorship of Turn Down for What, Plaintiff has not shown that there is no
dispute concerning joint authorship for that dance, either. Summary judgment is granted to Plaintiff on the ""transformative""
use defense and on the ""joint authorship"" defense with respect to Baby I'm a Star, Desperate Housewives , and Guts &
Glory. \|t was Brandt, not TDS, who contributed to the choreography for Music Box Dancer and perhaps for Turn Down for

What, but assuming that TDS is entitled to assert a joint authorship defense, summary judgment is denied with respect to
those two dances.

CONCLUSION

Defendants’ motion for summary judgment [51] is denied. Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment [35] is granted in part and
denied in part.

Notes:

1Defendant has marked this and other facts as undisputed ""solely for the purpose of responding to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment."" (Defs.'
Resp. to PSOF {1 n.1.) The court deems these facts admitted for purposes of ruling on Defendants’ own motion as well.

2The ad also describes an opening for a yoga instructor position, not relevant to this case.

3 Defendants also claim that other ""TDS instructors generally create choreography during their studio time with students|,]"" (Defs.' Joint L.R. 56.1(b)
Statement of Additional Material Facts Opposing PI.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [57] § 9), but Defendants have not explained how this is relevant.

4 At some point during her employment, Myers was also paid for ""extra duties,"" such as creating recital programs and finding performance opportunities
for dance students. (Myers Dep. 44:19-45:11, 72:13-73:1.)

3 Defendants also cite to the declaration of another dance instructor, Ryan Brandt, who claims to have been compensated for time spent teaching and
choreographing dances. (Decl. of Ryan Brandt, Ex. E to DSOF [53-1 at p. 58] 94 5-8, 15.) But Defendants do not explain why Myers's expectations were
the same as Brandt's, which is the only reason Brandt's expectations would be relevant.

&Though Myers created the document, it is not clear what prompted her or TDS to require students to make this commitment.

ZThe court cites to the 2014-2015 version of the FCDC Contract; though the 2012-2013 version of the agreement is also in the record (Ex. B to Ex. G to
DSOF [53-1 at p. 75] ), no party contends that the 2012-2013 version was in operation at the time of the allegedly infringing conduct.

8 Parents of students who participated on the FCDC team also described the contents of the FCDC Contract. ( See Decl. of Kathy Slusinksi, Ex. G to
DSOF [53-1 at p. 62] 4 11; Decl. of Nicole Connell, Ex. H to DSOF [53-1 at p. 78] 4 12.) This testimony is also not admissible. Fed. R. Evid. 1002.

2 Without identifying any particular dance, Harold conceded that Myers ""created the choreography that was performed by the dance team."" (Harold Dep.
48:8-49:12.) The court presumes that the five dances were to be performed by the dance team, because, as noted above, Myers only taught FCDC
dancers during the 2014-2015 dance season.

10 Myers produced videos of Desperate Housewives and Guts & Glory that she claims were filmed before February 25, 2015. (Defs.' Resp. to PSOF
38.) Defendants concede only that videos ""appear to have been filmed"" before this date ( id. ), but there is no evidence disputing this fact and the court
deems it admitted.

1 Plaintiff notes that the FCDC Contract was also not produced during discovery, although that document is the centerpiece of Defendants’ argument.
The parties’ discovery failures are puzzling, but the court sees no evidence of bad faith and declines to exclude these materials.

12 Presumably the remaining 15% was choreographed by Ryan Brandt, who is listed as the second choreographer in the recital program. (Recital
Program.)

13 Myers also points out that Harold testified that she never ""assert[ed] ownership"" of any choreography that Myers developed. (Harold Dep. 127:16-24.)

14 Defendants do not explain why this is true; if the team did not compete simply because it no longer had a coach, this fact is irrelevant. If, however,
FCDC did not compete because Myers told Defendants that they could not use her dances, such an action may be a tacit admission by Defendants that
Myers owned the copyrights.

18 Harold could not recall whether Brandt made some alterations to Myers's choreography of Baby I'm a Star. (Harold Dep. 59:15-60:6.)

16 In support of their statement that they did not have this knowledge, Defendants cite only their interrogatory answers (they also cite a declaration from a
parent of one of the students, but have not explained how this parent could testify to Harold's knowledge). Myers, for her part, does not cite to any
evidence concerning Harold's advance knowledge that students would perform at Alsip's Got Talent. (PI.'s Resp. to DSOF § 54.)

12The court is uncertain as to the effective date of the registrations. Both parties apparently agree that the effective dates are June 1, 2015 (Defs.' Resp.
to PSOF 4 50), but the court does not see how the date of approval and the effective dates could be before the date the applications were submitted.
See Have a Question About Copyright Registration? , U.S. Copyright Office , https://www.copyright.gov/fls/sl09.pdf (last visited August 18, 2017)
(effective date of copyright registration is the date that the Copyright Office receives all required elements of the application). The certificates themselves
state an effective date of June 1, 2016. (Ex. 8-10 to Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. [37-8], [37-9], [37—10].)



--- Page 13 ---
18 In the complaint, Count | refers to both the recital and ""other performances"" (Compl. [1] {| 38), but Plaintiff only addresses the recital in her motion for
summary judgment. (PI.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. [37] 9.) The court therefore assumes that Count | refers only to the recital.

12 Defendants claim that ""Plaintiff admits that the choreography performed at the performances challenged in this lawsuit 'wasn't [hers]'."" (DSOAF § 33
(alteration in original) (purportedly quoting Myers Dep. 220:8).) But this part of Myers's deposition does not contain the quotation. The court assumes that
the cite refers to a different part of Myers's deposition:

Q: As you sit here today, can you think of any other ways you've been monetarily damaged by the use of the Choreographic Works at the
spring 2015 recital?

[Objection omitted]
A: | don't know.

Q: What about the dances being used at the summer performances or summer activities, how have you been damaged as a result of the
dances being performed there?

[Objection omitted]

A: | just feel that since it wasn't mine and | didn't rehearse it, | didn't clean it, that it could have damaged my reputation as a choreographer.

(Myers Dep. 236:14-237:10 (emphasis added).) In this context, ""it"" likely refers to the performances themselves and Myers's lack of involvement in the
performance of her choreography. The court sees no admission that Myers did not create the dances.

20 Neither Reid nor Natkin discusses this factor in detail, but it appears that the reasoning is that when a defendant is a ""business,"" it is more likely to
have regular employees, as opposed to conducting individual transactions with contractors. Cf. Reid__490 U.S. at 752 , 109 S.Ct. 2166 ; Natkin__111
F.Supp.2d at 1008 —09.

21 Defendants’ other citations are unhelpful. They assert that Marobie—FL, 983 F.Supp. at 1178 , ""adopted"" the approach of Religious Technology Center
. Marobie-FL is a case from this district, not the Seventh Circuit, as Defendants suggest, and it discusses ReligiousTechnology Center in the context of
direct infringement and vicarious liability, not contributory infringement. /d. at 1176-79. Defendants also cite A & M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc. , 239
F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001) , as amended (Apr. 3, 2001), affd sub nom. A & M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc. , 284 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir. 2002) , but give no
explanation for how this case supports their argument. Defendants’ assertion that A & M Records was ""adopted"" by Metro—Goldwyn— Mayer Studios Inc.
v. Grokster, Ltd. 545 U.S. 913 , 924, 125 S.Ct. 2764 , 162 L.Ed.2d 781 (2005) is also incorrect. Grokster merely referred to the underlying suit in A & M
Records in its account of the development of the technology at issue in that case.

SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge:

On this appeal we must decide whether, under the Copyright Act, a plaintiff may recover actual damages accruing from
the unauthorized exploitation abroad of copyrighted work infringed in the United States; whether defendants’ exploitation of
the work was protected as fair use; and whether the

Page 990
district court erred in its award of statutory damages.
BACKGROUND

Los Angeles News (LANS) is an independent news organization which produces video and audio tape recordings of
newsworthy events and licenses them for profit. During the April 1992 riots following the Rodney King verdict, LANS covered
the events at Florence Avenue and Normandie Boulevard in Los Angeles from its helicopter, producing two videotapes: ""The
Beating of Reginald Denny"" and ""Beating of Man in White Panel Truck"" (the works). LANS copyrighted these works and
licensed them to National Broadcasting Company, Inc. (NBC), which used them on the Today show with the logo of KCOP,
a Los Angeles station not affiliated with NBC, superimposed (known in the trade as the downstream). Under the agreement,
LANS retained ownership of the works and the right to license them.

The Reuters defendants (Reuters Television International, Ltd., Reuters America Holdings, Inc., and Reuters America,
Inc., collectively Reuters) are television news agencies that gather and provide audiovisual and other news material to their
subscribers for an annual fee. Visnews International (USA), Ltd. (Visnews), a joint venture of Reuters Television Limited,
NBC and the British Broadcasting Company, had a news supply agreement with NBC News Overseas. When NBC
broadcast the Today show featuring the LANS footage to its affiliates, it simultaneously transmitted the show via fiber link to
Visnews in New York. Visnews made a videotape copy of the works as broadcast and transmitted it to subscribers in Europe
and Africa. It also transmitted copies of the videotape to the New York office of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),


--- Page 2 ---
which in turn made a videotape copy and transmitted it via satellite to Reuters’ London branch, which provided copies to its
subscribers.

LANS brought this action for copyright infringement against the Reuters defendants and Visnews. Defendants moved
for summary judgment on several grounds. So far as relevant to this appeal, they contended that (1) extraterritorial
infringement does not violate American copyright law, (2) the fair use doctrine precludes a finding of infringement, and (3)
LANS had no evidence of actual damage. The district court granted defendants' motion with respect to extraterritorial
infringement and the claim for actual damages. ' It denied the motion with respect to the fair use defense and entered partial
summary judgment for LANS determining that the defense did not shield defendants’ actions. Following a bench trial on the
remaining issues, the district court found that Visnews had infringed by making one copy of each videotape and contributing
to the making by EBU of one copy of each tape, LANS failed to prove the infringement was willful, and defendants failed to
prove that it was innocent. The court entered judgment for LANS for $60,000 in statutory damages based on the four
domestic infringements by Visnews. 2 In a subsequent order, the court denied LANS's and Reuters’ applications for costs
and attorney's fees.

LANS appeals from the ruling barring extraterritorial damages and defendants cross-appeal from the ruling denying the
fair use defense and from the damage award. Both appeal from the order denying attorney's fees and costs. We have
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

DISCUSSION
|. EXTRATERRITORIAL DAMAGES
It is settled that the Copyright Act does not apply extraterritorially. Subafilms, Ltd. v. MGM-Pathe Communications Co.

24 F.3d 1088 , 1094 (9th Cir.1994) (en banc). For the Act to apply, ""at least one alleged infringement must be completed
entirely within the United States."" Allarcom Pay Television Ltd. v. General Instrument Corp.,

Page 991

69 F.3d 381 , 387 (9th Cir.1995). The district court found that ""any damages arising extraterritorially are the result of
extraterritorial infringement."" Reuters |, 942 F.Supp. at 1269 . Relying on Allarcom, the court held that ""[t]he transmissions
from Visnews and [EBU] did not violate the Copyright Act.... Therefore, Defendants are not liable ... for damages arising
extraterritorially."" Id. at 1269. We review the district court's grant of partial summary judgment de novo. Amdahl Corp. v.
Profit Freight Sys., Inc., 65 F.3d 144 , 146 (9th Cir.1995).

The district court's ruling was premised on the assumption that LANS's claim was based on the transmissions from
Visnews and EBU to Reuters. However, it also held that Visnews completed acts of infringement in the United States when
it copied the works in New York and then transmitted them to EBU which also copied them in New York. Each act of copying
constituted a completed act of infringement. See 17 U.S.C. § 106(1). It was only after these domestic acts of infringement
had been completed that Visnews and EBU transmitted the works abroad.

This case then presents a situation different from that in Subafilms and Allarcom. In Subafilms, the allegedly infringing
conduct consisted solely of authorization given within the United States for foreign distribution of infringing videocassettes.
24 F.3d at 1090 n. 3. Similarly, in Allarcom, the alleged infringement consisted either of authorization given in the United
States for infringement in Canada or broadcasts of copyright material from the United States into Canada, with the
infringement not completed until the signals were received in Canada. 69 F.3d at 387 .

The issue before us-which the Subafilms court did not resolve-is whether LANS ""may recover damages for
international distribution of the [works] based on the theory that an act of direct infringement, in the form of a reproduction of
the ... [works], took place in the United States."" Subafilms, 24 F.3d at 1099 ; see also id. at 1094. While this circuit has not
heretofore addressed the issue, the Second Circuit has done so in a line of cases beginning with Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn
Pictures Corp., 106 F.2d 45 , 52 (2d Cir.1939), aff'd,309 U.S. 390 , 60 S.Ct. 681 , 84 L.Ed. 825 (1940) . In Sheldon the court
held, in an opinion by Judge Learned Hand, that plaintiff could recover the profits from exhibiting a motion picture abroad
where the infringing copy had been made in the United States. As Judge Hand explained:

The [copyrighted film] negatives were ""records"" from which the work could be ""reproduced"", and it was a tort to make them
in this country. The plaintiffs acquired an equitable interest in them as soon as they were made, which attached to any profits
from their exploitation, whether in the form of money remitted to the United States, or of increase in the value of shares of
foreign companies held by the defendants. We need not decide whether the law of those countries where the negatives
were exploited, recognized the plaintiffs’ equitable interest; we can assume arguendo that it did not, for, as soon as any of
the profits so realized took the form of property whose situs was in the United States, our law seized upon them and
impressed them with a constructive trust, whatever their form.

106 F.2d at 52. See also Update Art. Inc. v. Modiin Publ'g, Ltd.. 843 F.2d 67 , 73 (2d Cir.1988) (permitting
recovery of copyright damages accruing abroad from illegal copying in the United States); Famous Music Corp. v. Seeco
Records, Inc.. 201 F.Supp. 560 , 568-69 (S.D.N.Y.1961) (same). See also 4 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on
Copyright § 14.05, at 14-96 (1996) (stating that copyright holders acquire an equitable interest in infringing works produced
in the United States as soon as they come into being). Subafilms described these cases as being ""based ... on the theory
that the infringing use would have been actionable even if the subsequent foreign distribution



--- Page 3 ---
Page 992

that stemmed from that use never took place."" 24 F.3d at 1094 . Recovery of damages arising from overseas infringing uses
was allowed because the predicate act of infringement occurring within the United States enabled further reproduction
abroad. 3

LANS urges us to adopt the Second Circuit's rule because the unauthorized copying of its works in the United States
enabled further exploitation abroad. While the extraterritorial damages resulted from Reuters's overseas dissemination of the
works received by satellite transmissions from Visnews and EBU, those transmissions were made possible by the infringing
acts of copying in New York. The satellite transmissions, thus, were merely a means of shipping the unlicensed footage
abroad for further dissemination.

The Subafilms court's concerns are inapplicable to the present case. The Second Circuit rule would not permit
application of American law to ""acts of infringement that take place entirely abroad."" Subafilms, 24 F.3d at 1098 . Nor would
a copyright holder be entitled to recover extraterritorial damages unless the damages flowed from extraterritorial exploitation
of an infringing act that occurred in the United States. In Subafilms, the court reasoned that liability based solely on the
authorization of infringing acts ""would produce the untenable anomaly, inconsistent with the general principles of third party
liability, that a party could be held liable as an infringer for violating the ‘authorization’ right when the party that it authorized
could not be considered an infringer under the Copyright Act."" 24 F.3d at 1094 ; see also 3 Nimmer, supra, § 12.04[A][b], at
12-88 to 12-93 (""It is perverse to construe Congress' intention as holding liable a person who authorizes an activity that is
perfectly legal abroad.""). Under the Second Circuit's rule, by contrast, a party becomes liable for extraterritorial damages
only when an act of infringement occurs within the United States, subjecting it to liability as an infringer (or a contributory
infringer) under the Copyright Act. Cf. Robert Stigwood Group Ltd. v. O'Reilly, 530 F.2d 1096 , 1100-01 (2d Cir.1976)
(copyright holders cannot recover for unauthorized performances of copyrighted work in Canada merely because the
performers may have assembled and arranged all necessary elements in the United States); De Bardossy v. Puski, 763
F.Supp. 1239 (S.D.N.Y.1991) ; Gaste v. Kaiserman, 683 F.Supp. 63 , 65 (S.D.N.Y.1988), aff'd, 863 F.2d 1061 (2d Cir.1988)
; Ahbez v. Edwin H. Morris & Co. Inc., 548 F.Supp. 664 , 667 (S.D.N.Y.1982).

Defendants’ argument that adoption of the Second Circuit rule would permit plaintiffs to circumvent the statute of
limitation by recovering damages for distribution abroad occurring many years after the infringing act in the United States is
without merit. An action must be ""commenced within three years after the claim accrued."" 17 U.S.C. § 507(b). A claim
accrues when an act of infringement occurs, not when consequent damage is suffered. See Roley v. New World Pictures
Lid., 19 F.3d 479 , 481 (9th Cir.1994). A plaintiff's right to damages is limited to those suffered during the statutory period for
bringing claims, regardless of where they may have been incurred.

We therefore hold that LANS is entitled to recover damages flowing from exploitation abroad of the domestic acts of
infringement committed by defendants.

Il. FAIR USE
A. Summary Judgment

Defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of collateral estoppel, relying on the ruling of a district court in
another case involving the same works but a different defendant. + Inasmuch as that ruling was reversed on appeal, that
issue is moot. In its

Page 993

response to defendants’ motion, LANS contended that fair use was inapplicable as a defense to the action. Defendants’
reply memorandum did not address the fair use issue, nor did defendants object to the district court's treatment of LANS'
response as a motion for partial summary judgment. 5 On appeal, defendants for the first time argue that triable issues
existed precluding entry of partial summary judgment. Defendants cite our decision in Los Angeles News Service v. KCAL-
TV Channel 9, 108 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir.1997) , cert. denied, --- U.S. ----,118 S.Ct. 81 , 139 L.Ed.2d 39 (1997) , reversing
summary judgment for defendant based on fair use. Defendants identify no triable issues, however, arising under the facts
of this case. While KCAL involved the same works, it arose in a different context. Unlike the district court in KCAL, the court
here made a thorough analysis of the evidence bearing on the relevant factors under § 107. Because there are no genuine
issues of material fact and ""the district court has found facts sufficient to evaluate each of the statutory factors, an appellate
court need not remand for further fact finding but may conclude as a matter of law that the challenged use does not qualify
as a fair use of the copyright work."" Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enter., 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85
L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (quoting Pacific & Southern Co. v. Duncan, 744 F.2d 1490 , 1495 (11th Cir.1984)) (internal quotations
and notations omitted); see also Los Angeles News Serv. v. Tullo, 973 F.2d 791 , 796 (9th Cir.1992) (""Where the district
court has found facts sufficient to evaluate each of the statutory factors considered in determining fair use, ... we may
determine as a matter of law whether the challenged use is a fair one.""); Fisher v. Dees, 794 F.2d 432 , 436 (9th Cir.1986)
(rejecting argument that fair use is appropriate for determination by summary judgment only when no reasonable jury could
have decided the question differently).

B. Merits

The district court rejected the fair use defense after finding that three of the § 107 factors favored LANS. § In substance,
the court found the uses were commercial rather than nonprofit and not very transformative, that they took the ""heart"" of the


--- Page 4 ---
work, and that allowing such uses ""would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original
works."" Reuters |, 942 F.Supp. at 1274 .

We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. Ledo Fin. Corp. v. Summers, 122 F.3d 825 , 827 (9th Cir.1997). ""Fair
use is a mixed question of law and fact,"" which we also review de novo. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 560 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ;
Tullo, 973 F.2d at 796 . In doing so, we must balance the nonexclusive factors set out in 17 U.S.C. § 107. Harper & Row,
471 U.S. at 549 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 .

1. Purpose and Character of Use

Although defendants' service does have a news reporting purpose, its use of the works was not very transformative.
Reuters copies footage and transmits it to news reporting organizations; Reuters does not explain the footage, edit the
content of the footage, or include editorial comment. ""Although such transformative use is not absolutely necessary for a
finding of fair use, ... the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like
commercialism, that may weigh against a

Page 994

finding of fair use."" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)
(citations omitted).

Reuters used the works for a commercial purpose, providing the works to other news reporting organizations in
exchange for an annual fee. While a commercial use does not by itself preclude a defense of fair use, ""every commercial use
of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation of the monopoly privilege that belongs to the owner of the
copyright."" Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 451, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) .
Further, ""[t]he crux of the profit/non-profit distinction is ... whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the
copyrighted material without paying the customary price."" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . LANS normally
charges customers for the privilege of copying portions of its works. The district court did not err in finding that this factor
weighed in favor of LANS.

Defendants argue that if a broadcaster's use of the works for news reporting may constitute fair use, then ""it is obvious
that the transmission of such Works to a broadcaster for such purpose cannot ... be deemed an infringement."" The argument
misses the point for it is not the transmission that is the infringement but the unauthorized copying of the works. Moreover,
in Tullo, the court held that the defendant news clipping service-an organization that monitored news programs, recorded
them on videotape, and sold copies to interested individuals-was not protected by the fair use defense. 973 F.2d at 799 .
The defendant, AVRS, argued that the first factor should weigh in its favor because its clients used the tapes for ""research,
scholarship and private study."" ” Id. at 797. The court held that ""the ultimate use to which the customer puts the tape is
irrelevant, as is the use AVRS's customers make of the tapes AVRS sells."" Id. Thus, the question of whether defendants’
copying and transmission of the works constitutes fair use is distinct from whether their subscribers' broadcasts of the works
are fair use.

2. Nature of Copyrighted Work

The works were factual and informational, see Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Moral Majority, Inc., 796 F.2d 1148 , 1153-54
(9th Cir.1986), and had been published by LANS before their use by Reuters. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564 , 105
S.Ct. 2218 . The district court did not err in finding that this factor weighed in favor of defendants.

3. Amount and Substantiality of What Was Used

The district court found that this factor weighed in favor of LANS because even though Reuters used only a small
portion of the works, it was taken from the ""heart"" of the works. See id. at 565-66, 105 S.Ct. 2218 . The court noted that
Visnews had copied footage from NBC's newscast, which had edited the LANS footage and selected the ""heart"" of it, and
that Reuters presumably used footage from newscasts. Defendants do not contest this factor.

4. Effect on Market

The district court correctly found that this factor weighed in favor of LANS. The court reasoned that although LANS
could not prove loss of subsequent sales of the works, and hence actual adverse effect on the market for videotape footage,
defendants' actions should not go unpunished. Such actions if permitted would result in a substantially adverse impact on
the potential market for the original works. Reuters and LANS are in the business of providing audiovisual news material to
reporting organizations. When such an organization buys footage from Reuters, it does not need to purchase it from LANS,
thus lessening the market for LANS's footage. Defendants do not contest this factor.

In sum, the district court, having found that only one of the four statutory factors weighed in favor of defendants,
correctly concluded that the fair use defense did not apply. See Tullo, 973 F.2d at 799 (holding fair use did not shield a
defendant from
Page 995

liability when only one of the four statutory factors weighed in its favor).


--- Page 5 ---
Ill. STATUTORY DAMAGES

Because we reverse the district court's ruling on extraterritorial damages and affirm its ruling on the fair use defense,
we must remand for a new trial on actual damages. Accordingly, we conditionally vacate the award of statutory damages.
LANS retains the right, however, to make an election before final judgment to recover statutory damages instead of actual
damages and profits. § 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1). Should LANS elect statutory damages, the district court should reinstate its
prior award. Against that eventuality, we will address defendants’ cross-appeal challenging the statutory damages award.

A. Innocent Infringement 9

The district court found that defendants did not sustain their burden of proving that they were not aware and had no
reason to believe that their acts constituted an infringement of copyright, and thus were not entitled to the reduction in
statutory damages under § 504(c)(2). Whether the defendants’ infringement was innocent is a factual determination which
we review for clear error. See Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 772 F.2d 505 , 515 (9th Cir.1985).

1. LANS's works were embedded in a licensed work

Defendants contend first that they had ""no practicable alternative but to copy those portions of [LANS's] works which
were embedded in a licensed work."" But practicability is not a proxy for innocence. The argument does not sustain the
burden of proving that Visnews ""was not aware and had no reason to believe that [its] acts constituted an infringement."" §
504(c)(2).

2. Defendants' awareness of limitations on use

Defendants contend that there was no evidence that Visnews accessed the NBC desk log to discover restrictions on
the material, and that knowledge of the desk log entry would not have alerted Visnews that the Today show contained the
works. Their arguments, however, do not address the ground on which the district court based its ruling.

The court agreed that there was no evidence that anyone at Visnews saw the log entry or that knowledge of the entry
would have alerted Visnews that copying the NBC feed would violate LANS's copyrights. And it found that there was no
direct evidence in the record as to the state of mind of the Visnews or EBU employees who made the infringing copies from
the NBC and Visnews feeds.

The court also found, however, that it can be inferred that whoever at Visnews and EBU made the copies of the Today
show knew that the feed contained ""a downstream that credited KCOP for the production."" 1° Reuters II, 942 F.Supp. at
1280 . The downstream

Page 996

indicates that the portion of tape belongs to someone other than NBC and ""could indicate that there were in fact restrictions
on any further use of the copyrighted works, and lead a reasonable person to inquire whether copying the feed would
infringe a copyright held by KCOP or by another."" Id.

Defendants have the burden of proving that the infringement was innocent. See 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2). The district
court's finding that they failed to meet their burden is not clearly erroneous.

B. Even Assuming No Innocent Infringement, the Award Was Excessive

Defendants argue, in the alternative, that the award was excessive because LANS licensed the works to the networks
and others for lesser amounts and had even established a liquidated damage figure of $10,000 for un authorized use of the
works.

The district court has ""wide discretion in determining the amount of statutory damages to be awarded, constrained only
by the specified maxima and minima."" Harris v. Emus Records Corp.. 734 F.2d 1329 , 1335 (9th Cir.1984) (citing L.A.
Westermann Co. v. Dispatch Printing Co., 249 U.S. 100 , 39 S.Ct. 194 , 63 L.Ed. 499 (1919) ). The court is guided by ""what
is just in the particular case, considering the nature of the copyright, the circumstances of the infringement and the like.""
Peer Int'l Corp. v. Pausa Records, Inc., 909 F.2d 1332 , 1336 (9th Cir.1990) (quoting F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary
Arts, Inc.. 344 U.S. 228 , 232,73 S.Ct. 222 , 97 L.Ed. 276 (1952) ). Because awards of statutory damages serve both
compensatory and punitive purposes, a plaintiff may recover statutory damages ""whether or not there is adequate evidence
of the actual damages suffered by plaintiff or of the profits reaped by defendant,"" Harris, 734 F.2d at 1335 , in order"" 'to
sanction and vindicate the statutory policy’ of discouraging infringement."" Peer Int'l Corp., 909 F.2d at 1337 (quoting
Woolworth Co., 344 U.S. at 233 , 73 S.Ct. 222 ).

The court found that although LANS charged the networks only $3,500 for the licenses, these licenses carried
numerous restrictions and were of limited duration. Later licenses with various restrictions and durations brought from
$5,000 to $6,500. LANS secured a total of $250,000 to $300,000 in license fees for the Reginald Denny tape and less for
the other tape. LANS would have charged $250,000 for an unlimited domestic license for the works. The court also took into
account the public benefit from such works and the need to encourage their creation. To this end, LANS ""must be allowed to
profit from them, without concern that expediency, exigent circumstances or the very nature of the fast-breaking news-
gathering business will deprive [it] of potential profits from those works."" Reuters II, 942 F.Supp. at 1283 .


--- Page 6 ---
The district court ""is in a better position than are we to determine appropriate damages."" Harris, 734 F.2d at 1335 ;
Peer Int'l Corp., 909 F.2d at 1337 . Its determination of the amount of statutory damages was not clearly erroneous.

C. Visnews's Contributory Infringement by Providing EBU a Copy of the Works

Defendants also argue that the statutory penalties must be reduced by one-half because the district court erred in ruling
that Visnews is liable for contributory infringement with respect to the copies made by EBU of the works Visnews transmitted
to it. The district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that defendants waived this issue, not having raised it until closing
argument. Moreover, each side submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law that calculated statutory
damages on the basis of all four infringements. We will not take up an issue not properly raised below unless necessary to
prevent manifest injustice. International Union of Bricklayers & Allied Craftsman Local Union No. 20 v. Martin Jaska, Inc.,
752 F.2d 1401 , 1404 (9th Cir.1985). Because defendants have failed to show exceptional circumstances explaining their
default, see id., we need not address the issue.

Page 997
IV. DENIAL OF ATTORNEY FEES

The district court denied the applications for attorney's fees, concluding that ""both parties prevailed on significant issues
in the case and thus neither can be viewed to be the prevailing party."" (Emphasis in the original.) Because we reverse the
district court's ruling on extraterritorial damages and remand for a trial on actual damages, we must vacate the attorney's
fees order without prejudice, of course, to further proceedings following trial.

LANS requests attorney's fees on appeal pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 505. We conclude that fees are warranted inasmuch
as it served the purposes of the Copyright Act for LANS to establish its right to extraterritorial damages and to defend its
favorable ruling below on fair use. Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, 94 F.3d 553 , 561 (9th Cir.1996). We award LANS its costs and
attorney's fees on appeal, the amount to be determined by the district court on remand.

CONCLUSION

The district court's judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part. We AFFIRM the court's ruling barring the fair use
defense. We REVERSE the ruling barring the claim for extraterritorial damages and REMAND for a trial on actual damages,
with directions that if LANS elects to recover actual damages, the award of statutory damages be vacated. If LANS elects to
recover statutory damages, the present award shall stand. The ruling denying attorney's fees and costs is VACATED without
prejudice to further proceedings upon entry of judgment. We award LANS its attorney's fees and costs on appeal, the
amount of attorney's fees to be determined by the district court on remand.

* Honorable William W Schwarzer, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.

1 The district court considered only LANS's claims of domestic damages. See Los Angeles News Serv. v. Reuters Television Int'l, Ltd., 942 F.Supp. 1265
, 1274 n. 7 (C.D.Cal.1996) (""Reuters I"").

2 The decision is reported at 942 F.Supp. 1275 (C.D.Cal.1996) (""Reuters II"").
3 No other circuits appear to have addressed this issue.

4 Defendants’ collateral estoppel argument rested on the summary judgment granted by another district court to the defendant in Los Angeles News
Service v. KCAL-TV Channel 9, later reversed by this court. 108 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir.1997) , cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 81 , 139 L.Ed.2d 39 (1997)
. Unlike the defendants in this case, KCAL was one of several Los Angeles television stations that broadcast the Reginald Denny tape after LANS had
refused to grant a license. See id. at 1120.

5 The procedure followed by the trial court was proper, see Portsmouth Square, Inc. v. Shareholders Protective Comm., 770 F.2d 866 , 869 (9th
Cir.1985), but does not bar defendants from arguing on appeal that triable issues precluded entry of partial summary judgment for LANS.

6 § 107, provides in relevant part:

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work ... for purposes such as ... news reporting, ... is not an
infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include-

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

7 17 U.S.C. § 107 enumerates scholarship and research as fair uses.

8 The district court, having ruled against LANS's claim for extraterritorial damages, also ruled that LANS failed ""to meet its burden of proving actual
[domestic] damages, so, at most it is entitled to statutory damages."" Reuters |, 942 F.Supp. at 1275 . Because LANS was foreclosed by these rulings
from seeking actual damages, it had no opportunity to make the statutory election on damages. It is therefore not precluded from appealing the district
court's ruling regarding actual damages. Compare Oboler v. Goldin, 714 F.2d 211 , 212-13 (2d Cir.1983) (per curiam) (damages appealable where
copyright holder failed to elect between statutory and actual damages prior to directed verdict), with Twin Peaks Prods.., Inc. v. Publications Int'l, Ltd. 996
F.2d 1366 , 1380 (2d Cir.1993) (""Once a plaintiff has elected statutory damages, it has given up the right to seek actual damages and may not renew that
right on appeal by cross-appealing to seek an increase in actual damages.""); see also Jordan v. Time, Inc., 111 F.3d 102 , 104 (11th Cir.1997) (per

curiam) (same).

9 Section 504(c)(2) provides in relevant part:

(2) ... Ina case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe
that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less
than $200....

10 Defendants do not attack this finding on appeal.

Before: Jacobs, Calabresi, Raggi, Circuit Judges.

Reena Raggi, Circuit Judge:

In this action for copyright infringement, plaintiffs, successors-in-interest to the estates of William “Bud” Abbott and Lou
Costello, appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (George B. Daniels, Jr., Judge ) in favor of defendants, who include the producers of Hand to God and the play's
author, Robert Askins. See TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 151 F.Supp.3d 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Plaintiffs assert that the
district court erred in concluding from the amended complaint that defendants’ use of a portion of the iconic Abbott and
Costello comedy routine, Who's on First? , in Act | of Hand to God was so transformative as to establish defendants’ fair use
defense as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Defendants here not only defend the district court's fair use
determination but also argue that affirmance is warranted, in any event, by plaintiffs’ failure to plead a valid copyright
interest. The district court rejected that argument. See TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 151 F.Supp.3d at 430-31.4

For the reasons explained herein, we conclude that defendants’ verbatim incorporation of more than a minute of the Who's
on First? routine in their commercial production was not a fair use of the material. Nevertheless, we affirm dismissal because
plaintiffs fail plausibly to allege a valid copyright interest.

|. Background

The following facts derive from plaintiffs' amended complaint, incorporated exhibits, and documents susceptible to judicial
notice. See Goel v. Bunge, Ltd. , 820 F.3d 554 , 559 (2d Cir. 2016) (acknowledging that, on motion to dismiss, courts may
consider documents appended to or incorporated in complaint and matters of which judicial notice may be taken); Island
Software & Comput. Serv., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. . 413 F.3d 257 , 261 (2d Cir. 2005) (stating that court may take judicial
notice of copyright registrations). For purposes of this appeal, we presume these facts to be true. See Anschutz Corp. v.
Merrill Lynch & Co. , 690 F.3d 98 , 102 (2d Cir. 2012).

A. Abbott and Costello's Who's on First? Routine

Abbott and Costello were a popular mid-Twentieth Century comedy duo. One of their routines, commonly referred to as
Who's on First? (also, the “Routine”), has become a treasured piece of American entertainment history.2 The Routine's
humor derives from misunderstandings that arise when Abbott announces the roster of a baseball team filled with such
oddly named players as “Who,” “What,” and “I Don't Know.” A rapid-fire exchange reveals that “who's on first” need not be a
question. It can be a statement of fact, i.e. , a player named “Who’ is the first baseman. Later parts of the routine reveal,
after similar comic misunderstandings, that a player

[839 F.3d 173]
named “What” is the second baseman, and one named “| Don't Know’ is the third baseman.

B. Agreements Pertaining to Rights in the Routine

The parties cite various contracts and copyright filings spanning more than 40 years as relevant to claimed rights in the
Routine.


--- Page 2 ---
1. Abbott and Costello's Agreements with UPC

a. The July 1940 Agreement

Abbott and Costello first performed Who's on First? in the late 1930s, notably on a 1938 live radio broadcast of The Kate
Smith Hour . The Routine was published for purposes of federal copyright law when Abbott and Costello performed a
version of it in their first motion picture, One Night in the Tropics (“Tropics ”). 2

The team appeared in Tropics pursuant to a July 24, 1940 contract (the “July Agreement”) with Universal Pictures Company,
Inc. (“UPC”). The July Agreement guaranteed Abbott and Costello a minimum of five weeks' work at a pay rate of $3,500 per
week. In turn, Abbott and Costello (the “Artists”) agreed to grant UPC (the “Producer”) certain rights and to furnish it with
certain items. We reproduce the relevant text here, adding bracketed signals and highlighting to distinguish various
provisions:

[1] The Artists expressly give and grant to the Producer the sole and exclusive right to photograph and/or
otherwise reproduce any and all of their acts, poses, plays and appearances of any and all kinds during the term
hereof, and [2] further agree [a] to furnish to the Producer, without charge to it, the material and routines
heretofore used and now owned by the Artists for use by the Producer in the photoplay in which they appear
hereunder and for which the Producer shall have the exclusive motion picture rights, and [b] to record their voices
and all instrumental, musical and other sound effects produced by them, and [c] to reproduce and/or transmit the
same, either separately or in conjunction with such acts, poses, plays and appearances as the Producer may
desire, and further [3] give and grant to the Producer solely and exclusively all rights of every kind and character
whatsoever in and to the same, or any of them, perpetually, including as well the perpetual right to use the
names of the Artists and pictures or other reproductions of the Artists' physical likenesses, and recordations and
reproductions of the Artists’ voices, in connection with the advertising and exploitation thereof.

J.A. 168-69.
b. The November 1940 Agreement

On November 6, 1940, only days before Tropics 's public release, Abbott and Costello entered into a new multi-year/multi-
picture agreement with UPC (the “November Agreement’). 4 That contract terminated

[839 F.3d 174]

the July Agreement without prejudice to, among other things, UPC's “ownership ... of all rights heretofore acquired,”
including those “in or to any ... material furnished or supplied by the Artists.” Id. at 162. In the November Agreement, Abbott
and Costello agreed “to furnish and make available to the Producer all literary and dramatic material and routines heretofore
used by the Artists either on the radio or otherwise and now owned by the Artists,” and acknowledged that “the Producer
shall have the right to use said material and routines to such extent as the Producer may desire in connection with any
photoplay in which the Artists render their services hereunder and in connection with the advertising and exploitation of such
photoplay.” Id. at 129. Abbott and Costello agreed that they would “not use or license, authorize or permit the use of any of
the material and/or routines” so referenced “in connection with motion pictures” by others than UPC for specified times. Id.
Nevertheless, they reserved the right to use materials and routines created by them (without the assistance of UPC writers)
“on the radio and in personal appearances.” Id. at 129-30.

2. UPC Registers a Copyright for Tropics

In November 1940, UPC registered a copyright for Tropics with the United States Copyright Office, which it renewed in
December 1967. See id. at 36, 39-40.

3. UPC Uses an Expanded Version of the Routine in The Naughty Nineties and Registers a Copyright for that Movie

In 1945, Abbott and Costello performed an expanded version of Who's on First? in another movie for UPC, The Naughty
Nineties . That version maintains the core of the Routine—with “Who” on first base, “What” on second, and “I Don't Know” on
third—but several new players take the field: left fielder “Why,” center fielder “Because,” pitcher “Tomorrow,” catcher
“Today,” and shortstop “I Don't Care.”

In June 1945, UPC registered a copyright for The Naughty Nineties with the United States Copyright Office, which it renewed
in 1972. See id. at 37, 41-42; Am. Compl. 4 45. 2

4. The 1944 Copyright Registration for “Abbott and Costello Baseball Routine”

In April 1944, a work entitled “Abbott and Costello Baseball Routine” was registered with the Copyright Office “in the name of
Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, c/o Writers War Board.” J.A. 114. The certificate indicates that this “Baseball Routine” was
published on “March 13, 1944” in “ ‘ Soldier Shows ,’ No. 19.” Id. ©The record

[839 F.3d 175]

suggests that this registration was not renewed, prompting the Copyright Office to conclude that the work had entered the
public domain in 1972, and, on that ground, to reject a 1984 application for a derivative work registration filed by the children


--- Page 3 ---
of Abbott and Costello based on the 1944 registration.

5. The 1984 Quitclaim Agreement

Plaintiffs do not rely on the 1944 registration to support their copyright claim here. Rather, they claim to have succeeded to
UPC's copyright interests in the Routine as performed in Tropics and The Naughty Nineties based on a quitclaim agreement
dated March 12, 1984 (the “Quitclaim’).

In the Quitclaim, which was subsequently recorded with the Copyright Office, UPC's successor-in-interest, Universal
Pictures (“Universal”), granted Abbott & Costello Enterprises (“A & C”), a partnership formed by the heirs of Abbott and
Costello, 2 “any and all” of Universal's rights, title, and interest in the Routine. Id. at 45. Universal stated that it did so relying
upon A & C's representation that it was “a partnership composed of the successors in interest to the late Bud Abbott and
Lou Costello” and, therefore, “the owner of copyright in and to the Routine.” Id. at 46.

A & C dissolved in 1992, with 50% of its assets transferred to TCA Television Corporation, a California entity owned by Lou
Costello's heirs, and the other 50% divided evenly between Bud Abbott's heirs, Vickie Abbott Wheeler and Bud Abbott, Jr.
Wheeler would later transfer her 25% interest to a California partnership, Hi Neighbor, and Abbott, Jr. would transfer his
25% interest to Diana Abbott Colton. It is by operation of the Quitclaim and the referenced dissolution and transfer
agreements that plaintiffs TCA Television, Hi Neighbor, and Colton now claim a copyright interest in Who's on First? .

C. Hand to God

As described in the amended complaint, Hand to God (the “Play”) is “a dark comedy about an introverted student in
religious, small-town Texas who finds a creative outlet and a means of communication through a hand puppet, wh[ich] turns
into his evil or devilish persona.” Am. Compl. 4 58. After two successful off-Broadway runs, Hand to God opened to critical
acclaim on Broadway in the spring of 2015. Through press coverage, plaintiffs learned that Hand to God incorporated part of
the Routine in one of its “key scene[s],” without license or permission. Id. at § 63. While the Play was still in previews for its
Broadway opening, plaintiffs sent defendants a cease and desist letter. Defendants’ failure to comply with that request
prompted this lawsuit.

1. The Relevant Scene

Plaintiffs allege that the Play infringes their copyright in the Routine by using its first part—that is, the part pertaining to first
baseman “Who”—in Act I, Scene 2. In that scene, which occurs approximately 15 minutes into the Play, the lead character,
“Jason,” and the girl with whom he is smitten, “Jessica,” have just emerged from the basement of their church, where they
had been participating in a Christian puppet workshop. Jason tries to impress Jessica by using his sock puppet, “Tyrone,” to

[839 F.3d 176]

perform, almost verbatim, a little over a minute of Who's on First? . Jason plays the Bud Abbott role, while Tyrone assumes
Lou Costello's character. &

When Jason somewhat bashfully concludes the “Who” part of the Routine, Jessica compliments him by saying, “That's really
good,” and asks, “Did you come up with that all by yourself[?]” Suppl. App'x 21. When Jason answers, “Yes,” the audience
laughs at what it recognizes as a lie. Id. ; see Am. Compl. § 64. The answer, however, triggers a different response from the
puppet, which, seemingly of its own volition, calls Jason a “Liar,” and states that the comic exchange they just performed is
“a famous routine from the [Flifties.” Suppl. App'x 21. Jason corrects Tyrone, stating that the sketch is from the “Forties.” Id.
Tyrone then insults Jessica, telling her that she would know the Routine's origin if she “weren't so stupid.” Id. Jason and
Jessica each order Tyrone to “shut up” to no effect. Id. at 22. Instead, as the scene continues, Tyrone vulgarly divulges
Jason's physical desire for Jessica. Only after a seeming physical struggle with Tyrone is Jason able to remove the puppet
from his hand and thereby end Tyrone's outburst. Jason tries to apologize to Jessica, but she quickly exits, leaving Jason—
in the words of the stage direction

[839 F.3d 177
—‘[d]efeated by what he cal Jn't defeat.” Id. at 24.

The scene foreshadows darker and more disturbing exchanges between Jason and the puppet that will occur as the Play
proceeds.

2. Promotional Materials

Plaintiffs allege that, in online promotional materials for the Play, defendants used a “video clip” of Jason and his puppet
performing Who's on First? to “stoke interest” in and sell tickets for the Play. Am. Compl. §§ 69, 89. These promotional
materials are not part of the court record.

D. District Court Proceedings

On June 4, 2015, plaintiffs filed this action in the Southern District of New York, claiming both federal and common law
copyright infringement. Defendants promptly moved to dismiss, arguing, inter alia , that (1) plaintiffs did not hold a valid
copyright; (2) the Routine was in the public domain; and (3) Hand to God 's incorporation of the Routine was sufficiently


--- Page 4 ---
transformative to qualify as a permissible fair use, not prohibited infringement.

On December 17, 2015, the district court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss. It declined to do so on either of the first two
grounds argued by defendants, concluding that, at the 12(b)(6) stage, plaintiffs had “sufficiently alleged a continuous chain
of title” to the Routine to survive dismissal. TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 151 F.Supp.3d at 431. Instead, the court
concluded that dismissal was warranted because defendants’ use of Who's on First? in Hand to God was “highly
transformative” and a non-infringing fair use. Id. at 434, 437.

This appeal followed.

Il. Discussion

A. Dismissal Was Not Properly Based on Fair Use
1. Standard of Review

We review de novo a judgment of dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), accepting all factual allegations in the amended
complaint and its incorporated exhibits as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs' favor. See Concord
Assocs., L.P. v. Entm't Props. Tr. , 817 F.3d 46 , 52 (2d Cir. 2016). The challenged dismissal here is based on the district
court's determination that plaintiffs could not succeed on their copyright infringement claim because the Rule 12(b)(6) record
established defendants' fair use defense as a matter of law.

Our review of that decision is necessarily informed by certain basic copyright principles. First, the law affords copyright
protection to promote not simply individual interests, but—in the words of the Constitution—‘the progress of science and
useful arts” for the benefit of society as a whole. U.S. Const. art |, § 8, cl. 8. As the Supreme Court has explained, copyright
protection is based on the “economic philosophy ... that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way
to advance public welfare.” Mazer v. Stein . 347 U.S. 201 , 219, 74 S.Ct. 460 , 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954) . In short, the “monopoly
created by copyright ... rewards the individual author,” but only “in order to benefit the public.” Harper & Row Publishers, Inc.
v. Nation Enters. , 471 U.S. 539 , 546, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Fox
Film Corp. v. Doyal , 286 U.S. 123, 127,52 S.Ct. 546 , 76 L.Ed. 1010 (1932) (‘The sole interest of the United States and
the primary object in conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors.”).

[839 F.3d 178]

Second, and consistent with this public purpose, the law has long recognized that “some opportunity for fair use of
copyrighted materials” is necessary to promote progress in science and art. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music. Inc. , 510 U.S.
569 , 575,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ; lowa State Univ. Research Found., Inc. v. Am. Broad. Cos. , 621 F.2d
57 , 60 (2d Cir. 1980) (stating that fair use doctrine “permits courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when, on
occasion, it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster”). The doctrine of fair use, derived from
common law, is now codified in the Copyright Act of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541.See 17 U.S.C. § 107. That
codification does not so much define “fair use” as provide a non-exhaustive list of factors to guide courts' fair use
determinations. This affords the doctrine a certain “malleability” that can challenge judicial application. 4 Melville B. Nimmer
& David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright (hereinafter “Nimmer”) § 13.05, at 13-156 (Matthew Bender, rev. ed., 2016).

Courts most frequently address a proffered fair use defense at summary judgment. See, e.g. , Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d
244 , 250 (2d Cir. 2006) (explaining that court may resolve fair use question at summary judgment if there are no genuine
issues of fact); see also Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. . 471 U.S. at 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (stating that
appeals court may decide fair use where “district court has found facts sufficient to evaluate each of the statutory factors”).
Nevertheless, this court has acknowledged the possibility of fair use being so clearly established by a complaint as to
support dismissal of a copyright infringement claim.See Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 707 (2d Cir. 2013) (granting
defendant partial summary judgment on fair use and citing approvingly to Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy Partners , 682
F.3d 687 (7th Cir. 2012) (rejecting argument that fair use could not be decided on motion to dismiss)).

On de novo review here, we conclude that defendants’ entitlement to a fair use defense was not so clearly established on
the face of the amended complaint and its incorporated exhibits as to support dismissal.

2. The Statutory Framework for Analyzing Fair Use

In the preamble to 17 U.S.C. § 107, Congress states that “the fair use of a copyrighted work ... for purposes such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research is not
an infringement of copyright.” As the words “such as” indicate, the listing is “illustrative and not limitative.” 17 U.S.C. § 101 ;
see Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. _ 471 U.S. at 561 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . Four nonexclusive factors—
incorporating common law traditions—are properly considered in “determining whether the use made of a work in any
particular case is a fair use.” 17 U.S.C. § 107. These statutory factors are as follows:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and


--- Page 5 ---
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

Id. ; see generally Folsom v. Marsh , 9 F.Cas. 342, 348 (C.C.D. Mass. 1841) (Story, J.) (explaining that common law courts

[839 F.3d 179]

“deciding questions of this sort” should “look to the nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value of the
materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of
the original work’).

In reviewing the challenged determination of fair use in this case, we necessarily discuss these factors individually, at the
same time that we heed the Supreme Court's instruction that the factors must be viewed collectively, with their results
“weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.” Campbell v. Acuff—Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct.
1164.

a. Purpose and Character of the Use

(1) Transformative Use

The first statutory fair use factor considers the purpose and character of the secondary use. In this regard, the uses
identified by Congress in the preamble to § 107—criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research—
might be deemed “most appropriate” for a purpose or character finding indicative of fair use. Nimmer § 13.05[A][1][a], at 13—
162; see Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 215 (2d Cir. 2015) (noting that providing commentary or criticism on
another's work is “[a]Jmong the best recognized justifications for copying”).

The challenged use here does not appear to fit within any of these statutory categories. Nevertheless, the district court
concluded that defendants’ use was “transformative,” indeed, so “highly transformative” as to be “determinative” of fair use.
TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 151 F.Supp.3d at 434-35. The district court explained that by having a single character
perform the Routine, the Play's authors were able to contrast “Jason's seemingly soft-spoken personality and the actual
outrageousness of his inner nature, which he expresses through the sock puppet.” Id. at 436. This contrast was “a darkly
comedic critique of the social norms governing a small town in the Bible Belt.” Id. This reasoning is flawed in that what it
identifies are the general artistic and critical purpose and character of the Play . The district court did not explain how
defendants’ extensive copying of a famous comedy routine was necessary to this purpose, much less how the character of
the Routine was transformed by defendants' use.

The Supreme Court has stated that “the goal of copyright ... is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works.”
Campbell v. Acuff—Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . 2But

[839 F.3d 180]

how does a court decide “whether and to what extent the new work is ‘transformative’ ”? Id. Campbell instructs that a court
properly considers “whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something
new , with a further purpose or different character , altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message .” Id.
(emphases added) (alterations, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).

As the highlighted language indicates, the focus of inquiry is not simply on the new work, i.e. , on whether that work serves a
purpose or conveys an overall expression, meaning, or message different from the copyrighted material it appropriates.
Rather, the critical inquiry is whether the new work uses the copyrighted material itself for a purpose, or imbues it with a
character, different from that for which it was created. See id. Otherwise, any play that needed a character to sing a song, tell
a joke, or recite a poem could use unaltered copyrighted material with impunity, so long as the purpose or message of the
play was different from that of the appropriated material.

In sum, even if, as the district court concluded, Hand to God is a “darkly comedic critique of the social norms governing a
small town in the Bible Belt,” TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 151 F.Supp.3d at 436, and even if the Play's purpose and
character are completely different from the vaudevillian humor originally animating Who's on First? , that, by itself, does not
demonstrate that defendants’ use of the Routine in the Play was transformative of the original work.

We made this point in Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694. There, the defendant, a self-styled “appropriation artist,”id. at 699,
had taken plaintiff's copyrighted photographs—“serene and deliberately composed” portraits of Rastafarian men—and
altered them to create “crude and jarring” collages, id. at 706. Defendant acknowledged that he had not used the
photographs to “comment on” the original works. Id. at 707. Instead, both works had an underlying artistic purpose, but
defendant stated that he had sought to change the original material “into something that's completely different.” Id. (internal
quotation marks omitted). Reversing a district court award of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff, this court ruled that,
although commentary frequently constitutes fair use, it is not essential that a new creative work comment on an incorporated
copyrighted work to be transformative. See id. at 706. 12 Rather, “to qualify as a fair use” in the absence of such a different
purpose, the new work “generally must alter the original with ‘new expression, meaning, or message.’ ” Id. (quoting
Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music. Inc. . 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). 14

[839 F.3d 181]


--- Page 6 ---
Cariou concluded that the challenged artworks there satisfied this standard because they not only strove for “new aesthetics
with creative and communicative results distinct from” that of the copyrighted material, but also gave the incorporated
photographs “new expression,” thereby admitting a transformative purpose. Id. at 708. Indeed, where the defendant's use so
“heavily obscured and altered” the original photographs as to make them “barely recognizable” within the new work, the
court ruled that transformative purpose (and ultimately fair use) was established as a matter of law. Id. at 710. But where
lesser changes retained certain of the original work's aesthetics, the court could not say “for sure” that their incorporation
into the defendant's works had “transformed [the original] work enough to render it transformative.” Id. at 711. As to those
works, Cariou remanded for further proceedings. Id.

Insofar as Cariou might be thought to represent the high-water mark of our court's recognition of transformative works, it has
drawn some criticism.See Kienitz v. Sconnie Nation LLC , 766 F.3d 756 , 758 (7th Cir. 2014) (expressing skepticism as to
Cariou 's approach and criticizing reliance on transformativeness as substitute for the statutory factors, which threatens to
override the copyright owner's exclusive right to prepare derivative works); see also Nimmer § 13.05[B][6], at 13.224.20
(stating with respect to Cariou : “It would seem that the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of recognizing any
alteration as transformative, such that this doctrine now threatens to swallow fair use. It is respectfully submitted that a
correction is needed in the law.”). We need not defend Cariou here, however, because our point is that even scrupulous
adherence to that decision does not permit defendants' use of Who's on First? in Hand to God to be held transformative.

Far from altering Who's on First? to the point where it is “barely recognizable” within the Play, Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d at
710 , defendants' use appears not to have altered the Routine at all. The Play may convey a dark critique of society, but it
does not transform Abbott and Costello's Routine so that it conveys that message. To the contrary, it appears that the Play
specifically has its characters perform Who's on First? without alteration so that the audience will readily recognize both the
amous Routine and the boy's false claim to having created it. Indeed, it is only after Who's on First? is performed—at some
length, almost verbatim, and with the Play's characters mimicking the original

839 F.3d 182]

iming, tone, and delivery of Abbott and Costello—that the boy's lie about creating the classic Routine—no part of the
Routine—becomes the triggering event for the puppet to assume an independent persona.

Defendants nevertheless maintain that using the Routine for such a “dramatic,” rather than comedic, purpose was
ransformative. Appellees Br. 18 (stating that Play's use of Routine was “far cry” from original “comedy schtick ”). The
argument will not bear close scrutiny. The “dramatic” purpose served by the Routine in the Play appears to be as a
“McGuffin,” that is, as a theatrical device that sets up the plot, but is of little or no significance in itself. 12 To advance the plot
of the Play, specifically, to have the puppet Tyrone take on a persona distinct from that of Jason, defendants needed Jason
0 lie about something and for Tyrone to call him on it. But the particular subject of the lie—the Routine—appears irrelevant
‘o that purpose. Such unaltered use of an allegedly copyrighted work, having no bearing on the original work, requires
justification to qualify for a fair use defense. See Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. _ 804 F.3d at 215 (stating that “taking from
another author's work for the purpose of making points that have no bearing on the original may well be fair use, but the
‘aker would need to show a justification’).

More than the Routine's ability to capture audience attention is necessary to provide such justification. As the Supreme
Court has cautioned, where a secondary use “has no critical bearing on the substance or style of the original composition,
which the alleged infringer merely uses to get attention ..., the claim to fairness in borrowing from another's work diminishes
accordingly (if it does not vanish).” Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. 510 U.S. at 580 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Nor is a different
conclusion warranted because defendants here place the unaltered Routine in a sharply different context from its original
authors. See id. at 598, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (observing that courts should not afford fair use protection
to persons who merely place characters from familiar copyrighted works into novel or eccentric settings).

The fact that, even as a McGuffin, the Routine is quite funny, also cannot justify its use in the Play. That humor is an
achievement of the Routine's creators, not of the playwright who takes advantage of it without transforming the Routine's
aesthetic. Moreover, the Play appropriates the Routine's humor not incidentally, but extensively by having the characters
perform some dozen of the original exchanges on the comic ambiguity of the words “who's on first.” No new dramatic
purpose was served by so much copying. Cf. Campbell v. Acuff—Rose Music, Inc. . 510 U.S. at 589 , 114 S.Ct. 1164
(concluding that copying of song for parodic purpose was fair where it was not “excessive” in relation to that purpose as
secondary user took only what was necessary to evoke original). The only purpose served by the extent of defendants’
taking is identically comedic to that of the original authors, that is, to have two performers expand on a singular joke in order
to generate increasing audience laughter. As this court has recognized, there is “nothing transformative” about using

[839 F.3d 183]

an original work “in the manner it was made to be” used._On Davis v. Gap, Inc. , 246 F.3d 152, 174 (2d Cir. 2001) ;see
Ringgold v. Black Entm't Television, Inc. , 126 F.3d 70, 79 (2d Cir. 1997) (concluding that purpose factor favored copyright
owner where defendant used “work for precisely a central purpose for which it was created”). Defendants’ use of the
Routine, not briefly as the basis for a dramatic lie, but extensively for its original comedic effect, cannot be deemed
transformative.

In sum, nothing in the 12(b)(6) record shows that the Play imbued the Routine with any new expression, meaning, or
message. Nor does any new dramatic purpose justify defendants’ extensive copying of the Routine. Accordingly, the district
court erred both in finding defendants’ use of the Routine transformative and in concluding, on that basis, that a fair use


--- Page 7 ---
defense was established as a matter of law. 18

(2) Commercial Purpose

The first statutory factor specifically instructs courts to consider whether copyrighted materials are used for a commercial
purpose or for a nonprofit educational purpose, the former tending “to weigh against a finding of fair use.” Campbell v.
Acuff—Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. at 585 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is no question here that
defendants’ use of Who's on First? in Hand to God was for a commercial purpose. Nevertheless, the district court discounted
that fact upon finding the use “highly transformative.” TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 151 F.Supp.3d at 434-35 ;see
Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. . 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (recognizing that “the more transformative the new
work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use”).
Because we here conclude that defendants' use was not transformative, let alone “highly transformative,” we conclude that
the district court erred in discounting Hand to God 's commercial character. See Campbell v. Acuff—Rose Music, Inc. . 510
U.S. at 579 -81, 114 S.Ct. 1164 .14

This conclusion applies with particular force here where plaintiffs allege that defendants not only used an unaltered and

appreciable excerpt of the Routine in a commercial play but also featured the Routine in the Play's advertising, conduct

which reasonably qualifies as commercial exploitation weighing strongly against fair use. See id. at 585, 114 S.Ct. 1164

(observing that use of copyrighted work “to advertise a product, even in a parody, will be entitled to less indulgence under

the first factor of the fair use enquiry than the sale of a parody for its own sake”); American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.
60 F.3d 913 , 922 (2d Cir. 1994) (stating that fair use claim will not be sustained when secondary use can fairly be

[839 F.3d 184]

characterized as “commercial exploitation” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Consumers Union of U.S.. Inc. v. Gen. Signal
Corp. , 724 F.2d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 1983) (observing that some infringement actions involve copying of creative
expression for “purpose of having that precise form of expression advance someone else's commercial interests—for
example, using well-known copyrighted lines to attract attention to an advertisement”). Indeed, to the extent defendants
excessively copied from the Routine even within the Play, their advertising focus on the Routine's comic exchanges raises
particular commercial exploitation concerns.

Thus, defendants' commercial use of the Routine was not transformative. Rather, it duplicated to a significant degree the
comedic purpose of the original work. As such, the first statutory factor, far from weighing in defendants’ favor, weighs in
favor of plaintiffs.

b. Nature of Copyrighted Work

The second statutory factor, “the nature of the copyrighted work,” also weighs in plaintiffs’ favor. As the Supreme Court has
observed, certain “works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with the consequence that fair
use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied.” Campbell v. Acuff—Rose Music, Inc. . 510 U.S. at 586 ,
114 S.Ct. 1164 . Like the district court, we conclude thatWho's on First? , an original comedy sketch created for public
entertainment, lies at the heart of copyright's intended protection. See id. (recognizing that creative expression created for
public dissemination is at core of “copyright's protective purposes”); On Davis v. Gap, Inc. , 246 F.3d at 175 (concluding that
second factor favored plaintiff because copyrighted work was “in the nature of an artistic creation”). Thus, while the
secondary user of noncreative information can more readily claim fair use based on the law's recognition of “a greater need
to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy,” Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. . 471 U.S. at
563 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; see Authors Guild v. Google. Inc. , 804 F.3d at 220 & n.21 (explaining that factual works “often
present well justified fair uses” because “there is often occasion to test the accuracy of, to rely on, or to repeat their factual
propositions,” which “may reasonably require quotation”), the secondary user of a creative work must justify his use, usually
by explaining the functional or creative rationale behind its quotation, see Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard , 103
Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1113 (1990) (explaining that, in considering whether quotation is fair, courts must consider utility of each
challenged passage).

Defendants argue that their use was justified by the dramatic need to use an instantly recognizable “cultural” touchstone in
the relevant scene. Appellees’ Br. 15. Defendants do not explain, however, why Jason's lie had to pertain to a cultural
touchstone, as opposed to any obvious tall tale—e.g. , inventing the Internet, traveling to Mars, out-swimming Michael
Phelps. See generally Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard , 103 Harv. L. Rev. at 1111 (observing that court considering fair
use must determine not only if justification for copying exists, but also “how powerful, or persuasive, is the justification”). But
even assuming defendants’ professed dramatic need, they do not explain why the cultural touchstone had to be the Routine
—or even a comedy sketch—as opposed to some other readily recognizable exchange, including those already in the public
domain. Most troubling, even if defendants could justify their dramatic need to use a small, identifiable segment of the
Routine, that does not justify having their characters perform,

[839 F.3d 185]

verbatim, some dozen variations on the Routine's singular joke. As already noted, the purpose of such extensive use was to
provoke audience laughter in exactly the same way as the Routine's creators had done.

In sum, because defendants’ use of the Routine cannot be deemed transformative, and because the record is devoid of any
persuasive justification for the extent of defendants’ use, the creative nature of the Routine weighs strongly against a fair


--- Page 8 ---
use defense.

c. Amount and Substantiality of Use

The third statutory factor asks whether “ ‘the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work
as a whole’ ... are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.” Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music. Inc. . 510 U.S. at
586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 107(3) ). In assessing this factor, we consider not only “the quantity of the
materials used” but also “their quality and importance.” Id. at 587, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; see Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v.
Nation Enters. , 471 U.S. at 565, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (stating that “fact that a substantial portion of the infringing work was
copied verbatim is evidence of the qualitative value of the copied material, both to the originator and to the plagiarist who
seeks to profit from marketing someone else's copyrighted expression’).

While acknowledging that the portion of the Routine used by defendants was “instantly recognizable” and “more than merely
the ‘introductory premise,’ ” the district court decided—without explanation—that this factor tipped only “slightly” in plaintiffs’
favor in light of defendants’ transformative use. TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 151 F.Supp.3d at 434. We reject the
district court's transformative use determination for reasons already explained. On de novo review, we further conclude that
the third statutory factor weighs strongly in favor of plaintiffs.

While the portion of the Routine copied by defendants takes less than two minutes to perform, it plainly reveals the singular
joke underlying the entire Routine: that words understood by one person as a question can be understood by another as an
answer. Moreover, defendants repeatedly exploit that joke through a dozen variations. This manifests substantial copying.
See Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. . 471 U.S. at 548, 565-66, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (concluding that third factor
favored plaintiffs where defendants copied approximately 300 words verbatim in light of “expressive value of the excerpts”);
Castle Rock Entm't v. Caro! Publ'g Grp.. Inc. , 955 F.Supp. 260 , 269 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (citing Harper & Row as support for
proposition that copying even few words of challenged work can constitute substantial taking if it amounts to taking heart of
original work), affid , 150 F.3d 132 (2d Cir. 1998) .

Even a substantial taking, however, can constitute fair use if justified. See Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust 755 F.3d 87 , 98
(2d Cir. 2014) (acknowledging that some purposes require copying entirety of copyrighted work); see also Leval, Toward a
Fair Use Standard , 103 Harv. L. Rev. at 1123 (explaining that, under third factor, “an important inquiry is whether the
selection and quantity of the material taken are reasonable in relation to the purported justification”). But, as already
explained, defendants offer no persuasive justification for their extensive use of the Routine. Cf. Authors Guild, Inc. v.
HathiTrust , 755 F.3d at 98 (stating that “crux” of third factor inquiry is whether “no more was taken than necessary” (internal
quotation marks omitted)).

[839 F.3d 186]

d. Effect on Potential Market for Copyrighted Work

The final statutory factor considers “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work,” 17
U.S.C. § 107(4), focusing on whether the secondary use usurps demand for the protected work by serving as a market
substitute, see Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. at 592 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (stating that role of courts is to
distinguish between “biting criticism that merely suppresses demand and copyright infringement, which usurps it” (alterations
and internal quotation marks omitted)). In weighing this factor, a court properly looks to “not only the extent of market harm
caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort
engaged in by the defendant would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original.” Id. at
590, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).

The district court weighed this factor in defendants' favor, concluding that the Play's use of the Routine could not reasonably
be expected to usurp the market for Abbott and Costello's original performance. See TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum ,
151 F.Supp.3d at 434-35. In so doing, however, the district court disregarded the possibility of defendants' use adversely
affecting the licensing market for the Routine. See id. at 434 (citing Cariou v. Prince . 714 F.3d at 708 (stating that fourth
actor “does not focus principally on the question of damage to [a] derivative market’).

While derivative markets are not the principal focus of the fourth inquiry, that does not mean that they are irrelevant. See
Campbell v. Acuff—Rose Music, Inc. . 510 U.S. at 593 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (recognizing that evidence of substantial harm to
derivative market would weigh against fair use). A court considering fair use properly identifies and weighs relevant harm to
he derivative market for a copyrighted work, which market includes uses that creators of original works might “license others
(0 develop.” Id. at 592, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; see American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc. , 60 F.3d at 929(‘[T]he impact on
potential licensing revenues is a proper subject for consideration in assessing the fourth factor.”).

To be clear, in assessing harm posed to a licensing market, a court's focus is not on possible lost licensing fees from
defendants’ challenged use. See American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc. , 60 F.3d at 929n.17 (explaining that fourth
actor would always favor copyright owner if courts focused on loss of potential licensing fees from alleged infringer); see
also Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard , 103 Harv. L. Rev. at 1124 (“By definition every fair use involves some loss of
royalty revenue because the secondary user has not paid royalties.”). Rather, a court properly considers the challenged
use's “impact on potential licensing revenues for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets.” American
Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc. , 60 F.3d at 930; accord Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. . 756 F.3d 73,
91 (2d Cir. 2014).



--- Page 9 ---
Plaintiffs here alleged the existence of a traditional—and active—derivative market for licensing the Routine. See Am.
Compl. {4 40, 81-83 (alleging that plaintiffs receive “regular” requests to license Who's on First? , which they frequently
grant). Further, they alleged market harm. See id. at 4 83 (alleging that defendants' unlicensed use of Who's on First?
negatively affected commercial market for future licensing). Accepting these allegations as true at this

[839 F.3d 187]

stage of the litigation, we conclude that this factor weighs in favor of plaintiffs_See On Davis v. Gap, Inc. , 246 F.3d at 175—
76 (concluding that fourth factor favored copyright owner where defendants’ taking caused both loss of royalty revenue and
“diminution of [owner's] opportunity to license to others who might regard [owner's] design as preempted by [defendant's]
ad”).

In sum, on the 12(b)(6) record, all four statutory factors weigh in favor of plaintiffs and against a defense of fair use.
Because, at this stage of the proceeding, defendants have identified no other equitable factors as here relevant to the fair
use analysis, we conclude that the dismissal of plaintiffs' amended complaint on the ground of fair use was error.
Nevertheless, for reasons explained in the next section of the opinion, we conclude that dismissal was warranted because
plaintiffs did not plausibly allege a valid copyright interest in the Routine.

B. Dismissal for Failure To Plead a Valid Copyright

Defendants argue that, even if we reject dismissal on the basis of a fair use defense, we should affirm because plaintiffs fail
plausibly to plead ownership of a valid copyright in the Routine. See Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. 340
, 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (identifying two elements of infringement: (1) ownership of valid copyright
and (2) copying original elements of work). Defendants assert that Abbott and Costello's Who's on First? Routine fell into the
public domain in 1968, when the initial copyright term for Tropics expired. Defendants concede that UPC's registration for
that movie protected the Routine—first published therein—from entering the public domain through the term of that
copyright, see Shoptalk, Ltd. v. Concorde—New Horizons Corp. . 168 F.3d 586 , 592 (2d Cir. 1999), but they assert that only
Abbott and Costello, as the Routine's authors, could renew the copyright in that work—as distinct from Tropics —which the
team failed to do. 15

In disputing this challenge, plaintiffs argue that UPC had the right to renew the copyright in the Routine because (1) Abbott
and Costello assigned ownership of their common law copyright in the Routine to UPC in either the July or November
Agreement, (2) the Routine as published in Tropics was a “work for hire” owned by UPC, and (3) the Routine merged into
Tropics so as to support a single copyright. Plaintiffs maintain that, under any of these theories, UPC's renewal of the
Tropics copyright also maintained copyright protection for the Routine, so that they now hold a valid copyright in that work by
virtue of UPC's transfer of its rights in the Routine in the Quitclaim.

We identify no merit in any of the theories relied on by plaintiffs to support their copyright claim and, accordingly, we affirm
dismissal of the amended complaint for failure to plead a valid copyright.

1. Copyright Assignment

In rejecting defendants’ copyright invalidity challenge, the district court thought that “[t]he contract language, together with
UPC's subsequent registration

[839 F.3d 188]

of the copyrights” for Tropics and The Naughty Nineties , might admit a finding of “implied assignment of the initial copyright
from Abbott and Costello.” TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 151 F.Supp.3d at 429 ;see Nimmer § 10.03[B][2], at 10—
56.2(6) (explaining that pre-1978 assignment of common law copyright could be effectuated orally or implied from conduct).
The conclusion is flawed in two respects. First, as detailed in this section, the July and November Agreements clearly
express the parties’ intent for Abbott and Costello to license the use of, not to assign copyrights in, their existing comedy
routines for use in UPC movies in which the team appeared. Second, and requiring no further discussion in the face of clear
contract language, UPC's registration (and renewal) of copyrights in its movies says nothing about what Abbott and Costello
intended to convey in the two agreements because UPC would have taken such action to protect its independent movie
rights in any event. See generally Faulkner v. Nat'| Geographic Soc'y , 220 F.Supp.2d 237 , 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (noting that
under 1909 Copyright Act, proprietor of collective work had right to renew copyright in collective work itself).

Turning then to the agreements, we note at the outset that neither contract has a choice of law provision. Thus, the
controlling law would be the contract's “center of gravity,” which typically is the place of contracting or performance. Lazard
Freres & Co. v. Protective Life Ins. Co. , 108 F.3d 1531 , 1539 (2d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). The July
Agreement was executed in New York with expected performance in California. The November Agreement was also to be
performed in California and may have been executed there, where UPC was located and Abbott and Costello were then
completing Tropics . Any uncertainty on the latter point is irrelevant, however, because New York and California law both
instruct that contracts must be interpreted according to the mutual intent of the parties at the time the contract was formed.
See Welsbach Elec. Corp. v. MasTec N. Am.., Inc. , 7 N.Y.3d 624 , 629, 825 N.Y.S.2d 692 , 695, 859 N.E.2d 498 (2006) ;
AlU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court , 51 Cal.3d 807 , 821,274 Cal.Rptr. 820 , 799 P.2d 1253 , 1264 (1990). Both states recognize
that the best evidence of the parties’ intent is the language used in their contract. See Brad H. v. City of New York , 17
N.Y.3d 180 , 185,928 N.Y.S.2d 221 , 224,951 N.E.2d 743 (2011) ; AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court , 51 Cal.3d at 822 , 274
Cal.Rptr. 820 , 799 P.2d at 1264 . Thus, where contract language is clear and unambiguous, courts will enforce an



--- Page 10 ---
agreement according to its terms, without looking outside the four corners of the document._See Brad H. v. City of New York
.17N.Y.3d at 185 , 928 N.Y.S.2d at 224 , 951 N.E.2d 743 ; AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court , 51 Cal.3d at 822 , 274 Cal.Roptr.
820 , 799 P.2d at 1264 .

The July Agreement employing Abbott and Costello for “one feature photoplay,” J.A. 165, states that the team would furnish
UPC with “routines heretofore used and now owned by Artists for use by the Producer in the photoplay in which they appear
hereunder and for which the Producer shall have the exclusive motion picture rights ,” id. at 169 (emphases added). The
longer-term November Agreement similarly states that the team would furnish UPC with all “routines heretofore used by the
Artists either on the radio or otherwise and now owned by the Artists,” and that UPC would “have the right to use said
material and routines to such extent as the Producer may desire in connection with any photoplay in which the Artists render
their services hereunder .” Id. at 129 (emphases added). As the highlighted

[839 F.3d 189]

language in each agreement makes plain, Abbott and Costello furnished UPC with their routines for a limited purpose: use
in any movies in which the team appeared under the respective agreements. 18This is unmistakably the language of an
exclusive, limited-use license, not the assignment of copyright. See Compendium of Copyright Office Practices § 12.2.1
(1973) (stating that license is “exclusive or non-exclusive grant of permission to use a copyrighted work for certain
purposes’).

A clause in the July Agreement granting UPC “all rights of every kind and character whatsoever in and to the same ...
perpetually” warrants no different conclusion. J.A. 169. This language appears in the same sentence as that quoted in the
preceding paragraph and, thus, “all rights ... in and to the same” can only be understood to reference UPC's motion picture
rights, not the team's common law copyright in its routines. 14Indeed, in the November Agreement, wherein the team grants
UPC the right to photograph and reproduce their “acts,” the “perpetual” right “to use the same” is expressly granted “only in
connection with the photoplays in which the Artists appear hereunder and in connection with the advertising and exploitation
hereof.” Id. at 127. The November Agreement states that “the Producer shall not have the right to use the Artists’ names or
likenesses or reproductions of their voices in radio broadcasts (except as hereinafter expressly permitted) independent of ...
motion picture productions or in commercial tie-ups.” Id. at 128.

Other language in the November Agreement further confirms that Abbott and Costello granted UPC only a license to use
heir routines. The team therein agreed “that they w[ould] not use or license, authorize or permit the use of any of the
material and/or routines” furnished to UPC under the agreement “in connection with motion pictures for any person, firm or
corporation other than the Producer, at any time prior to the termination of the employment of the Artists under this
agreement or one year after the general release of the photoplay in which used, whichever is later.” Id. at 129. The fact that
he Agreement limits Abbott and Costello's ability to use or license specified material (i.e. , material created before the
agreements) only “in connection with motion pictures,” and only for a limited time, plainly indicates the parties' understanding
hat the team retained ownership of the copyright in their pre-agreement material and granted UPC only a license. See P.C.
Films Corp. v. MGM/UA Home Video Inc. , 138 F.3d 453 , 456 (2d Cir. 1998) (explaining that under 1909 Copyright Act,
“transfer of anything less than the totality of rights commanded by copyright was automatically a license rather than an
assignment [of] the copyright’).

Thus, the language of the July and November Agreements, by itself, clearly belies plaintiffs' claim that Abbott and Costello
therein conveyed their common law copyright in the Routine to UPC. That conclusion is reinforced by the very Quitclaim on
which plaintiffs’ claimed ownership of the Who's on First? copyright depends. To secure the Quitclaim of UPC's

[839 F.3d 190]

interests in the Routine (then held by its successor, Universal), plaintiffs’ predecessors-in-interest therein represented that
they owned the copyright in the Routine. In short, the parties to the Quitclaim understood Abbott and Costello not to have
transferred, but to have retained, ownership of the Routine's copyright.

Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot state a plausible infringement claim based on a 1940 transfer of copyright ownership from
Abbott and Costello to UPC in either the July or November Agreement. The record does not support such assignment. 18

2. Work Made for Hire

Plaintiffs maintain that, even if the July and November Agreements cannot be construed to have assigned copyrights, they
are work-for-hire agreements. They argue that UPC, “[a]s the author under a work-for-hire agreement of the films ...,
properly registered its copyright in these two films with the Copyright Office, and thereafter timely renewed their copyright
registrations.” Appellants' Br. 9; see Estate of Burne Hogarth v. Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. , 342 F.3d 149, 156-57 (2d Cir.
2003) (explaining that, under 1909 Copyright Act, employer was legal author and, therefore, had renewal rights).

The argument is defeated by plaintiffs' own allegation—which we must accept as true—that the Routine was first performed
in March 1938, more than two years before Abbott and Costello entered into the July and November Agreements with UPC.
See Am. Compl. { 32. Insofar as Abbott and Costello had already performed Who's on First? in 1938, they plainly did not
create the Routine at UPC's “instance and expense” in 1940, as would be required for it to be a work-for-hire. Playboy
Enters.. Inc. v. Dumas , 53 F.3d 549 , 554 (2d Cir. 1995) (stating that work is considered “for hire” when made at hiring
party's instance and expense, i.e. , “when the motivating factor in producing the work was the employer who induced the
creation” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Urantia Found. v. Maaherra . 114 F.3d 955 , 961 (9th Cir. 1997) (“An



--- Page 11 ---
employment (or commissioning) relationship at the time the work is created is a condition for claiming renewal as the
proprietor of a work made for hire.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Plaintiffs seek to avoid this conclusion by noting defendants’ (1) concession—at least for purposes of their motion to dismiss
—that new material was added to the Routine for Tropics , see TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 151 F.Supp.3d at 431 ;
and (2) failure to establish “the contents, language or scope of protectable expression of the 1938 radio broadcast,”
Appellants' Reply Br. 22. We are not persuaded.

On review of a motion to dismiss, courts must draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs’ favor. Even applying that principle
here, it is not plausible to infer that the Routine, as performed in 1938, did not already contain the initial series of exchanges
about a person named “Who” playing first base for the simple reason that there is no Routine without at least that part.
Further, because that is the part of the Routine appropriated in Hand to God , plaintiffs must plausibly allege a valid
copyright in that material, regardless of later additions. Thus, to the extent plaintiffs' copyright claim rests on a theory of
work-for-hire, it was their burden to plead facts showing that the appropriated parts

[839 F.3d 191]

of the Routine had not existed in the 1938 iteration of Who's on First? , but were first created for Tropics so as to be covered
by the copyright and copyright renewal of that movie. See Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. at 361,111
S.Ct. 1282 (stating that to establish infringement claim, plaintiff must demonstrate, among other things, ownership of valid
copyright).

3. Merger of Routine in Motion Pictures

Finally, plaintiffs argue that even if their copyright ownership claim cannot rest on either an assignment or work-for-hire
theory, it is plausible because “so much of the Routine as was used in the Movies ‘merged’ with the Movies to become a
‘unitary whole.’ ” See Appellants’ Reply Br. 28. Thus, the Routine was not separately registerable; rather it was protected by
UPC's statutory registration and its renewal of the copyrights for movies using the Routine.

This argument also fails because, as this court recently observed, “authors of freestanding works that are incorporated into a
film ... may copyright these ‘separate and independent works.’ ” 16 Casa Duse, LLC v. Merkin , 791 F.3d 247 , 259 (2d Cir.
2015) (emphasis added) (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 101 ); see id. at 257 (noting that separate copyrights may be necessary where
motion picture incorporates “separate, freestanding pieces that independently constitute ‘works of authorship’ ”). Who's on
First? was such a freestanding work within Tropics . As already noted, plaintiffs acknowledged in the amended complaint
that the Routine (1) was prepared and existed on its own for some years before it was performed in Tropics , see Am.
Compl. 4 32; and (2) was performed independently from the films “thousands of times” on the radio and elsewhere, see id. at
{1 34-35; see also J.A. 129 (stating in November Agreement that “Artists reserve the right to use on the radio and in
personal appearances” all preexisting routines). The Quitclaim representation that plaintiffs' predecessors-in-interest still
owned the Routine's copyright in 1984 is also at odds with the argument that the Routine had so merged with Tropics as to
admit a single copyright owned by UPC.

Neither Garcia v. Google, Inc. , 786 F.3d 733 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc ), nor Richlin v. Metro—Goldwyn—Mayer Pictures, Inc.
531 F.3d 962 (9th Cir. 2008) , relied on by plaintiffs, is to the contrary. InGarcia , the Ninth Circuit reversed a panel decision
holding that an actor's five-second contribution to a movie was sufficiently creative to entitle her to register a copyright in her
performance. The en banc court explained that “[t]reating every acting performance as an independent work” would be a
“logistical and financial nightmare.” Garcia v. Google, Inc. _ 786 F.3d at 743. This case is not analogous. While the screen
actor's performance there was so “integrated into” the filmed work as to be “inseparable from” it, see 16 Casa Duse, LLC v.
Merkin , 791 F.3d at 254, Who's on First? is a freestanding comedy routine performed by Abbott and Costello not only years
before the first frame of Tropics was ever filmed but also for many years thereafter. Thus, the concerns at issue in Garcia are
not present here.

As for Richlin , the Ninth Circuit did not there hold, as plaintiffs contend, that an author is hot entitled to an independent
copyright by reason of inclusion of his [story] treatment's material in [a] motion picture.” Appellants’ Reply Br. 27-28
(emphasis in original). Rather, the court there assumed that plaintiffs' story treatment was independently copyrightable when
it held that plaintiffs had “failed to secure a federal copyright for it.”

[839 F.3d 192]

Richlin v. Metro-Goldwyn—Mayer Pictures, Inc. . 531 F.3d at 976 . Thus, the court acknowledged that “publication of a
motion picture with notice secures federal statutory copyright protection for all of its component parts,” but observed “that
does not mean that the component parts necessarily each secure an independent federal statutory copyright.” Id. at 975-76.
The movie's publication protected so much of the treatment as was disclosed therein, but it “did not constitute publication of
the Treatment ‘as such’—i.e., as a work standing alone.” Id. at 973.

This reasoning undermines rather than supports plaintiffs' merger theory. The plaintiffs in Richlin “clearly intended” that the
treatment “be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.” Id. at 967. That is not this case. As
already explained, the Routine was created and performed by Abbott and Costello well before Tropics was filmed, and the
team continued to perform it for years after. Indeed, the Agreements’ licensing of the Routine's performance in Tropics and
The Naughty Nineties contemplated such independent performances. In these circumstances, we conclude that the Routine
did not merge into UPC's films so as to avoid the need for its creators to renew the copyright. See 16 Casa Duse, LLC v.



--- Page 12 ---
Merkin , 791 F.3d at 259.

In sum, because plaintiffs fail plausibly to allege that (1) Abbott and Costello assigned their common law copyright in Who's
on First? to UPC; (2) the Routine, as appropriated by defendants in Hand to God , was first created for UPC as a work-for-
hire; or (3) the Routine so merged with the UPC movies in which it was performed as to become a unitary whole, we
conclude that plaintiffs did not plead their possession of a valid copyright in the Routine, as required to pursue their
infringement claim.

Accordingly, even though the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs' amended complaint based on defendants’ fair use of
the appropriated material, we affirm dismissal based on plaintiffs’ failure plausibly to allege a valid copyright.

Ill. Conclusion
To summarize, we conclude as follows:
1. Dismissal was not supported by fair use because all four relevant factors weigh in plaintiffs’ favor:

a. Defendants’ verbatim use of over a minute of Who's on First? in their commercial production, Hand to God ,
was not transformative because defendants neither used so much of the Routine for a different purpose nor
imbued the original with a different message, meaning, or expression;

b. Defendants failed persuasively to justify their use of the Routine, as a secondary user who appropriates a
creative work without alteration must do;

c. Defendants’ use of some dozen of the Routine's variations of “who's on first” was excessive in relation to any
dramatic purpose; and

d. Plaintiffs allege an active secondary market for the work, which was not considered by the district court.

2. Dismissal is warranted by plaintiffs’ failure plausibly to plead ownership of a valid copyright. Their efforts to do so on
theories of assignment, work-for-hire, and merger all fail as a matter of law.

Accordingly, the judgment of dismissal is AFFIRMED.

Notes:

1 Defendants do not cross-appeal the district court's denial of dismissal on the ground of copyright invalidity; rather, they argue it as an alternative ground
for affirmance, even if plaintiffs’ fair use challenge prevails. In this opinion, we first address plaintiffs’ challenge to the fair use determination supporting
dismissal because if we were to identify no error in that ruling there would be no need to consider defendants’ proposed alternative ground for affirmance.

2 In 1999, Timemagazine named the Routine the best comedy sketch of the Twentieth Century. SeeAm. Compl. § 37; Best
of the Century, Time, December 31, 1999, at 73.

3 Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the district court discussed in some detail why (1) before Tropics's
release, the Routine was protected by common law copyright; and (2) the movie's release could constitute “publication” of
the Routine, extinguishing any common law right and requiring registration and deposit with the federal Copyright Office to
claim any statutory copyright protection. SeeTCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 151 F.Supp.3d at 427-30.

4 Plaintiffs’ amended complaint cites only the November Agreement with UPC as the relevant contract. SeeAm. Compl. { 43.
By the time that agreement was signed, however, Abbott and Costello presumably had already finished their work on
Tropics—including any additions to the Routine reflected in that movie. Thus, it would appear that the team's work on
Tropicswas pursuant to the July Agreement, discussed supraat |.B.1.a. The discrepancy does not affect our analysis here
because, in the district court, defendants conceded that, at least for purposes of their motion to dismiss, the July Agreement
had “in effect, been pleaded” by plaintiffs in support of their claim. Sept. 9, 2015 Hr'g Tr. 2-3.

5 By operation of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, Pub. L. No. 105-298, 112 Stat. 2827 (1998), the renewal
term for Tropicswill not expire until 2035 and that for The Naughty Ninetieswill not expire until 2040. See17 U.S.C. § 304(b).

&The George Mason University Libraries, in their “Guide to the John C. Becher Soldier Show Collection, 1940-1953,”
indicates that “Soldier Shows” refers to entertainments “made by soldiers for soldiers,” with the object of “mass participation”
to raise morale. J.A. 208-09. Because the record here is devoid of any information about either Soldier Shows generally or
Soldier Shows, No. 19 in particular, we make no assumptions about the content of the material that is the subject of the
1944 copyright registration.

2The idea that “transformative” purpose could support fair use was put forth by our colleague, Judge Leval, in a seminal
article, “Toward a Fair Use Standard.” See103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1111 (1990) ( “[T]he question of justification turns
primarily on whether, and to what extent, the challenged use is transformative. The use must be productive and must employ
the quoted matter in a different manner or for a different purpose from the original. A quotation of copyrighted material that
merely repackages or republishes the original is unlikely to pass the test... If, on the other hand, the secondary use adds
value to the original—if the quoted matter is used as raw material, transformed in the creation of new information, new
aesthetics, new insights and understandings—this is the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for
the enrichment of society.”).

Fair use is not limited to transformative works. SeeCampbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. at 579 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 . But because the only purpose found by the district court and relied on by defendants is the creation
of a transformative work, in analyzing this factor, we necessarily focus on whether a finding of transformative
purpose could be made as a matter of law on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.

10 Even if such commentary is not essential to fair use, it remains the case, even after Cariou, that commentary or criticism
on another's work is “[a]mong the best recognized justifications for copying” because such commentary or criticism is in the
public interest and frequently requires quoting the copyrighted work to be effective. Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d
at 215 ; seeCampbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. at 580 -81, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (explaining that if new work “has no
critical bearing on the substance or style of the original composition ... the claim to fairness in borrowing from another's work
diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like the extent of its commerciality, loom larger”). Hand to
Godmay be a “critique of the social norms governing a small town in the Bible Belt,” TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 151
F.Supp.3d at 436, but defendants have not argued that it is a commentary or criticism of Who's on First?. Thus, such
transformative purposes do not justify defendants’ challenged use here.

“In Swatch Group Management Services Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P., 756 F.3d 73 (2d Cir. 2014) , we stated in dictumthat “a
secondary work can be transformative in function or purpose without altering or actually adding to the original work.” Id.at 84
(internal quotation marks omitted). But that statement must be read in context. We were there discussing the fair use of data,
not the creation of new artistic work as in Cariou. In the former context, we recognized that “the need to convey information
to the public accurately may in some instances make it desirable and consonant with copyright law for a defendant to
faithfully reproduce an original work without alteration.” Id. That is not this case. Defendants used a verbatim portion of Who's
on First?in Hand to God. The unaltered use of such creative material within another creative work has a weaker claim to fair
use protection. SeeCampbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; Cariou v. Prince, 714 F.3d at 706
; see alsoNimmer § 13.05[A][2][a], at 18-187 (recognizing that “scope of fair use is greater when informational type works,
as opposed to more creative products[,] are involved” because there is “greater license to use portions” of “work more of



--- Page 15 ---
diligence than of originality or inventiveness” (internal quotation marks omitted)). For such an appropriation to be deemed
“fair use,” the new creative work must either use the copyrighted work for a different purpose or imbue it with a different
character, so as to alter the expression, meaning, or message of the original.

12See3 Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series285 (1997) (defining “McGuffin” as “particular event, object, factor, etc.,
which ... acts as the impetus for the sequence of events depicted, although often proving tangential to the plot it develops”);
see alsoMerriam—Webster's Collegiate Dictionary744 (11th ed. 2003) (defining “MacGuffin” as “object, event, or character in
film or story that serves to set and keep the plot in motion despite usu[ally] lacking intrinsic importance”).

18 We note that even a correct finding of transformative use is not necessarily determinative of the first statutory factor, much
less of fair use. SeeAuthors Guild v. Google Inc., 804 F.3d at 218 ; Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L. Rev. at
1111 (recognizing that “existence of ... transformative objective does not ... guarantee success in claiming fair use” because
“transformative justification must overcome factors favoring the copyright owner”).

14This court has sometimes assigned little weight to the commercial nature of a secondary use even absent a transformative
purpose. See, e.g., Castle Rock Entm't. Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Grp., Inc., 150 F.3d 132 , 142 (2d Cir. 1998). But where, as here,
defendants justify their use solely by reference to a transformative purpose, commercialism cannot automatically be
discounted absent a finding of such purpose. SeeBlanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d at 254 (discounting commercial nature of
secondary use only because new work was substantially transformative).

15 Because both parties seemingly concede that the Routine was protected from entering the public domain through at least
Tropics's initial copyright term, we need not determine whether Tropics's publication automatically divested Abbott and
Costello of their common law copyright and injected it into the public domain. SeeRoy Export Co. Establishment of Vaduz
Liechtenstein v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 672 F.2d 1095 , 1101-02 (2d Cir. 1982).

16 Plaintiffs acknowledged as much in the district court when they argued that the agreements’ language “represented a
clear grant of rights to UPC in all previous acts and routines created by Abbott and Costello ... if used in any motion pictures
produced by UPC in which Abbott & Costello provided their services.” Pls.’ Mem. Opp. Mot. Dismiss at 7, TCA Television
Corp. v. McCollum, No. 15—-cv—4325 (GBD), ECF No. 61 (emphasis added).

12 Seesuprap. 173 (quoting relevant sentence in July Agreement in full).
18 Because the agreements cannot be construed to effect an assignment of the Routine's copyright to UPC, we need not

decide whether they further conveyed the Routine's renewal rights. SeeCorcovado Music Corp. v. Hollis Music, Inc., 981
F.2d 679 , 684 (2d Cir. 1993) (recognizing strong presumption against conveyance of renewal rights).

No. 88-2102.
Argued Jan. 9, 1990.
Decided April 24, 1990.

Syllabus

In 1945, author Cornell Woolrich agreed to assign the motion picture rights to several of his stories, including the one
at issue, to petitioners' predecessor in interest. He also agreed to renew the copyrights in the stories at the appropriate time
and to assign the same motion picture rights to the predecessor in interest for the 28-year renewal term provided by the
Copyright Act of 1909. The film version of the story in question was produced and distributed in 1954. Woolrich died in 1968
without a surviving spouse or child and before he could obtain the rights in the renewal term for petitioners as promised. In
1969, his executor renewed the copyright in the story and assigned the renewal rights to respondent Abend. Apparently in
reliance on_Rohauer v. Killiam Shows, Inc., 551 F.2d 484 (CA2)—which held that the owner of the copyright in a derivative
work may continue to use the existing derivative work according to the original grant from the author of the pre-existing work
even if the grant of rights in the pre-existing work lapsed—petitioners subsequently re-released and publicly exhibited the
film. Abend filed suit, alleging, among other things, that the re-release infringed his copyright in the story because petitioners’
right to use the story during the renewal term lapsed when Woolrich died. The District Court granted petitioners’ motions for
summary judgment based on Rohauer and the ""fair use"" defense. The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the reasoning of
Rohauer. Relying on_Miller Music Corp. v. Charles N. Daniels, Inc., 362 U.S. 373 , 80 S.Ct. 792 , 4 L.Ed.2d 804 —which held
that assignment of renewal rights by an author before the time for renewal arrives cannot defeat the right of the author's
statutory successor to the renewal rights if the author dies before the right to renewal accrues—the court concluded that
petitioners received from Woolrich only an expectancy in the renewal rights that never matured, and that his executor, as his
statutory successor, was entitled to renew the copyright and to assign it to Abend. The court also determined that petitioners’
use of Woolrich's story in their film was not fair use.

Held:

1. The distribution and publication of a derivative work during the copyright renewal term of a pre-existing work
incorporated into the-

Page 208

derivative work infringes the rights of the owner of the pre-existing work where the author of that work agreed to assign the
rights in the renewal term to the derivative work's owner but died before the commencement of the renewal period and the
statutory successor does not assign the right to use the pre-existing work to the owner of the derivative work. Pp. 216-236.

(a) The renewal provisions of the 1909 and 1976 Copyright Acts, their legislative history, and the case law interpreting
hem establish that they were intended both to give the author a second chance to obtain fair remuneration for his creative
efforts and to provide his family, or his executors absent surviving family, with a ""new estate"" if he died before the renewal
period arrived. Under Miller Music, although the author may assign all of his exclusive rights in the copyrighted work by
assigning the renewal copyright without limitation, the assignee holds nothing if the author dies before commencement of
he renewal period. This being the rule with respect to all of the renewal rights, it follows, a fortiori, that assignees such as
petitioners of the right to produce a derivative work or some other portion of the renewal rights also hold nothing but an
unfulfilled and unenforceable expectancy if the author dies before the renewal period, unless the assignees secure a
ransfer of the renewal rights from the author's statutory successor. Pp. 216-221.

(b) Petitioners’ contention that any right the owner of rights in the pre-existing work might have had to sue for
infringement that occurs during the renewal term is extinguished by creation of the new work is not supported by any
express provision of the Act nor by the rationale as to the scope of protection achieved in a derivative work, and is contrary
‘0 the axiomatic principle that a person may exploit only such copyrighted literary material as he either owns or is licensed to
use. Section 7 of the 1909 Act and § 103(b) of the 1976 Act made explicit the well-settled rule that the owner of a derivative
work receives copyright protection only for the material contributed by him and to the extent he has obtained a grant of rights
in the pre-existing work. Pp. 221-224.

(c) Nor is petitioners' position supported by the termination provisions of the 1976 Act, which, for works existing in
their original or renewal terms as of January 1, 1978, empowered the author to gain an additional 19 years' copyright


--- Page 2 ---
protection by terminating any grant of rights at the end of the renewal term, except, under 17 U.S.C. § 304(c)(6)(A) (1988
ed.), the right to use a derivative work for which the owner of the derivative work has held valid rights in the original and
renewal terms. No overarching policy preventing authors of pre-existing works from blocking distribution of derivative works
may be inferred from § 304(c)(6)(A), which was part of a compromise between competing special inter-

Page 209

ests. In fact, the plain language of the section indicates that Congress assumed that the owner of the pre-existing work
continued to possess the right to sue for infringement even after incorporation of that work into the derivative work, since,
otherwise, Congress would not have explicitly withdrawn the right to terminate use rights in the limited circumstances
contemplated by the section. Pp. 224-227.

(d) Thus, the Rohauer theory is supported by neither the 1909 nor the 1976 Act. Even if it were, however, the ""rule"" of
that case would make little sense when applied across the derivative works spectrum. For example, although the
contribution by the derivative author of a condensed book might be little as compared to that of the original author,

publication of the book would not infringe the pre-existing work under the Rohauer""rule"" even though the derivative author
has no license or grant of rights in the pre-existing work. In fact, the Rohauer""rule"" is considered to be an interest-balancing
approach. Pp. 227-228.

(e) Petitioners’ contention that the rule applied here will undermine the Copyright Act's policy of ensuring the
dissemination of creative works is better addressed by Congress than the courts. In attempting to fulfill its constitutional
mandate to ""secur[e] for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to their Respective Writings,"" Congress has
created a balance between the artist's right to control the work during the term of the copyright protection and the public's
need for access to creative works. Absent an explicit statement of congressional intent that the rights in the renewal term of
an owner of a pre-existing work are extinguished when his work is incorporated into another work, it is not the role of this
Court to alter the delicate balance Congress has labored to achieve. Pp. 228-230.

(f) Section 6 of the 1909 Act, 17 U.S.C. § 7 (1976 ed.)—which provides that derivate works when produced with the
consent of the copyright proprietor of the pre-existing work ""shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright . . .; but the
publication of any such new works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed
...,"" or be construed to affect the copyright status of the original work—does not, as the dissent contends, give the original
author the power to sell the rights to make a derivative work that upon creation and copyright would be completely
independent of the original work. This assertion is derived from three erroneous premises. First, since the plain meaning of
the ""force or validity"" clause is that the copyright in the ""matter employed""— i.e., the pre-existing work when it is incorporated
into the derivative work is not abrogated by publication of the derivative work, the dissent misreads § 7 when it asserts that
only the copyright in the ""original work"" survives the author's conveyance of derivative rights. Second, the substitution of
""publication"" for ""copy right""

Page 210

in the final version of the force or validity clause does not, as the dissent contends, establish that it was the publication of
the derivative work, and not the copyright, that was not to ""affect... any subsisting copyright."" Since publication of a work
without proper notice sent it into the public domain under the 1909 Act, the language change was necessary to ensure that
the publication of a derivative work without proper notice, including smaller portions that had not been previously published
and separately copyrighted, would not result in those sections moving into the public domain. Third, the dissent errs in
interpreting § 3 of the 1909 Act—which provides that a copyright protects all copyrightable component parts of a work and
""all matter therein in which copyright is already subsisting, but without extending the duration or scope of such copyright""—
as indicating, when read with § 7, that the copyright on derivative work extends to both the new material and that ""in which
the copyright is already subsisting,"" such that the derivative work proprietor has the right to publish and distribute the entire
work absent permission from the owner of the pre-existing work. When § 7 states that derivative works ""shall be regarded as
new works subject to copyright,"" it simply confirms that § 3's provision that one can obtain copyright in a work, parts of which
were already copyrighted, extends to derivative works. More important, § 7's second clause merely clarifies what might have
been otherwise unclear—that the § 3 principle of preservation of the duration or scope of the subsisting copyright applies to
derivative works, and that neither the scope of the copyright in the matter employed nor the duration of the copyright in the
derivative work is undermined by publication of the derivative work. Pp. 230-236.

2. Petitioners’ unauthorized use of Woolrich's story in their film does not constitute a noninfringing ""fair use."" The film
does not fall into any of the categories of fair use enumerated in 17 U.S.C. § 107 (1988 ed.); e.g., criticism, comment, news
reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Nor does it meet any of the nonexclusive criteria that § 107 requires a court to
consider. First, since petitioners received $12 million from the film's re-release during the renewal term, their use was
commercial rather than educational. Second, the nature of the copyrighted work is fictional and creative rather than factual.
Third, the story was a substantial portion of the film, which expressly used its unique setting, characters, plot, and sequence
of events. Fourth, and most important, the record supports the conclusion that re-release of the film impinged on Abend's
ability to market new versions of the story. Pp. 236-238.

863 F.2d 1465 (CA9 1988), affirmed and remanded.

Justice O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.

The author of a pre-existing work may assign to another the right to use it in a derivative work. In this case the author
of a pre-existing work agreed to assign the rights in his renewal copyright term to the owner of a derivative work, but died
before the commencement of the renewal period. The question presented is whether the owner of the derivative work
infringed the rights of the successor owner of the pre-existing work by continued distribution and publication of the derivative
work during the renewal term of the pre-existing work.

Cornell Woolrich authored the story ""It Had to Be Murder,"" which was first published in February 1942 in Dime
Detective Magazine. The magazine's publisher, Popular Publications, Inc., obtained the rights to magazine publication of
the story and Woolrich retained all other rights. Popular Publications obtained a blanket copyright for the issue of Dime
Detective Magazine in which ""It Had to Be Murder"" was published.

Page 212

The Copyright Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 1075, 17 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (1976 ed.) (1909 Act), provided authors a 28-year
initial term of copyright protection plus a 28-year renewal term. See 17 U.S.C. § 24 (1976 ed.). In 1945, Woolrich agreed to
assign the rights to make motion picture versions of six of his stories, including ""It Had to Be Murder,"" to B.G. De Sylva
Productions for $9,250. He also agreed to renew the copyrights in the stories at the appropriate time and to assign the same
motion picture rights to De Sylva Productions for the 28-year renewal term. In 1953, actor Jimmy Stewart and director Alfred
Hitchcock formed a production company, Patron, Inc., which obtained the motion picture rights in ""It Had to Be Murder"" from
De Sylva's successors in interest for $10,000.

In 1954, Patron, Inc., along with Paramount Pictures, produced and distributed ""Rear Window,"" the motion picture
version of Woolrich's story ""It Had to Be Murder."" Woolrich died in 1968 before he could obtain the rights in the renewal term
for petitioners as promised and without a surviving spouse or child. He left his property to a trust administered by his
executor, Chase Manhattan Bank, for the benefit of Columbia University. On December 29, 1969, Chase Manhattan Bank
renewed the copyright in the ""It Had to Be Murder"" story pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 24 (1976 ed.). Chase Manhattan assigned
the renewal rights to respondent Abend for $650 plus 10% of all proceeds from exploitation of the story.

""Rear Window"" was broadcast on the ABC television network in 1971. Respondent then notified petitioners Hitchcock
(now represented by cotrustees of his will), Stewart, and MCA Inc., the owners of the ""Rear Window"" motion picture and
renewal rights in the motion picture, that he owned the renewal rights in the copyright and that their distribution of the motion
picture without his permission infringed his copyright in the story. Hitchcock, Stewart, and MCA nonetheless entered into a
second license with ABC to-

Page 213

rebroad cast the motion picture. In 1974, respondent filed suit against these same petitioners, and others, in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging copyright infringement. Respondent dismissed his
complaint in return for $25,000.

Three years later, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided_Rohauer v. Killiam Shows, Inc.,
551 F.2d 484 , cert. denied, 431 U.S. 949 , 97 S.Ct. 2666 , 53 L.Ed.2d 266 (1977) , in which it held that the owner of the
copyright in a derivative work ' may continue to use the existing derivative work according to the original grant from the
author of the pre-existing work even if the grant of rights in the pre-existing work lapsed. 551 F.2d, at 494. Several years
later, apparently in reliance on Rohauer, petitioners re-released the motion picture in a variety of media, including new 35
and 16 millimeter prints for theatrical exhibition in the United States, videocassettes, and videodiscs. They also publicly
exhibited the motion picture in theaters, over cable television, and through videodisc and videocassette rentals and sales.

Respondent then brought the instant suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California
against Hitchcock, Stewart, MCA, and Universal Film Exchanges, a subsidiary of MCA and the distributor of the motion
picture. Respondent's complaint alleges that the re-release of the motion picture infringes his copyright in the story because
petitioners’ right to use the story during the renewal term lapsed when Woolrich died before he could register for the renewal
term and transfer his renewal rights to them. Respondent also contends that petitioners have interfered with his rights in the
renewal term of the story in other ways. He alleges that he sought to contract with Home Box

Page 214

Office (HBO) to produce a play and television version of the story, but that petitioners wrote to him and HBO stating that


--- Page 4 ---
neither he nor HBO could use either the title, ""Rear Window"" or ""It Had to Be Murder."" Respondent also alleges that
petitioners further interfered with the renewal copyright in the story by attempting to sell the right to make a television sequel
and that the re-release of the original motion picture itself interfered with his ability to produce other derivative works.

Petitioners filed motions for summary judgment, one based on the decision in Rohauer, supra, and the other based on
alleged defects in the story's copyright. Respondent moved for summary judgment on the ground that petitioners’ use of the
motion picture constituted copyright infringement. Petitioners responded with a third motion for summary judgment based on
a ""fair use"" defense. The District Court granted petitioners' motions for summary judgment based on Rohauer and the fair
use defense and denied respondent's motion for summary judgment, as well as petitioners’ motion for summary judgment
alleging defects in the story's copyright. Respondent appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
and petitioners cross-appealed.

The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's copyright in the renewal term of the story was not defective,
Abend v. MCA, Inc., 863 F.2d 1465 , 1472 (1988). The issue before the court, therefore, was whether petitioners were
entitled to distribute and exhibit the motion picture without respondent's permission despite respondent's valid copyright in
the pre-existing story. Relying on the renewal provision of the 1909 Act, 17 U.S.C. § 24 (1976 ed.), respondent argued
before the Court of Appeals that because he obtained from Chase Manhattan Bank, the statutory successor, the renewal
right free and clear of any purported assignments of any interest in the renewal copyright, petitioners’ distribution and
publication of ""Rear Window"" without authorization infringed his renewal copyright. Petitioners responded that

Page 215

they had the right to continue to exploit ""Rear Window"" during the 28-year renewal period because Woolrich had agreed to
assign to petitioners’ predecessor in interest the motion picture rights in the story for the renewal period.

Petitioners also relied, as did the District Court, on the decision in Rohauer v. Killiam Shows, Inc., supra. In Rohauer,
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that statutory successors to the renewal copyright in a pre-existing work
under § 24 could not ""depriv[e] the proprietor of the derivative copyright of a right . . . to use so much of the underlying
copyrighted work as already has been embodied in the copyrighted derivative work, as a matter of copyright law."" /d., at 492.
The Court of Appeals in the instant case rejected this reasoning, concluding that even if the pre-existing work had been
incorporated into a derivative work, use of the pre-existing work was infringing unless the owner of the derivative work held a
valid grant of rights in the renewal term.

The court relied on_Miller Music Corp. v. Charles N. Daniels, Inc., 362 U.S. 373 , 80 S.Ct. 792 , 4 L.Ed.2d 804 (1960) ,
in which we held that assignment of renewal rights by an author before the time for renewal arrives cannot defeat the right of
the author's statutory successor to the renewal rights if the author dies before the right to renewal accrues. An assignee of
the renewal rights takes only an expectancy: ""Until [the time for registration of renewal rights] arrives, assignees of renewal
rights take the risk that the rights acquired may never vest in their assignors. A purchaser of such an interest is deprived of
nothing. Like all purchasers of contingent interests, he takes subject to the possibility that the contingency may not occur.""
Id., at 378, 80 S.Ct., at 796 . The Court of Appeals reasoned that ""[i]f Miller Music makes assignment of the full renewal
rights in the underlying copyright unenforceable when the author dies before effecting renewal of the copyright, then, a
fortiori, an assignment of part of the rights in the underlying work, the right to produce a movie version, must

Page 216

also be unenforceable if the author dies before effecting renewal of the underlying copyright."" 863 F.2d, at 1476. Finding
further support in the legislative history of the 1909 Act and rejecting the Rohauer court's reliance on the equities and the
termination provisions of the 1976 Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 203(b)(1), 304(c)(6)(A) the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioners
received from Woolrich only an expectancy in the renewal rights that never matured; upon Woolrich's death, Woolrich's
statutory successor, Chase Manhattan Bank, became ""entitled to a renewal and extension of the copyright,"" which Chase
Manhattan secured ""within one year prior to the expiration of the original term of copyright."" 17 U.S.C. § 24 (1976 ed.).
Chase Manhattan then assigned the existing rights in the copyright to respondent.

The Court of Appeals also addressed at length the proper remedy, an issue not relevant to the issue on which we
granted certiorari. We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict between the decision in Rohauer, supra, and the decision
below. 493 U.S. 807 , 110 S.Ct. 47 , 107 L.Ed.2d 16 (1989) . Petitioners do not challenge the Court of Appeals’
determination that respondent's copyright in the renewal term is valid, and we express no opinion regarding the Court of
Appeals' decision on this point.

ll
A.

Petitioners would have us read into the Copyright Act a limitation on the statutorily created rights of the owner of an
underlying work. They argue in essence that the rights of the owner of the copyright in the derivative use of the pre-existing
work are extinguished once it is incorporated into the derivative work, assuming the author of the pre-existing work has
agreed to assign his renewal rights. Because we find no support for such a curtailment of rights in either the 1909 Act or the
1976 Act, or in the legislative history of either, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.


--- Page 5 ---
Page 217

Petitioners and amicus Register of Copyrights assert, as the Court of Appeals assumed, that § 23 of the 1909 Act,
and the case law interpreting that provision, directly control the disposition of this case. Respondent counters that the
provisions of the 1976 Act control, but that the 1976 Act reenacted § 24 in § 304 and, therefore, the language and judicial
interpretation of § 24 are relevant to our consideration of this case. Under either theory, we must look to the language of and
case law interpreting § 24.

The right of renewal found in § 24 provides authors a second opportunity to obtain remuneration for their works.
Section 24 provides:

""[T]he author of [a copyrighted] work, if still living, or the widow, widower, or children of the author, if the author be not
living, or if such author, widow, widower, or children be not living, then the author's executors, or in the absence of a will, his
next of kin shall be entitled to a renewal and extension of the copyright in such work for a further term of twenty-eight years
when application for such renewal and extension shall have been made to the copyright office and duly registered therein
within one year prior to the expiration of the original term of copyright."" 17 U.S.C. § 24 (1976 ed.)

Since the earliest copyright statute in this country, the copyright term of ownership has been split between an original
term and a renewal term. Originally, the renewal was intended merely to serve as an extension of the original term; at the
end of the original term, the renewal could be effected and claimed by the author, if living, or by the author's executors,
administrators, or assigns. See Copyright Act of May 31, 1790, ch. XV, § 1, 1 Stat. 124. In 1831, Congress altered the
provision so that the author could assign his contingent interest in the renewal term, but could not, through his assignment,
divest the rights of his widow or children in the renewal term. See Copyright Act of February 3, 1831, ch. XVI, 4 Stat. 436;
see also G. Curtis, Law of Copyright 235

Page 218

(1847). The 1831 renewal provisions created ""an entirely new policy, completely dissevering the title, breaking up the
continuance . . . and vesting an absolutely new title eo nomine in the persons designated."" White-Smith Music Publishing
Co. v. Goff, 187 F. 247, 250 (CA1 1911). In this way, Congress attempted to give the author a second chance to control and
benefit from his work. Congress also intended to secure to the author's family the opportunity to exploit the work if the author
died before he could register for the renewal term. See Bricker, Renewal and Extension of Copyright, 29 S.Cal.L.Rev. 23, 27
(1955) (""The renewal term of copyright is the law's second chance to the author and his family to profit from his mental
labors""). ""The evident purpose of [the renewal provision] is to provide for the family of the author after his death. Since the
author cannot assign his family's renewal rights, [it] takes the form of a compulsory bequest of the copyright to the
designated persons."" De Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U.S. 570 , 582, 76 S.Ct. 974 , 981, 100 L.Ed. 1415 (1956) . See Fred
Fisher Music Co. v. M. Witmark & Sons, 318 U.S. 643 , 651,63 S.Ct. 773 , 776, 87 L.Ed. 1055 (1943) (if at the end of the
original copyright period, the author is not living, ""his family stand[s] in more need of the only means of subsistence
ordinarily left to them"" (citation omitted)).

In its debates leading up to the Copyright Act of 1909, Congress elaborated upon the policy underlying a system
comprised of an original term and a completely separate renewal term. See G. Ricordi & Co. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.
189 F.2d 469 , 471 (CA2) (the renewal right ""creates a new estate, and the . . . cases which have dealt with the subject
assert that the new estate is clear of all rights, interests or licenses granted under the original copyright""), cert. denied, 342
U.S. 849 , 72 S.Ct. 77 , 96 L.Ed. 641 (1951) . ""It not infrequently happens that the author sells his copyright outright to a
publisher for a comparatively small sum."" H.R.Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 14 (1909). The renewal term permits
the author, originally in a poor bargaining position, to renegoti-

Page 219

ate the terms of the grant once the value of the work has been tested. ""[U]nlike real property and other forms of personal
property, [a copyright] is by its very nature incapable of accurate monetary evaluation prior to its exploitation."" 2 M. Nimmer
& D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 9.02, p. 9-23 (1989) (hereinafter Nimmer). ""If the work proves to be a great success
and lives beyond the term of twenty-eight years, . . . it should be the exclusive right of the author to take the renewal term,
and the law should be framed . . . so that [the author] could not be deprived of that right."" H.R.Rep. No. 2222, supra, at 14.
With these purposes in mind, Congress enacted the renewal provision of the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U.S.C. § 24 (1976
ed.). With respect to works in their original or renewal term as of January 1, 1978, Congress retained the two-term system of
copyright protection in the 1976 Act. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 304(a) and (b) (1988 ed.) (incorporating language of 17 U.S.C. § 24
(1976 ed.)).

Applying these principles in Miller Music Corp. v. Charles N. Daniels, Inc., 362 U.S. 373 , 80 S.Ct. 792 , 4 L.Ed.2d 804
(1960) , this Court held that when an author dies before the renewal period arrives, his executor is entitled to the renewal
rights, even though the author previously assigned his renewal rights to another party. ""An assignment by an author of his
renewal rights made before the original copyright expires is valid against the world, if the author is alive at the
commencement of the renewal period. [Fred] Fisher Co. v. [M.] Witmark & Sons, 318 U.S. 643 [63 S.Ct. 773], so holds."" /d.,
362 U.S., at 375 , 80 S.Ct., at 794 . If the author dies before that time, the ""next of kin obtain the renewal copyright free of
any claim founded upon an assignment made by the author in his lifetime. These results follow not because the author's
assignment is invalid but because he had only an expectancy to assign; and his death, prior to the renewal period,



--- Page 6 ---
terminates his interest in the renewal which by § 24 vests in the named classes."" /bid. The legislative history of the 1909 Act
echoes this view: ""The right of renewal is contingent. It does not vest until the end [of the original term].

Page 220

If [the author] is alive at the time of renewal, then the original contract may pass it, but his widow or children or other
persons entitled would not be bound by that contract."" 5 Legislative History of the 1909 Copyright Act, Part K, p. 77 (E.
Brylawski & A. Goldman eds. 1976) (statement of Mr. Hale). 2 Thus, the renewal provisions were intended to give the author
a second chance to obtain fair remuneration for his creative efforts and to provide the author's family a ""new estate"" if the
author died before the renewal period arrived.

An author holds a bundle of exclusive rights in the copyrighted work, among them the right to copy and the right to
incorporate the work into derivative works. ° By assigning the renewal copyright in the work without limitation, as in Miller
Music, the author assigns all of these rights. After Miller Music, if the author dies before the commencement of the renewal
period, the assignee holds nothing. If the assignee of all of the renewal rights holds nothing upon the death of the assignor
before arrival of the renewal period,

Page 221

then, a fortiori, the assignee of a portion of the renewal rights, e.g., the right to produce a derivative work, must also hold
nothing. See also Brief for Register of Copyrights as Amicus Curiae 22 ("" [AJny assignment of renewal rights made during the
original term is void if the author dies before the renewal period""). Therefore, if the author dies before the renewal period,
then the assignee may continue to use the original work only if the author's successor transfers the renewal rights to the
assignee. This is the rule adopted by the Court of Appeals below and advocated by the Register of Copyrights. See 863
F.2d, at 1478; Brief for Register of Copyrights as Amicus Curiae 22. Application of this rule to this case should end the
inquiry. Woolrich died before the commencement of the renewal period in the story, and, therefore, petitioners hold only an
unfulfilled expectancy. Petitioners have been ""deprived of nothing. Like all purchasers of contingent interests, [they took]
subject to the possibility that the contingency may not occur."" Miller Music, supra,362 U.S., at 378 , 80 S.Ct., at 796 .

B

The reason that our inquiry does not end here, and that we granted certiorari, is that the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit reached a contrary result in Rohauer v. Killiam Shows, Inc., 551 F.2d 484 (1977) . Petitioners' theory is
drawn largely from Rohauer. The Court of Appeals in Rohauer attempted to craft a ""proper reconciliation"" between the
owner of the pre-existing work, who held the right to the work pursuant to Miller Music, and the owner of the derivative work,
who had a great deal to lose if the work could not be published or distributed. 551 F.2d, at 490. Addressing a case factually
similar to this case, the court concluded that even if the death of the author caused the renewal rights in the pre-existing
work to revert to the statutory successor, the owner of the derivative work could continue to exploit that work. The court
reasoned that the 1976 Act and the relevant precedents did not preclude such a re-

Page 222
sult and that it was necessitated by a balancing of the equities:

""[T]he equities lie preponderantly in favor of the proprietor of the derivative copyright. In contrast to the situation where
an assignee or licensee has done nothing more than print, publicize and distribute a copyrighted story or novel, a person
who with the consent of the author has created an opera or a motion picture film will often have made contributions literary,
musical and economic, as great as or greater than the original author. . . . [T]he purchaser of derivative rights has no truly
effective way to protect himself against the eventuality of the author's death before the renewal period since there is no way

of telling who will be the surviving widow, children or next of kin or the executor until that date arrives."" /d., at 493.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit thereby shifted the focus from the right to use the pre-existing work in a
derivative work to a right inhering in the created derivative work itself. By rendering the renewal right to use the original work
irrelevant, the court created an exception to our ruling in Miller Music and, as petitioners concede, created an ""intrusion"" on
the statutorily created rights of the owner of the pre-existing work in the renewal term. Brief for Petitioners 33.

Though petitioners do not, indeed could not, argue that its language expressly supports the theory they draw from
Rohauer, they implicitly rely on § 6 of the 1909 Act, 17 U.S.C. § 7 (1976 ed.), which states that ""dramatizations . . . of
copyrighted works when produced with the consent of the proprietor of the copyright in such works . . . shall be regarded as
new works subject to copyright under the provisions of this title."" Petitioners maintain that the creation of the ""new,"" i.e.,
derivative, work extinguishes any right the owner of rights in the pre-existing work might have had to sue for infringement
that occurs during the renewal term.

Page 223

We think, as stated in Nimmer, that ""[t]his conclusion is neither warranted by any express provision of the Copyright
Act, nor by the rationale as to the scope of protection achieved in a derivative work. It is moreover contrary to the axiomatic
copyright principle that a person may exploit only such copyrighted literary material as he either owns or is licensed to use.""


--- Page 7 ---
1 Nimmer § 3.07[A], pp. 3-23 to 3-24 (footnotes omitted). The aspects of a derivative work added by the derivative author
are that author's property, but the element drawn from the pre-existing work remains on grant from the owner of the pre-
existing work. See Russell v. Price, 612 F.2d 1123 , 1128 (CA9 1979) (reaffirming ""well-established doctrine that a derivative
copyright protects only the new material contained in the derivative work, not the matter derived from the underlying work""),
cert. denied, 446 U.S. 952 , 100 S.Ct. 2919 , 64 L.Ed.2d 809 (1980) ; see also Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539 , 547, 105 S.Ct. 2218 2223, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (""The copyright is limited to those aspects of
the work termed 'expression'—that display the stamp of the author's originality""). So long as the pre-existing work remains
out of the public domain, its use is infringing if one who employs the work does not have a valid license or assignment for
use of the pre-existing work. Russell v. Price, supra, at 1128 (""[E]stablished doctrine prevents unauthorized copying or other
infringing use of the underlying work or any part of that work contained in the derivative product so long as the underlying
work itself remains copyrighted""). It is irrelevant whether the pre-existing work is inseparably intertwined with the derivative
work. See Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Cos., 538 F.2d 14 , 20 (CA2 1976) (""[C]opyright in the underlying script survives
intact despite the incorporation of that work into a derivative work""). Indeed, the plain language of § 7 supports the view that
the full force of the copyright in the pre-existing work is preserved despite incorporation into the derivative work. See 17
U.S.C. § 7 (1976 ed.) (publication of the derivative work ""shall not affect the force or validity of

Page 224

any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed""); see also 17 U.S.C. § 3 (1976 ed.) (copyright protection of a work
extends to ""all matter therein in which copyright is already subsisting, but without extending the duration or scope of such
copyright""). This well-settled rule also was made explicit in the 1976 Act:

""The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the material contributed by the author of such work,
as distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right in the
preexisting material. The copyright in such work is independent of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration,
ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in the pre-existing material."" 17 U.S.C. § 103\(b).

See also B. Ringer, Renewal of Copyright (1960), reprinted as Copyright Law Revision Study No. 31, prepared for the
Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Cong., 2d. Sess., 169-170 (1961) (""[O]n the basis of judicial authority, legislative
history, and the opinions of the commentators, . .. someone cannot avoid his obligations to the owner of a renewal copyright
merely because he created and copyrighted a 'new version' under a license or assignment which terminated at the end of
the first term"") (footnotes omitted).

Properly conceding there is no explicit support for their theory in the 1909 Act, its legislative history, or the case law,
petitioners contend, as did the court in Rohauer, that the termination provisions of the 1976 Act, while not controlling,
support their theory of the case. For works existing in their original or renewal terms as of January 1, 1978, the 1976 Act
added 19 years to the 1909 Act's provision of 28 years of initial copyright protection and 28 years of renewal protection. See
17 U.S.C. §§ 304(a) and (b). For those works, the author has the power to terminate the grant of rights at the end of the
renewal term and, therefore, to gain the benefit of that additional 19 years of protection. See

Page 225

§ 304(c). In effect, the 1976 Act provides a third opportunity for the author to benefit from a work in its original or renewal
term as of January 1, 1978. Congress, however, created one exception to the author's right to terminate: The author may
not, at the end of the renewal term, terminate the right to use a derivative work for which the owner of the derivative work
has held valid rights in the original and renewal terms. See § 304(c)(6)(A). The author, however, may terminate the right to
create new derivative works. /bid. For example, if petitioners held a valid copyright in the story throughout the original and
renewal terms, and the renewal term in ""Rear Window"" were about to expire, petitioners could continue to distribute the
motion picture even if respondent terminated the grant of rights, but could not create a new motion picture version of the
story. Both the court in Rohauer and petitioners infer from this exception to the right to terminate an intent by Congress to
prevent authors of pre-existing works from blocking distribution of derivative works. In other words, because Congress
decided not to permit authors to exercise a third opportunity to benefit from a work incorporated into a derivative work, the
Act expresses a general policy of undermining the author's second opportunity. We disagree.

The process of compromise between competing special interests leading to the enactment of the 1976 Act
undermines any such attempt to draw an overarching policy out of § 304(c)(6)(A), which only prevents termination with
respect to works in their original or renewal copyright terms as of January 1, 1978, and only at the end of the renewal period.
See Ringer, First Thoughts on the Copyright Act of 1976, 13 Copyright 187, 188-189 (1977) (each provision of 1976 Act was
drafted through series of compromises between interested parties). More specifically, § 304(c)

""was part of a compromise package involving the controversial and intertwined issues of initial ownership, duration of
copyright, and reversion of rights. The Regis-

Page 226

ter, convinced that the opposition . . . would scuttle the proposed legislation, drafted a number of alternative proposals.

""Finally, the Copyright Office succeeded in urging negotiations among representatives of authors, composers,


--- Page 8 ---
book and music publishers, and motion picture studios that produced a compromise on the substance and language of
several provisions.

""Because the controversy surrounding the provisions disappeared once the parties reached a compromise, however,
Congress gave the provisions little or no detailed consideration. . .. Thus, there is no evidence whatsoever of what members
of Congress believed the language to mean."" Litman, Copyright, Compromise, and Legislative History, 72 Cornell L. Rev.
857, 865-868 (1987) (footnotes omitted).

In fact, if the 1976 Act's termination provisions provide any guidance at all in this case, they tilt against petitioners’
theory. The plain language of the termination provision itself indicates that Congress assumed that the owner of the pre-
existing work possessed the right to sue for infringement even after incorporation of the pre-existing work in the derivative
work.

""A derivative work prepared under authority of the grant before its termination may continue to be utilized under the
terms of the grant after its termination, but this privilege does not extend to the preparation after the termination of other
derivative works based upon the copyrighted work covered by the terminated grant."" § 304(c)(6)(A) (emphasis added).

Congress would not have stated explicitly in § 304(c)(6)(A) that, at the end of the renewal term, the owner of the
rights in the pre-existing work may not terminate use rights in existing derivative works unless Congress had assumed that

Page 227

the owner continued to hold the right to sue for infringement even after incorporation of the pre-existing work into the

derivative work. Cf. Mills Music, Inc. v. Snyder, 469 U.S. 153 , 164, 105 S.Ct. 638 , 645, 83 L.Ed.2d 556 (1985) (§ 304(c)(6)
(A) ""carves out an exception from the reversion of rights that takes place when an author exercises his right to termination"").

Accordingly, we conclude that neither the 1909 Act nor the 1976 Act provides support for the theory set forth in
Rohauer. And even if the theory found some support in the statute or the legislative history, the approach set forth in
Rohauer is problematic. Petitioners characterize the result in Rohauer as a bright-line ""rule."" The Court of Appeals in
Rohauer, however, expressly implemented policy considerations as a means of reconciling what it viewed as the competing
interests in that case. See 551 F.2d, at 493-494. While the result in Rohauer might make some sense in some contexts, it
makes no sense in others. In the case of a condensed book, for example, the contribution by the derivative author may be
little, while the contribution by the original author is great. Yet, under the Rohauer ""rule,"" publication of the condensed book
would not infringe the pre-existing work even though the derivative author has no license or valid grant of rights in the pre-
existing work. See Brief for Committee for Literary Property Studies as Amicus Curiae 29-31; see also Brief for Songwriters
Guild of America as Amicus Curiae 11-12 (policy reasons set forth in Rohauer make little sense when applied to musical
compositions). Thus, even if the Rohauer""rule"" made sense in terms of policy in that case, it makes little sense when it is
applied across the derivative works spectrum. Indeed, in the view of the commentators, Rohauer did not announce a ""rule,""
but rather an ""interest-balancing approach."" See Jaszi, When Works Collide: Derivative Motion Pictures, Underlying Rights,
and the Public Interest, 28 UCLA L.Rev. 715, 758-761 (1981); Note, Derivative Copyright and the 1909

Page 228
Act—New Clarity or Confusion?, 44 Brooklyn L.Rev. 905, 926-927 (1978).

Finally, petitioners urge us to consider the policies underlying the Copyright Act. They argue that the rule announced
by the Court of Appeals will undermine one of the policies of the Act—the dissemination of creative works—by leading to
many fewer works reaching the public. Amicus Columbia Pictures asserts that ""[s]ome owners of underlying work renewal
copyrights may refuse to negotiate, preferring instead to retire their copyrighted works, and all derivative works based
hereon, from public use. Others may make demands—like respondent's demand for 50% of petitioners’ future gross
proceeds in excess of advertising expenses . . . which are so exorbitant that a negotiated economic accommodation will be
impossible."" Brief for Columbia Pictures et al. as Amici Curiae 21. These arguments are better addressed by Congress than
he courts.

In any event, the complaint that respondent's monetary request in this case is so high as to preclude agreement fails
‘0 acknowledge that an initially high asking price does not preclude bargaining. Presumably, respondent is asking for a
share in the proceeds because he wants to profit from the distribution of the work, not because he seeks suppression of it.

Moreover, although dissemination of creative works is a goal of the Copyright Act, the Act creates a balance between
he artist's right to control the work during the term of the copyright protection and the public's need for access to creative
works. The copyright term is limited so that the public will not be permanently deprived of the fruits of an artist's labors. See
Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 429, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 782, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (the
limited monopoly conferred by the Copyright Act ""is intended to motivate creative activity of authors and inventors by the
provision of a special reward, and to allow the public access to the products of their genius after the limited period of
exclusive control has expired""). But nothing in the copyright statutes would



--- Page 9 ---
Page 229

prevent an author from hoarding all of his works during the term of the copyright. In fact, this Court has held that a copyright
owner has the capacity arbitrarily to refuse to license one who seeks to exploit the work. See Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286
U.S. 123 , 127,52 S.Ct. 546 , 547,76 L.Ed. 1010 (1932) .

The limited monopoly granted to the artist is intended to provide the necessary bargaining capital to garner a fair price
for the value of the works passing into public use. See Harper & Row. Publishers. Inc. v. Nation Enterprises. 471 U.S., at
546 , 105 S.Ct., at 2223 (""The rights conferred by copyright are designed to assure contributors to the store of knowledge a
fair return for their labors""); Register of Copyrights, Copyright Law Revision, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (Comm.Print 1961)
(""While some limitations and conditions on copyright are essential in the public interest, they should not be so burdensome
and strict as to deprive authors of their just reward. . . . [T]heir rights should be broad enough to give them a fair share of the
revenue to be derived from the market for their works""). When an author produces a work which later commands a higher
price in the market than the original bargain provided, the copyright statute is designed to provide the author the power to
negotiate for the realized value of the work. That is how the separate renewal term was intended to operate. See Ringer,
Renewal of Copyright (1960), reprinted as Copyright Law Revision Study No. 31, prepared for the Senate Committee on the
Judiciary, 86th Cong., 2d. Sess., 125 (1961) (""Congress wanted to give [the author] an opportunity to benefit from the
success of his work and to renegotiate disadvantageous bargains . . . made at a time when the value of the work [wa]s
unknown or conjectural and the author . . . necessarily in a poor bargaining position""). At heart, petitioners’ true complaint is
that they will have to pay more for the use of works they have employed in creating their own works. But such a result was
contemplated by Congress and is consistent with the goals of the Copyright Act.

Page 230

With the Copyright Act of 1790, Congress provided an initial term of protection plus a renewal term that did not survive the
author. In the Copyright Act of 1831, Congress devised a completely separate renewal term that survived the death of the
author so as to create a ""new estate"" and to benefit the author's family, and, with the passage of the 1909 Act, his

executors. See supra, at 217-219. The 1976 Copyright Act provides a single, fixed term, but provides an inalienable
termination right. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 203, 302. This evolution of the duration of copyright protection tellingly illustrates the
difficulties Congress faces in attempting to ""secur[e] for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to their respective
Writings."" U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Absent an explicit statement of congressional intent that the rights in the renewal term
of an owner of a pre-existing work are extinguished upon incorporation of his work into another work, it is not our role to alter
the delicate balance Congress has labored to achieve.

Cc

In a creative, though ultimately indefensible, exposition of the 1909 Act, the dissent attempts to breathe life into
petitioners’ suggestion that the derivative work is somehow independent of the pre-existing work. Although no Court of
Appeals in the 81 years since enactment of the 1909 Act has held as much, and although the petitioners have not argued
the point, the dissent contends that ""§ 7 was intended to . . . give the original author the power to sell the right to make a
derivative work that upon creation and copyright would be completely independent of the original work."" Post, at 244; see
also post, at 248. This assertion, far removed from the more modest holding of Rohauer, is derived from three erroneous
premises.

First, we think the dissent misreads § 7, which provides:
""Compilations or abridgments, adaptations, arrangements, dramatizations, translations, or other versions of
Page 231

works in the public domain or of copyrighted works when produced with the consent of the proprietor of the copyright
in such works, or works republished with new matter, shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright under the
provisions of this title; but the publication of any such new works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting
copyright upon the matter employed or any part thereof, or be construed to imply an exclusive right to such use of the
original works, or to secure or extend copyright in such original works."" 17 U.S.C. § 7 (1976 ed.).

The provision consists of one sentence with two clauses divided by a semicolon. The first clause lists the types of
works that may be derivative works, explains that one may incorporate either copyrighted or public domain works into a
derivative work, and further explains that the derivative work itself is copyrightable. The clause also expressly limits
incorporation of copyrighted works to instances where the owner of the pre-existing work ""consents.""

The second clause explains what publication of the new work does not portend: Publication of the derivative work
does not"" affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed’ (emphasis added); publication
of the derivative work does not mean that use of the original work in other works is precluded; and publication does not
mean that a copyright in the original work shall be secured, e.g., if the work was in the public domain, or extended, as where
the original work was copyrighted before the date that the derivative work is copyrighted. The plain meaning of the italicized
sentence is that the copyright in the ""matter employed""—the pre-existing work when it is incorporated into the derivative
work—is not abrogated by publication of the new work. The succeeding phrases preserve the copyright status of the original
work: Publication does not operate to prohibit other uses of the original work or to


--- Page 10 ---
Page 232

""secure or extend copyright in such original works."" Cf. post, at 249.

The dissent fails to heed § 7's preservation of copyright in both the ""matter employed"" and the ""original work."" Under
its theory, only the latter is preserved. See post, at 253 (""author's right to sell his derivative rights is exercised when consent
is conveyed and completed when the derivative work is copyrighted""); post, at 250 (underlying work ""owner . . . retains full
dominion and control over all other means of exploiting"" underlying work). In light of § 7's explicit preservation of the ""force
and validity"" of the copyright in the ""matter employed,"" the dissent is clearly wrong when it asserts that § 7 was intended to
create a work that is ""completely independent"" of the pre-existing work. Post, at 245. The dissent further errs when it
unjustifiably presumes that § 7 ""limit[s] the enforceability of the derivative copyright."" Post, at 249.

According to the dissent, § 7 requires the derivative work author to obtain ""consent of the proprietor of the copyright""
in the pre-existing work, because ""§ 7 . . . derogate[s] in some manner from the underlying author's copyright rights."" Post, at
241. The more natural inference to be drawn from the requirement of consent is that Congress simply intended that a
derivative work author may not employ a copyrighted work without the author's permission, although of course he can obtain
copyright protection for his own original additions.

The text of § 7 reveals that it is not ""surplusage."" Post, at 244. It does not merely stand for the proposition that authors
receive copyright protection for their original additions. It also limits the effect of the publication of the derivative work on the
underlying work. See supra, at 231 and this page. Nowhere else in the Act does Congress address the treatment to be
afforded derivative works. The principle that additions and improvements to existing works of art receive copyright protection
was settled at the time the 1909 Act was enacted, a principle that Congress simply codified in § 7.

Page 233

Second, the dissent attempts to undercut the plain meaning of § 7 by looking to its legislative history and the
substitution of the term ""publication"" for ""copyright"" in the force or validity clause. According to the dissent, that particular
alteration in the proposed bill ""made clear that it was the publication of the derivative work, not the copyright itself, that was
not to ‘affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright.'"" Post, at 249. Under the 1909 Act, it was necessary to publish
the work with proper notice to obtain copyright. Publication of a work without proper notice automatically sent a work into the
public domain. See generally 2 Nimmer § 7.02[C][1]; 17 U.S.C. § 10 (1976 ed.). The language change was suggested only
to ensure that the publication of a ""new compiled work"" without proper notice, including smaller portions that had not been
previously published and separately copyrighted, would not result in those sections moving into the public domain. See
Note, 44 Brooklyn L.Rev., at 919-920. Had the bill retained the term ""copyright,"" publication alone could have affected the
force or validity of the copyright in the pre-existing work. Thus, far from telling us anything about the copyright in the
derivative work, as the dissent apparently believes it does, the language change merely reflects the practical operation of
the Act.

Third, we think the dissent errs in its reading of § 3. Section 3 provides:

""The copyright provided by this title shall protect all the copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted,
and all matter therein in which copyright is already subsisting, but without extending the duration or scope of such copyright.""
17 U.S.C. § 3 (1976 ed.).

The dissent reasons that § 7, ""read together with § 3, plainly indicates that the copyright on a derivative work extends
‘0 both the new material and that 'in which copyright is already subsisting.’ The author or proprietor of the derivative work

herefore has the statutory right to publish and distribute the entire work."" Post, at 241. Section 3, however,
Page 234

undermines, rather than supports, the dissent's ultimate conclusion that the derivative work is ""completely independent"" of
he pre-existing work. Post, at 245. Section 3 makes three distinct points: (1) copyright protects the copyrightable parts of

he work; (2) copyright extends to parts of the work in which copyright was already obtained, and (3) the duration or scope of
he copyright already obtained will not be extended. Important for this case is that § 3 provides that one can obtain copyright
in a work where parts of the work are already copyrighted. For example, one could obtain a copyright in an opera even
hough three of the songs to be used were already copyrighted. This, and only this, is what is meant in § 7 when it states

hat ""[clompilations or abridgments, adaptations, arrangements, dramatizations, translations or other versions of works .. .
or works republished with new matter shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright under the provisions of this title.""

More important, however, is that under the express language of § 3, one obtains a copyright on the entire work, but
he parts previously copyrighted get copyright protection only according to the ""duration or scope"" of the already existing
copyright. Thus, if an author attempts to obtain copyright in a book derived from a short story, he can obtain copyright on the
book for the full copyright term, but will receive protection of the story parts only for the duration and scope of the rights
previously obtained. Correlatively, if an author attempts to copyright a novel, e.g., about Cinderella, and the story elements
are already in the public domain, the author holds a copyright in the novel, but may receive protection only for his original
additions to the Cinderella story. See McCaleb v. Fox Film Corp., 299 F. 48 (CA5 1924); American Code Co. v. Bensinger,
282 F. 829 (CA2 1922).



--- Page 11 ---
The plain language of the first clause of § 7 ensures that this scheme is carried out with respect to ""[c]ompilations or
abridgments, adaptations, arrangements, dramatizations, translations, or other versions of works in the public domain

Page 235

or of copyrighted works . . . or works republished with new matter,"" /.e., derivative works. The second clause of § 7 clarifies
what might have been otherwise unclear—that the principle in § 3 of preservation of the duration or scope of the subsisting
copyright applies to derivative works, and that neither the scope of the copyright in the matter employed nor the duration of
the copyright in the original work is undermined by publication of the derivative work. See Adventures in Good Eating v. Best
Places to Eat, 131 F.2d 809 , 813, n. 3 (CA7 1942); G. Ricordi & Co. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 189 F.2d 469 (CA2), cert.
denied, 342 U.S. 849 , 72 S.Ct. 77 , 96 L.Ed. 641 (1951) ; Russell v. Price, 612 F.2d, at 1128; see also 1 Nimmer § 3.07.

If one reads the plain language of § 7 and § 3 together, one must conclude that they were enacted in no small part to
ensure that the copyright in the pre-existing work would not be abrogated by the derivative work. Section 7 requires consent
by the author of the pre-existing work before the derivative work may be produced, and both provisions explicitly require that
the copyright in the ""subsisting work"" will not be abrogated by incorporation of the work into another work.

If the dissent's theory were correct, § 3 need only say that ""copyright provided by this title shall protect all the
copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted, and all matter therein in which copyright is already subsisting.""
Instead, § 3 goes on to say that the latter coverage exists ""without extending the duration or scope of such copyright.""
Clearly, the 1909 Act's plain language requires that the underlying work's copyright term exists independently of the
derivative work's term, even when incorporated and even though the derivative work holder owns copyright in the whole
""work."" If the terms must exist separately, each copyright term must be examined for the validity and scope of its grant of
rights.

In this case, the grant of rights in the pre-existing work lapsed and, therefore, the derivative work owners' rights to
Page 236

use those portions of the pre-existing work incorporated into the derivative work expired. Thus, continued use would be
infringing; whether the derivative work may continue to be published is a matter of remedy, an issue which is not before us.
To say otherwise is to say that the derivative work nullifies the ""force"" of the copyright in the ""matter employed."" Whether or
not we believe that this is good policy, this is the system Congress has provided, as evidenced by the language of the 1909
Act and the cases decided under the 1909 Act. Although the dissent's theory may have been a plausible option for a
legislature to have chosen, Congress did not so provide.

Petitioners assert that even if their use of ""It Had to Be Murder"" is unauthorized, it is a fair use and, therefore, not
infringing. At common law, ""the property of the author . . . in his intellectual creation [was] absolute until he voluntarily
part[ed] with the same."" American Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister, 207 U.S. 284 , 299, 28 S.Ct. 72 , 77,52 L.Ed. 208 (1907) .
The fair use doctrine, which is incorporated into the 1976 Act, evolved in response to this absolute rule. See Harper & Row,
471 U.S., at 549-551 , 105 S.Ct., at 2224-2226 . The doctrine is an"" ‘equitable rule of reason,' ""Sony Corp. of America v.
Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S., at 448 , 104 S.Ct., at 792 , which ""permits courts to avoid rigid application of the
copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster."" Iowa State

University Research Foundation, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., 621 F.2d 57 , 60 (CA2 1980). Petitioners contend that
the fair use doctrine should be employed in this case to ""avoid [a] rigid applicatio[n] of the Copyright Act."" Brief for
Petitioners 42.

In 17 U.S.C. § 107, Congress provided examples of fair use, e.g., copying ""for purposes such as criticism, comment,
news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research,"" and listed four

Page 237
nonexclusive factors that a court must consider in determining whether an unauthorized use is not infringing:

""(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for
nonprofit educational purposes;

""(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
""(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
""(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.""

The Court of Appeals determined that the use of Woolrich's story in petitioners’ motion picture was not fair use. We
agree. The motion picture neither falls into any of the categories enumerated in § 107 nor meets the four criteria set forth in §
107. ""[E]very [unauthorized] commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation of the monopoly
privilege that belongs to the owner of the copyright."" Sony Corp. of America v. Universal Studios, Inc., supra, 464 U.S., at



--- Page 12 ---
451 , 104 S.Ct., at 793 . Petitioners received $12 million from the re-release of the motion picture during the renewal term.
863 F.2d, at 1468. Petitioners asserted before the Court of Appeals that their use was educational rather than commercial.
The Court of Appeals found nothing in the record to support this assertion, nor do we.

Applying the second factor, the Court of Appeals pointed out that ""[a] use is less likely to be deemed fair when the
copyrighted work is a creative product."" 863 F.2d, at 1481 (citing Brewer v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 749 F.2d 527 , 529 (CA9
1984)). In general, fair use is more likely to be found in factual works than in fictional works. See 3 Nimmer § 13.05[A], pp.
13-77 to 13-78 (""[A]pplication of the fair use defense [is] greater . . . in the case of factual works than in the case of works of
fiction or fantasy""); cf. Harper & Row, 471 U.S., at 563 , 105 S.Ct., at 2232 (""The law generally recognizes a greater need to
disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fan tasy"").

Page 238
A motion picture based on a fictional short story obviously falls into the latter category.

Examining the third factor, the Court of Appeals determined that the story was a substantial portion of the motion
picture. See 471 U.S., at 564-565 , 105 S.Ct., at 2232-2233 (finding unfair use where quotation from book "" 'took what was
essentially the heart of the book'""). The motion picture expressly uses the story's unique setting, characters, plot, and
sequence of events. Petitioners argue that the story constituted only 20% of the motion picture's story line, Brief for
Petitioners 40, n. 69, but that does not mean that a substantial portion of the story was not used in the motion picture. ""[A]
taking may not be excused merely because it is insubstantial with respect to the infringing work."" Harper & Row, supra, at
565, 105 S.Ct., at 2233 .

The fourth factor is the ""most important, and indeed, central fair use factor."" 3 Nimmer § 13.05[A], p. 13-81. The record
supports the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that re-release of the film impinged on the ability to market new versions of the
story. Common sense would yield the same conclusion. Thus, all four factors point to unfair use. ""This case presents a
classic example of an unfair use: a commercial use of a fictional story that adversely affects the story owner's adaptation
rights."" 863 F.2d, at 1482.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice WHITE, concurring in the judgment.

Although | am not convinced, as the Court seems to be, that the decision in Miller Music Corp. v. Charles N. Daniels.
Inc., 362 U.S. 373 , 80 S.Ct. 792 , 4 L.Ed.2d 804 (1960) , was required by the Copyright Act, neither am | convinced that it
was an impermissible construction of the statute. And because Miller Music, in my view, requires the result reached by the
Court in this case, | concur in the judgment of affirmance.

Section 6 of the Copyright Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 1077, 17 U.S.C. § 7 (1970 ed.) (hereinafter § 7), furthers that purpose;
§ 24 of that Act, 17 U.S.C. § 24 (1970 ed.) (hereinafter § 24), as construed by the Court in this case, does not. It is therefore
appropriate to begin with § 7. !

In a copyright case, as in any other case, the language of the statute provides the starting point..Community for
Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 , 739, 109 S.Ct. 2166 2172, 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989) ; Mills Music, Inc. v.
Snyder, 469 U.S. 153 , 164, 105 S.Ct. 638 , 645, 83 L.Ed.2d 556 (1985) .

Section 7 provides in pertinent part:
""Compilations or abridgments, adaptations, arrangements, dramatizations, translations, or other versions of
Page 240

works in the public domain or of copyrighted works when produced with the consent of the proprietor of the copyright
in such works . . . shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright under the provisions of this title; but the publication of
any such new works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed or any part
thereof, or be construed to imply an exclusive right to such use of the original works, or to secure or extend copyright in such


--- Page 13 ---
original works.""

This statutory provision deals with derivative works—works that include both old material and new material. The plain
language of § 7 confers on the entire derivative work—not just the new material contained therein—the status of all other
works of authorship, that of ""new works subject to copyright under the provisions of this title."" Among those rights is that
specified in § 3 of the 1909 Act, 17 U.S.C. § 3 (1976 ed.), which applies both to composite and derivative works and states
that ""the copyright provided by this Act shall protect all the copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted, and all
matter therein in which copyright is already subsisting, but without extending the duration or scope of such copyright."" In
turn, under § 1, U.S.C. § 1 (1976 ed.), the author or proprietor of the copyright has the right to distribute and publicly perform

the copyrighted derivative work. §§ 1(a), 1(d).2 The statute does not say
Page 241

anything about the duration of the copyright being limited to the underlying work's original term; rather, derivative works
made with the consent of the author and derivative works based on matter in the public domain are treated identically. They
are both given independent copyright protection. Section 7, read together with § 3, plainly indicates that the copyright on a
derivative work extends to both the new material and that ""in which copyright is already subsisting."" § 3. The author or

proprietor of the derivative work therefore has the statutory right to publish and distribute the entire work. $

The structure of § 7 confirms this reading. The statute does not merely provide the derivative author with a right to
copyright but goes on to set limitations and conditions on that copyright. The statute makes ""the consent of the proprietor of
the [underlying] copyright"" a precondition for copyright of the derivative work, a provision that would make little sense if the

copyright provided by § 7 did not derogate in some manner from the underlying author's copyright rights. 4 The
Page 242

statute also directs that the right granted the derivative work proprietor should not ""be construed to imply an exclusive right
to such use of the original works,"" suggesting, by negative implication, that it should be read to include a non-exclusive right
to use of the original works. The provision that publication ""shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright""
also suggests that publication would otherwise have the capacity to affect the force or validity of the original copyright: By
publishing the derivative work

Page 243

without satisfying the notice requirements of the Act, the derivative author would dedicate to the public not only his own
original contribution, but also that of the original author. Conversely, the limitation that publication does not ""secure or
extend copyright in such original works"" would be unnecessary if the copyrighted derivative work did not include within it
some of the material covered by the earlier copyright, or if the term of the derivative copyright did not extend beyond the life
of the original copyright. > Although the derivative copyright protects only the new material contained within the new work,
that limitation is not the product of the limited extent of the copyright—which encompasses both new and old material—but
rather of the specific statutory language restricting its effect against third parties.

Any other interpretation would render the provision largely surplusage. The Copyright Act of 1909 elsewhere accords
protection to ""all the writings of an author,” § 4, including dramatic composition, § 5, and long before the Act of 1909, it was
recognized that the additions and improvements to existing works of art were subject to copyright as original works of
authorship. ’ Congress would hardly have needed to provide for the copyright of derivative works, including the detailed
provisions on the limit of that copyright, if it intended only to accord protection to the improvements to an original work of
authorship. In my opinion, § 7 was intended to do something more: to give the original author the power

Page 245

to sell the right to make a derivative work that upon creation and copyright would be completely independent of the original
work.

The statutory background supports the conclusion that Congress intended the original author to be able to sell the
right to make a derivative work that could be distributed for the full term of the derivative work's copyright protection. At the
time of the enactment of § 7, copyright in the right to dramatize a nondramatic work was a relatively recent innovation with
equivocal support. Until 1870, an author had only the right to prevent the copying or vending of his work in the identical
medium. § The Act of 1870, which gave the author the ""sole liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, completing, copying,
executing, finishing, and vending,"" made a limited start toward further protection, providing that ""authors may reserve the
right to dramatize or to translate their own works."" Ch. 230, § 86, 16 Stat. 212. The identical language was carried over
when the statute was revised in 1873. Rev.Stat. § 4952. The Act of 1891 was a landmark. It gave the same rights to the
""author"" as had the previous statutes, but provided further that ""authors or their assigns shall have exclusive right to
dramatize and translate any of their works for which copyright shall have been obtained under the laws of the United States.
Ch. 565, § 4952, 26 Stat. 1107. The case law was in accord. Although courts were occasionally willing to enjoin abridgments


--- Page 14 ---
as infringing, in 1853 Justice Grier wrote that a dramatization of the novel ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" would not infringe

Page 246

the author's rights in the book, see Stowe v. Thomas, 23 F.Cas. 201, 208 (No. 13,514) (CC ED Pa.1853), 9 and it was not
until after the passage of the 1909 Act that this Court first held that a copy of a literary work in another form than the original

could infringe the author's copyright. See Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U.S. 55 ,32 S.Ct. 20 ,56 L.Ed. 92 (1911) . 1°

The drafts of the copyright bill, considered by the Conferences held by the Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of
Congress in 1905 and 1906, '! had three distinctive features with respect to derivative works: They provided a limited period
of protection from the creation of derivative works during which a derivative work could only be created with ""the consent of
the author or his assigns,"" Brylawski & Goldman D LXV; '? they distinguished between the copyright term for original works
of authorship and for derivative works, according the latter a shorter period of protection; '3 and, finally, they provided that
derivative works produced with the consent of the original author would be considered new works entitled to copyright.
Together these provisions reveal a more complicated set of theoretical premises than is commonly acknowledged. Although
originality of authorship was an essential precondition of copy-

Page 248

right, the duration of the copyright term and the extent of copyright protection rested upon the nature of the work as a whole
rather than the original expression contributed by the copyright author. Moreover, the consent of the underlying author to the
production of a derivative work was to be encouraged and, once given, entitled the derivative work to independence from

he work upon which it was based.

The first two provisions were not included in the Copyright Act, which gave authors the right, during the full term of
copyright, to create or consent to the creation of derivative works which would then enjoy their own copyright protection. But
he third provision which set the conditions upon which an original author would consent and the second author would create
a derivative work entitled to protection under the Copyright Act carried forward the view that the derivative copyright
extended beyond the original contribution of the derivative author. Throughout the debates on the provision, the drafters of
he Copyright Act evinced their understanding that the derivative copyright itself encompassed the whole derivative work.
The first draft of § 7, considered by the second Conference in 1905, would have provided copyright as a new work for a
derivative work ""produced with the consent and authorization of the author of the original,"" without any restrictions on the
effect of that copyright on the copyright in the original work. 2 Brylawski & Goldman, Part D, p. XXXII. By the time of the third
Conference in 1906, the Register of Copyrights expressed his concern that that provision would be read too broadly, adding
he proviso: ""That the copyright thus secured shall not be construed to grant any exclusive right to such use of the original
works, except as that may be obtained by agreement with the author or proprietor thereof."" 3 id., Part E, p. LI. The
implication was that, in the absence of an agreement, the author of the derivative work would have, as a matter of copyright
law, a nonexclusive right ""to such use of the original works.""

Page 249

The final draft presented to Congress at the end of 1906 addressed a parallel problem that the license to use the underlying
material might also detract from the rights of the underlying copyright if the derivative author did not adequately protect the
material on which the copyright was subsisting. To allay this concern, the Register added the language ""no such copyright
shall affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed or any part thereof."" 1 id., Part B, p.
15.

Two significant changes were made during the congressional hearings from 1907 through 1909, but with those
exceptions the provision survived intact. First, in response to the objection that the language of § 6, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 7
(1976 ed.), in conjunction with that of § 3, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 3 (1976 ed.), would be read to give the derivative work
proprietor ""a new term of copyright running on this old matter of his"" and, in that way, provide for perpetual copyright, 4
Brylawski & Goldman, Part J, pp. 132-138 (statement of Mr. Porterfeld); see also id., at 428, Congress limited the
enforceability of the derivative copyright, adding language that publication of the dramatization would not ""secure or extend
copyright in such original works."" § 6, 35 Stat. 1077. Second, in response to the objection that the Register's draft provision
did not address with sufficient precision the possibility that failure of the derivative copyright would allow the underlying work
to enter the public domain, Congress substituted the word ""publication"" for ""copyright"" in the ""force or validity"" clause.
Congress thus made clear that it was the publication of the derivative work, not the copyright itself, that was not to ""affect

the force or validity of any subsisting copyright."" /bid. '4

Page 250

The legislative history confirms that the copyright in derivative works not only gives the second creative product the
monopoly privileges of excluding others from the unconsented use of the new work, but also allows the creator to publish his
or her own work product. The authority to produce the derivative work, which includes creative contributions by both the
original author and the second artist, is dependent upon the consent of the proprietor of the underlying copyright. But once
that consent has been obtained, and a derivative work has been created and copyrighted in accord with that consent, ""a


--- Page 15 ---
right of property spr[ings] into existence,"" Edmonds v. Stern, 248 F. 897, 898 (CA2 1918), that Congress intended to protect.
Publication of the derivative work does not ""affect the force or validity"" of the underlying copyright except to the extent that it
gives effect to the consent of the original proprietor. That owner—and in this case, the owner of a renewal of the original
copyright—retains full dominion and control over all other means of exploiting that work of art, including the right to authorize
other derivative works. The original copyright may have relatively little value because the creative contribution of the second
artist is far more significant than the original con-

Page 251

tribution, but that just means that the rewards for creativity are being fairly allocated between the two artists whose
combined efforts produced the derivative work.

Ill
Nothing in § 24 requires a different result. The portion of that section dealing with copyright renewals provides:

""[T]he author of such work, if still living, or the widow, widower, or children of the author, if the author be not living, . . .
shall be entitled to a renewal and extension of the copyright in such work for a further term of twenty-eight years when
application for such renewal and extension shall have been made to the copyright office and duly registered therein within
one year prior to the expiration of the original term of copyright."" 17 U.S.C. § 24 (1976 ed.).

That statute limits the renewal rights in a copyright to the specified statutory beneficiaries, ""completely dissevering the
title, breaking up the continuance . . . and vesting an absolutely new title eo nomine in the persons designated."" White-Smith
Music Publishing Co. v. Goff, 187 F. 247, 250 (CA1 1911). Since copyright is a creature of statute and since the statute
gives the author only a contingent estate, with ""the widow, widower, or children"" as remaindermen, the author ""ha[s] only an

expectancy to assign"" for the second term._Miller Music Corp. v. Charles N. Daniels, Inc., 362 U.S. 373 , 375, 80 S.Ct. 792 ,
794, 4 L.Ed.2d 804 (1960) . The original author may not sell more than he owns. He may not convey the second-term rights

to print or copy the underlying work or to create additional derivative works from it. See Gilliam v. American Broadcasting
Cos., 538 F.2d 14 , 21 (CA2 1976); G. Ricordi & Co. v. Paramount Pictures Inc., 189 F.2d 469 (CA2), cert. denied, 342 U.S.
849 , 72 S.Ct. 77 , 96 L.Ed. 641 (1951) . 1 Nor may the derivative author dedi-

Page 252

cate the underlying art to the public by failing to renew his copyright. See Filmvideo Releasing Corp. v. Hastings, 668 F.2d
91 , 93 (CA2 1981): Russell v. Price, 612 F.2d 1123 , 1128 (CA9 1979). 16 Even if the alienation of second-term rights would
be in the author's best interest, providing funds when he is most in need, the restriction on sale of the corpus is a necessary
consequence of Congress' decision to provide two terms of copyright.

Neither § 24 nor any other provision of the Act, however, expressly or by implication, prevents the author from
exercising any of his other statutory rights during the original term of the copyright. The author of the underlying work may
contract to sell his work at a bargain price during the original term of the copyright. That agreement would be enforceable
even if performance of the contract diminished the value of the copyright to the owner of the renewal interest. Similarly, the
original author may create and copyright his own derivative work; the right of an assignee or legatee to receive that work by
assignment or bequest should not be limited by the interests of the owners of the renewal copyright in the underlying work.
Section 1 of the Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1 (1976 ed.), gives the author the right to dramatize his own work without any apparent
restriction. Such use might appear, at the time or in retrospect, to be improvident and a waste of the asset. Whatever harm
the proprietor of the renewal copyright might suffer, however, is a consequence of the enjoyment by the author of the rights
granted him by Congress.

The result should be no different when the author exercises his right to consent to creation of a derivative work by
another. By designating derivative works as ""new works""

Page 253

that are subject to copyright and accorded the two terms applicable to original works, Congress evinced its intention that the
derivative copyright not lapse upon termination of the original author's interest in the underlying copyright. The continued
publication of the derivative work, after the expiration of the original term of the prior work, does not infringe any of the
statutory successor's rights in the renewal copyright of the original work. The author's right to sell his derivative rights is
exercised when consent is conveyed and completed when the derivative work is copyrighted. At that point, prior to the end
of the first term, the right to prevent publication of the derivative work is no longer one of the bundle of rights attaching to the
copyright. The further agreement to permit use of the underlying material during the renewal term does not violate § 24
because at the moment consent is given and the derivative work is created and copyrighted, a new right of property comes
into existence independent of the original author's copyright estate.

As an ex post matter, it might appear that the original author could have negotiated a better contract for his consent to
creation of a derivative work, but Congress in § 24 was not concerned with giving an author a second chance to renegotiate
his consent to the production of a derivative work. '” It provided explicitly that, once consent was given, the derivative work
was entitled as a matter of copyright law to treatment as a ""new wor|k]."" § 7. Ironically, by restricting the


--- Page 16 ---
Page 254

author's ability to consent to creation of a derivative work with independent existence, the Court may make it practically
impossible for the original author to sell his derivative rights late in the original term and to reap the financial and artistic
advantage that comes with the creation of a derivative work. '8 Unless § 24 is to overwhelm § 7, the consent of the original
author must be given effect whether or not it intrudes into the renewal term of the original copyright.

A putative author may sell his work to a motion picture company who will have greater use for it, by becoming an
employee and making the work ""for hire."" The 1909 Act gave the employer the right to renew the copyright in such
circumstances. '9 In addition, when an author intends that his work be used as part of a joint work, the copyright law gives
the joint author common authority to exploit the underlying work and renew the copyright. 2° The Court today

Page 255

holds, however, that the independent entrepreneur, who does not go into the company's employ and who intends to make
independent use of his work, does not also have the same right to sell his consent to produce a derivative work that can be
distributed and publicly performed during the full term of its copyright protection. That result is perverse and cannot have

been what Congress intended. 21

The critical flaw in the Court's analysis is its implicit endorsement of the Court of Appeals reasoning that:

""'If Miller Music makes assignment of the full renewal rights in the underlying copyright unenforceable when the author
dies before effecting renewal of the copyright, then a fortiori, an assignment of part of the rights in the underlying work, the
right to produce a movie version, must also be unenforceable if the author dies before effecting renewal of the underlying
copyright.'"" Ante, at 215-216.

That reasoning would be valid if the sole basis for the protection of the derivative work were the contractual
assignment of copyright, but Woolrich did not just assign the rights to produce a movie version the way an author would
assign the publisher rights to copy and vend his work. Rather, he expressed his consent to production of a derivative work
under § 7. The possession of a copyright on a properly created derivative work gives the proprietor rights superior to those
of

Page 256

a mere licensee. As Judge Friendly concluded, this position is entirely consistent with relevant policy considerations. 22
In my opinion, a fair analysis of the entire 1909 Act, with special attention to § 7, indicates that the statute embodied
the same policy choice that continues to be reflected in the 1976 Act. Section 101 of the Act provides:

""A derivative work prepared under authority of the grant before its termination may continue to be utilized under
the terms of the grant after its termination, but this privilege does not extend to the preparation after the termination of other
derivative works based upon the copyrighted work covered by the terminated grant."" 17 U.S.C.App. § 304(c)(6)(A).

| respectfully dissent.

1. The Copyright Act of 1976 (1976 Act), 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seg. (1988 ed.), codified the definition of a "" ‘derivative work,'"" as ""a work based upon one or
more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version . . . or any other form in which
a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.” § 101.

2. Neither Miller Music nor Fred Fisher decided the question of when the renewal rights vest, /.e., whether the renewal rights vest upon commencement
of the registration period, registration, or the date on which the original term expires and the renewal term begins. We have no occasion to address the
issue here.

3. Title 17 U.S.C. § 106 (1988 ed.) codifies the various rights a copyright holder possesses: ""[T]he owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive
rights to do and to authorize any of the following:

""(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;
""(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;
""(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;

""(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the
copyrighted work publicly; and

""(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual
images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly.""

1. Although the Court of Appeals determined the rights of the parties by looking to the 1909 Act, respondent now argues that the 1976 Act is applicable.
At the time petitioners secured their copyright in the film in 1954, and respondent renewed his copyright in the short story in 1969, the Copyright Act of
1909 was in effect. There is no evidence that Congress in the Copyright Act of 1976 intended to abrogate rights created under the previous Act. |
therefore take it as evident that while the cause of action under which respondent sues may have been created by the 1976 Act, the respective property
rights of the parties are determined by the statutory grant under the 1909 Act. See Roth v. Pritikin. 710 F.2d 934 , 938 (CA2), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 961 ,
104 S.Ct. 394 , 78 L.Ed.2d 337 (1983) ;_International Film Exchange, Ltd. v. Corinth Films, Inc., 621 F.Supp. 631 (SDNY 1985) ; Jaszi, When Works

& D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 1.11, p. 1-96 (1989) (hereinafter Nimmer) (no explicit statement of a legislative intent to apply the current Act
retroactively).

2. Section 1 of the 1909 Act, 35 Stat. 1075, provides in pertinent part:
""That any person entitled thereto, upon complying with the provisions of this Act, shall have the exclusive right:

""(a) To print, reprint, publish, copy, and vend the copyrighted work;

""(d) To perform or represent the copyrighted work publicly if it be a drama . . .; and to exhibit, perform, represent, produce, or reproduce it in any manner
or by any method whatsoever.""

In its response to this dissent, the Court completely ignores the plain language of § 1.

3. The Court states that this reading of § 7 is ""creative,"" has not been adopted by any Court of Appeals in the history of the 1909 Act, and has not been
argued by petitioners. Ante, at 230. Although | am flattered by this comment, | must acknowledge that the credit belongs elsewhere. In their briefs to this
Court, petitioners and their amici argue that § 7 created an independent but limited copyright in the entire derivative work entitled to equal treatment with
original works under the renewal and duration provisions of § 24. Brief for Petitioners 14-15, 17, 21, 29-30; Brief for Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., et
al., as Amici Curiae 11, 13, 15. That was also the central argument of Judge Friendly in his opinion for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, see
Rohauer v. Killiam Shows, Inc., 551 F.2d 484 , 487-488, 489-490, 493-494, cert. denied, 431 U.S. 949 , 97 S.Ct. 2666 , 53 L.Ed.2d 266 (1977) , and
Judge Thompson dissenting from the panel decision below, see Abend v. MCA, Inc., 863 F.2d 1465 , 1484-1487 (CA9 1988). Indeed, Judge Friendly
only addressed the equities with great reservation, 551 F.2d, at 493, after ""a close reading of the language of what is now § 7."" /d., at 489.

4. The drafters of the 1909 Act were well aware of the difficulty of contacting distant authors who no longer wished to enforce their copyright rights. In §
24,

for example, Congress provided that a proprietor could secure and renew copyright on a composite work when the individual contributions were not
separately registered. The provision was apparently addressed to the difficulties such proprietors had previously faced in locating and obtaining the
consent of authors at the time of renewal. See H.R.Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 15 (1909); 1 Legislative History of the 1909 Copyright Act, Part
C, p. 56 (E. Brylawski & A. Goldman eds. 1976) (statement of Mr. Elder) (hereinafter Brylawski & Goldman); 5 id., Part K pp. 18-19 (statement of Mr.
Putnam); id., at K77 (statement of Mr. Hale). See also Elder, Duration of Copyright, 14 Yale L.J. 417, 418 (1905). The effect of the § 7 consent
requirement under the Court's reading should not only be to forbid the author of the derivative work to ""employ a copyrighted work without the author's
permission,"" ante, at 232, but also to penalize him by depriving him both of the right to use his own new material and, in theory, of the right to protect that
new material against use by the public. It is most unlikely that a Congress which intended to promote the creation of literary works would have
conditioned the protection of new material in an otherwise original work on ""consent"" of an original author who did not express the desire to protect his
own work.

The Court of Appeals thought that the failure of Congress to grant an ""exemption"" to derivative works similar to that it granted composite works
demonstrated its intention that derivative works lapse upon termination of the underlying author's copyright interest. 863 F.2d, at 1476. Section 24,
however, does not exempt composite works from the renewal provision, but merely provides for their renewal by the proprietor alone when the individual
contributions are not separately copyrighted. See 2 Nimmer § 9.03[B], p. 9-36. Moreover, the “author,” entitled to renewal under § 24, refers back to the
author of the original work and the derivative work. Congress did not need to make special provision for the derivative work in § 24 because it already did
so in § 7, making it a new work ""subject to copyright under the provisions of this title."" 17 U.S.C. § 7 (1976 ed.).

5: It is instructive to compare the language of § 7 to that used by Congress in 1976 to indicate that copyright in a derivative work under the new Act
attached only to the new material:

""The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the material contributed by the author of such work, as distinguished from the
preexisting material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material. The copyright in such work is independent
of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in the preexisting material."" 17 U.S.C. §
103(b) (1988 ed.).

6. | thus agree with the Court that publication of a derivative work cannot extend the scope or duration of the copyright in the original work, ante, at 234-
235, and that the underlying work's copyright term exists independently of the derivative work's term. Ante, at 231-232, 235. As much is clear from the
language of § 7, which extends the copyright to the entire work, but then limits the effect of that copyright. | further agree that the original author's right to
""consent"" to the copyright of a derivative work terminates when the statutory term of the copyright in the underlying work expires. Ante, at 235. As |
explain, infra at 251-253, that result follows from the language of § 24. | do not agree, however, that the statutory right to distribute and publicly perform a
derivative work that has been copyrighted with the original author's consent during the original term of the underlying work is limited by the validity and
scope of the original copyright. Ante, at 235. Section 7, in conjunction with § 24, gives the derivative author two full terms of copyright in the entire
derivative work both when the original work is used with the consent of the original author and when the original work is in the public domain. My
conclusion thus rests upon the language of the statute. The Court's contrary assertion, that if the right to publish the derivative work extended beyond the
original term of the underlying work it would ""nulli[fy] the ‘force’ of the copyright in the 'matter employed,'"" ante, at 236, simply begs the question of the
extent of the original author's statutory rights. Even after the derivative work has been copyrighted, the original author retains all of his statutory rights,
including the right to consent to the creation of additional derivative works during both the original and renewal terms. Moreover, even if the derivative
work did derogate from the force of the original work, the provision to which the Court apparently refers states only that "" publication "" of a derivative work
—and not consent to its creation—shall not affect the force of the copyright in the matter employed. The Court can avoid making § 7 complete surplus
(and allow it to limit the rights of both the original and the derivative author) only by distorting the plain language of that provision.

7. See, e.g., Gray v. Russell, 10 F.Cas. 1035, 1037-1038 (No. 5,728) (CC Mass.1839); Emerson v. Davies, 8 F.Cas. 615, 618-619 (No. 4,436) (CC
Mass.1845); Shook v. Rankin, 21 F.Cas. 1335, 1336 (No. 12,804) (CC N.D.III.1875). The Court's difficulty in explaining away the language of § 7 is not
surprising. The authority upon whom it almost exclusively relies, see ante, at 223, had the same difficulty, stating at one point that ""[t]he statutory text was
somewhat ambiguous,” 1 Nimmer, p. 3-22.2, and admitting at another that under his reading of the Copyright Act the provision was largely irrelevant. See
id., at 3-29, n. 17 ([I]t is consent referred to in Sec. 7, but which would have efficacy as a matter of contract law even without Sec. 7""). At least in the
Copyright Act of 1909, however, Congress knew exactly what it was doing.

8. The Act of 1790, passed by the First Congress, provided ""the sole right and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing and vending"" the copyrighted work.
§ 1, 1 Stat. 124. Its successor, the Act of 1831, repeated the language that the author of a copyrighted work ""shall have the sole right and liberty of
printing, reprinting, publishing, and vending"" the work. Ch. 16, § 1, 4 Stat. 436. Benjamin Kaplan has written that the Act of 1870 constituted an


--- Page 18 ---
“enlargement of the monopoly to cover the conversion of a work from one to another artistic medium."" An Unhurried View of Copyright 32 (1967)
(hereinafter Kaplan).

9. ""By the publication of Mrs. Stowe's book, the creations of the genius and imagination of the author have become as much public property as those of
Homer or Cervantes. . . . All her conceptions and inventions may be used and abused by imitators, play-rights and poetasters [They are no longer her
own—those who have purchased her book, may clothe them in English doggerel, in German or Chinese prose. Her absolute dominion and property in
the creations of her genius and imagination have been voluntarily relinquished.] All that now remains is the copyright of her book; the exclusive right to
print, reprint and vend it, and those only can be called infringers of her rights, or pirates of her property, who are guilty of printing, publishing, importing or
vending without her license, ‘copies of her book.'"" Stowe v. Thomas, 23 F.Cas., at 208 (footnote omitted).

It appears that at least as late as 1902, English copyright law also did not recognize that a dramatization could infringe an author's rights in a book. See
E. MacGillivray, A Treatise Upon The Law of Copyright 114 (1902); see also Reade v. Conquist, 9 C.B.N.S. 755, 142 Eng.Rep. 297 (C.P.1861); Coleman
v. Wathen, 5 T.R. 245, 101 Eng.Rep. 137 (K.B.1793). Even after the passage of the Act of 1870, one American commentator flatly declared: ""Even if the
public recitation of a book, in which copyright exists, is not made from memory, but takes the form of a public reading, from the work itself, of the whole
or portions of it, this would not amount to an infringement of the author's copyright."" 2 J. Morgan, Law of Literature 700-701 (1875).

10. ""The American cases reflect no recognition that unauthorized dramatization could infringe rights in a nondramatic work until the 1870 copyright
revision provided authors with the same option to reserve dramatization rights that they were afforded with respect to translation. By then, dramatizations
like other derivative works—already had enjoyed almost a century of substantial independence. During this period, courts construing federal copyright
statutes were willing to extend protection to them, but were reluctant to interfere with their unauthorized production."" Jaszi 783.

See also Goldstein, Derivative Rights and Derivative Works in Copyright, 30 J. Copyright Society 209, 211-215 (1983).

11. The history of the Copyright Act of 1909 is recounted in Justice Frankfurter's opinion for the Court in Fred Fisher Music Co. v. M. Witmark & Sons,_318
U.S. 643 , 652, 63 S.Ct. 773 , 777, 87 L.Ed. 1055 (1943) .

12. The first draft of the copyright bill considered in 1905 provided that if the author or his assigns did not make or authorize to be made a dramatization
within 10 years of the date of registration, the work could be used for dramatization by other authors. 2 Brylawski & Goldman, Part D, p. LXV. A similar
provision appeared in the third draft of the bill considered by the Conference the following year, 3 id., Part E, p. XL, and in the bill submitted by the
Register of Copyrights to Congress. 1 id., Part B, pp. 37-38. The provision was eventually dropped during hearings in Congress and was never adopted
into law.

13. The first draft provided identical terms for both original works of authorship and derivative works, 2 id., Part D, pp. XXXVII-XXXVIII. Successive drafts
gave the copyright in the original work to the author for his life plus 50 years, but limited the copyright in a derivative work to 50 years. 3 id., Part E, pp.
LIII-LIV; 1 id., Part B, pp. 34-35. The single term was rejected at a late date by Congress and the final Act eventually provided the same two-term
copyright for original and derivative works. See generally B. Ringer, Renewal of Copyright (1960), reprinted as Copyright Law Revision Study No. 31,
prepared for the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 115-121 (1961).

14. The amendment apparently emerged from dialogue between Mr. W.B. Hale, representative of the American Law Book Company, and Senator Smoot:
""Mr. Hale: 'There is another verbal criticism | should like to make in section 6 of the Kittredge bill, which also relates to compilations, abridgments, etc.’
""The Chairman [Senator Smoot]. 'I think it is the same in the other bills.’

""Mr. Hale. 'Yes; it is the same in all the bills. | heartily agree with and am in favor of that section; but in line 12, in lieu of the words ""but no such copyright
shall effect the force or validity,"" etc., | would prefer to substitute these words: ""and the publication of any such new work shall not affect the copyright,”
etc. .. . Under the act, as it stands now, it says the copyright shall not affect it. | would like to meet the case of a new compiled work, within the meaning
of this clause, that is not copyrighted, or where, by reason of some accident the copyright fails. That should not affect the original copyrights in the works
that have entered into and formed a part of this new compiled work. It does not change the intent of this section in any way.'"" 5, Brylawski & Goldman,
Part K, p. 78.

15. In Ricordi, the author of the derivative work not only produced a new derivative work, but also breached his covenant not to distribute the work, after
the first term of the underlying copyright. As Justice WHITE has explained, "" Ricordi merely held that the licensee of a copyright holder may not prepare a
new derivative work based upon the copyrighted work after termination of the grant.""_Mills Music, Inc. v. Snyder, 469 U.S. 153 , 183, n. 7, 105 S.Ct. 638 ,
655, n. 7, 83 L.Ed.2d 556 (1985) (dissenting opinion).

18. The result follows as well from the ""force and validity"" clause of § 7.
17. Congress was primarily concerned with the ability of the author to exploit his own work of authorship:

""Your committee, after full consideration, decided that it was distinctly to the advantage of the author to preserve the renewal period. It not infrequently
happens that the author sells his copyright outright to a publisher for a comparatively small sum. If the work proves to be a great success and lives
beyond the term of twenty-eight years, your committee felt that it should be the exclusive right of the author to take the renewal term, and the law should
be framed as is the existing law, so that he could not be deprived of that right."" H.R.Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., at 14.

18. The creation of a derivative work often is in the best interests of both the original author and his statutory successors. As one commentator has noted:

""The movie Rear Window became a selling point for anthologies containing the Woolrich story. The musical play Cats no doubt sent many people who
dimly remembered the Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock as the chief, if not the only oeuvre of T.S. Eliot to the bookstore for Old Possum's Book of
Practical Cats."" Weinreb, Fair's Fair: A Comment on the Fair Use Doctrine, 103 Harv.L.Rev. 1137, 1147 (1990).

19. See 17 U.S.C. § 24 (1976 ed.) (""[I]n the case of . . . any work copyrighted by . . . an employer for whom such work is made for hire, the proprietor of
such copyright shall be entitled to a renewal and extension of the copyright in such work for the further term of twenty-eight years""). See also Ellingson,
Copyright Exception for Derivative Works and the Scope of Utilization, 56 Ind.L.J. 1, 11 (1980-1981).

20. See Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. Jerry Vogel Music Co., 161 F.2d 406 (CA2 1946) ;_ Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Jerry Vogel Music Co., 140 F.2d
266 (CA2 1944) . In the ""12th Street Rag"" case, Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. Jerry Vogel Music Co., 221 F.2d 569 (CA2 1955) , the Court of Appeals held
that a work of music, intended originally to stand on its own as an instrumental, could become a joint work when it was later sold to a publisher who
commissioned lyrics to be written for it. The decision, which would give the creator of the derivative work and the underlying author a joint interest in the
derivative work, accomplishes the same result that | believe § 7 does expressly.



--- Page 19 ---
21. ""The effect of the Fred Fisher [, 318 U.S. 643 , 63 S.Ct. 773 , 87 L.Ed. 1055 (1943) ,] case and other authorities is that if the author is dead when the
twenty-eighth year comes round, the renewal reverts, free and clear, to his widow, children, and so forth in a fixed order of precedency; but if the author is
alive in that year, the original sale holds and there is no reversion. The distinction is hard to defend and may operate in a peculiarly perverse way where
on the faith of a transfer from the now-deceased author, the transferee has created a ‘derivative work,’ say a movie based on the original novel."" Kaplan
112.

22. ""To such extent as it may be permissible to consider policy considerations, the equities lie preponderantly in favor of the proprietor of the derivative
copyright. In contrast to the situation where an assignee or licensee has done nothing more than print, publicize and distribute a copyrighted story or
novel, a person who with the consent of the author has created an opera or a motion picture film will often have made contributions literary, musical and
economic, as great as or greater than the original author. As pointed out in the Bricker article [Bricker, Renewal and Extension of Copyright, 29
S.Cal.L.Rev. 23, 33 (1955) ], the purchaser of derivative rights has no truly effective way to protect himself against the eventuality of the author's death
before the renewal period since there is no way of telling who will be the surviving widow, children or next of kin or the executor until that date arrives. To
be sure, this problem exists in equal degree with respect to assignments or licenses of underlying copyright, but in such cases there is not the
countervailing consideration that large and independently copyrightable contributions will have been made by the transferee.""_Rohauer v. Killiam Shows.
Inc., 551 F.2d 484 , 493 (CA2), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 949 , 97 S.Ct. 2666 , 53 L.Ed.2d 266 (1977) .

MEMORANDUM & ORDER

DEBORAH A. BATTS, District Judge.

This matter is now before the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment. Defendants Richard Prince, Gagosian
Gallery, Inc., and Lawrence Gagosian seek a determination that their use of Plaintiffs copyrighted photographs was a fair
use under the relevant section of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 107(1)-(4), and that Plaintiff's claim for conspiracy to
violate his rights under the Copyright Act is barred by law. + Plaintiff seeks summary judgment in his favor on the issue of
liability for copyright infringement.

For reasons detailed herein, the Court finds (1) that Defendants' infringing use of Plaintiff's copyrighted photographs
was not fair use under the Copyright Act; and (2) that Plaintiff's conspiracy claim is

[784 F.Supp.2d 343]
barred by law. Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED in part, and Plaintiff's Motion is GRANTED in its entirety.
I. BACKGROUND

Familiarity with the affidavits, declarations, deposition transcripts, and other evidence before the Court is assumed, and
the undisputed facts are set forth here only briefly.

Plaintiff Patrick Cariou (“Plaintiff or “Cariou”) is a professional photographer. PC Tr. 45-46, 279-80. 2 Cariou spent
time with Rastafarians in Jamaica over the course of some six years, gaining their trust and taking their portraits. PC Tr. 34—
48. In 2000, Cariou published a book of photographs which were taken during his time in Jamaica. Brooks Decl. Ex. L. The
book, titled Yes, Rastaand released by PowerHouse Books ( “Yes, Rasta”), contained both portraits of Rastafarian
individuals (and others) in Jamaica and landscape photos taken by Cariou in Jamaica. 3 /d.

Cariou testified at length about the creative choices he made in determining which equipment to use in taking his
photos, the staging choices he made when composing and taking individual photos, and the techniques and processes he
used (and directed others to use) when developing the photos. See e.g., PC Tr. 49-66, 133-34, 137-38, 143-44, 152, 169.
Cariou also testified that he was heavily involved in the layout, editing, and printing of the Yes, Rastabook. /d.;PC Tr. at
180-208. According to the colophon page included in Yes, Rasta, Cariou is the sole copyright holder in the images that
appear in Yes, Rasta. Brooks Decl. Ex. L.

Defendant Richard Prince (“Prince”) is a well-known “appropriation artist” who has shown at numerous museums and
other institutions, including a solo show at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. RP Aff. 44 3, 5. Defendant Gagosian
Gallery, Inc. (the “Gallery”) is an art dealer and gallery which represents Prince and markets the artworks he creates. LG Tr.
22-25; RP Tr. 270, 294. Defendant Lawrence Gagosian (“Gagosian’; collectively with the Gallery, the “Gagosian
Defendants”) is the President, founder, and owner of the Gagosian Gallery, Inc. LG Tr. at 16. 4

In or about December 2007 through February 2008, Prince showed artwork at the Eden Rock hotel in St. Barths. See
RP Tr. at 187-88. Among the works shown was a collage entitled Canal Zone (2007), which consisted of 35 photographs
torn from Yes, Rasta and attached to a wooden backer board. See RP Decl. Comp. Ex. A. at 20-24; see also RP Tr. at 179-
80. Prince painted over some portions of the 35 photographs, and used only portions of some of the photos, while others
were used in their entirety or nearly so. See generally RP Decl. Comp. Ex. A at 20-24. Though Canal Zone (2007) was not
sold, Prince sold other artworks at that show through Gagosian. RP Tr. 187-88, 197-98. Portions of Canal Zone (2007)
were reproduced in a magazine article about Prince's Canal Zone show at the Gagosian Gallery. RP Tr. at 198-201. Prince
intended that Canal Zone (2007)

[784 F.Supp.2d 344]


--- Page 2 ---
serve as an introduction to the characters he intended to use in a screenplay and in a planned series of artworks, also to be
entitled Canal Zone. RP Aff. 4 48.

Prince ultimately completed 29 paintings in his contemplated Canal Zone series, 28 of which included images taken
from Yes, Rasta. 5 See RP Decl. Comp. Ex. A. Some of the paintings, like “Graduation (2008)” and “Canal Zone (2008),”
consist almost entirely of images taken from Yes, Rasta, albeit collaged, enlarged, cropped, tinted, and/or over-painted,
while others, like “Ile de France (2008)” use portions of Yes, Rasta Photos as collage elements and also include appropriated
photos from other sources and more substantial original painting. 8 See RP Decl. Comp. Ex. A (comparing Prince paintings
with Cariou Photos used therein); compare Brooks Decl. Ex. M (Canal Zone catalog) with Brooks Decl. Ex. L ( Yes, Rasta
book). In total, Prince admits using at least 41 Photos from Yes, Rastaas elements of Canal Zone Paintings. RP Decl. § 24.

The Gallery showed 22 of the 29 Canal Zone paintings at one of its Manhattan locations from November 8, 2008 to
December 20, 2008. Brooks Decl. Ex. M at 1; LG Tr. at 25, 50; RP Aff. at Ex. A. The Gallery also published and sold an
exhibition catalog from that show, similarly entitled Canal Zone, which contained reproductions of many of the Canal Zone
Paintings (including some Paintings which were not shown at the Gallery) and photographs of Yes, Rasta Photos in Prince's
studio. See Brooks Decl. Ex. M ( Canal Zone exhibition catalog). The Gagosian employee who was the Managing Editor of
the catalog testified that she never inquired as to the source of the Rastafarian photographs contained therein. AC Tr. at 42.

Other than by private sale to individuals Cariou knew and liked, the Photos have never been sold or licensed for use
other than in the Yes, Rasta book. PC Tr. 86-94. However, Cariou testified that he was negotiating with gallery owner
Christiane Celle (“Celle”), who planned to show and sell prints of the Yes, Rasta Photos at her Manhattan gallery, prior to

he Canal Zone show's opening. PC Tr. at 96-98; see CC Tr. 39-40, 42-44. Cariou also testified that he intended in the
uture to issue artists’ editions of the Photos, which would be offered for sale to collectors. PC Tr. 92-94; 97-98.

Celle originally planned to exhibit between 30 and 40 of the Photos at her gallery, with multiple prints of each to be sold
at prices ranging from $3,000.00 to $20,000.00, depending on size. CC Tr. at 40-42, 46, 66-68, 127-28, 153-55. She also
planned to have Yes, Rasta reprinted for a book signing to be held during the show at her gallery. CC Tr. at 87-88, 155-56.
However, when Celle became aware of the Canal Zone exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery, she cancelled the show she and
Cariou had discussed. PC Tr. at 98; CC Tr. 63-64, 71. Celle testified that she decided to cancel the show because she did
not want to seem to be capitalizing on Prince's success and notoriety, CC Tr. at 89, 105-06, and because she did not want
‘0 exhibit work which had been “done already” at another gallery, CC Tr. 89, 91, 105.

[784 F.Supp.2d 345]
Il. DISCUSSION A. Summary Judgment

A district court should grant summary judgment when there is “no genuine issue as to any material fact,” and the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see also Hermes Int'l v. Lederer de Paris Fifth
Ave., Inc., 219 F.3d 104 , 107 (2d Cir.2000). Genuine issues of material fact cannot be created by mere conclusory
allegations; summary judgment is appropriate only when, “after drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of a non-movant,
no reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of that party.” Heublein v. United States, 996 F.2d 1455 , 1461 (2d Cir.1993)
(citing Matsushita Elec. Industr. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.. 475 U.S. 574 , 587-88, 106 S.Ct. 1348 , 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) ).

In assessing when summary judgment should be granted, “there must be more than a ‘scintilla of evidence’ in the non-
movant's favor; there must be evidence upon which a fact-finder could reasonably find for the non-movant.” /d. (citing
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby. Inc., 477 U.S. 242 , 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) ). While a court must always
“resolv[e] ambiguities and draw [ ] reasonable inferences against the moving party,” Knight v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., 804 F.2d 9 ,
11 (2d Cir.1986) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252 , 106 S.Ct. 2505 ), the non-movant may not rely upon “mere speculation
or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment.” /d. at 12. Instead, when the
moving party has documented particular facts in the record, “the opposing party must set forth specific facts showing that
there is a genuine issue for trial.” Williams v. Smith. 781 F.2d 319 , 323 (2d Cir.1986) (quotation omitted). Establishing such
facts requires going beyond the allegations of the pleadings, as the moment has arrived “to put up or shut up.”_Weinstock v.
Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33 , 41 (2d Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Unsupported allegations in the pleadings thus cannot
create a material issue of fact. /d.

A court faced with cross-motions for summary judgment need not “grant judgment as a matter of law for one side or the
other,” but “ ‘must evaluate each party's motion on its own merits, taking care in each instance to draw all reasonable

inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.’ ”_Heublein. Inc. v. United States. 996 F.2d 1455 , 1461
(2d Cir.1993) ( quoting Schwabenbauer v. Bd. of Educ. of Olean, 667 F.2d 305 , 313-14 (2d Cir.1981)).

To prevail on a copyright infringement claim, two elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2)
copying of constituent elements of the work that are original. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 548 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; Feist
Publ'ns., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340 , 348, 363,111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (holding that
alphabetical arrangement of names in telephone directory was not protected by copyright, since alphabetical arrangement
“is not only unoriginal, it is practically inevitable.”). To be “original,” a copyrighted work must have been independently



--- Page 3 ---
created by the author and must possess “at least some minimal degree of creativity,” although “the requisite level of
creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice.” /d. at 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282 . “The vast majority of works make
the grade quite easily, as they possess some creative spark, ‘no matter how crude, humble or obvious' it might be.” /d.
(citation omitted).

“[T]he applicability of [the fair use defense to copyright infringement] presents mixed questions of law and fact,” Arista
Records, LLC v. Doe 3,604 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.2010) ( citing

[784 F.Supp.2d 346]

Harper & Row Pubs., Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) ), but may
nevertheless be determined on a motion for summary judgment where the record contains facts sufficient to evaluate each
of the statutory factors, Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 560 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 .

B. Copyright in the Photos

Cariou's ownership of a valid copyright in the Photos is undisputed. However, Defendants assert that Cariou's Photos
are mere compilations of facts concerning Rastafarians and the Jamaican landscape, arranged with minimum creativity in a
manner typical of their genre, and that the Photos are therefore not protectable as a matter of law, despite Plaintiff's
extensive testimony about the creative choices he made in taking, processing, developing, and selecting them. 2

Unfortunately for Defendants, it has been a matter of settled law for well over one hundred years that creative
photographs are worthy of copyright protection even when they depict real people and natural environments. See, e.g.,
Burrow-_Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony.111 U.S. 53 , 60,4 S.Ct. 279 , 28 L.Ed. 349 (1884) (photographic portrait of
Oscar Wilde was original creative work, since photographer posed the subject, selected his clothing, background, light and
shade, and “suggest[ed] and evok[ed] the desired expression”); Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301 , 307 (2d Cir.1992)
(‘Elements of originality in a photograph may include posing the subjects, lighting, angle, selection of film and camera,
evoking the desired expression, and almost any other variant involved.”), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 934 , 113 S.Ct. 365 , 121
L.Ed.2d 278 (1992) ; Mannion v. Coors Brewing Co., 377 F.Supp.2d 444 , 450(S.D.N.Y.2005) (“Almost any photograph ‘may
claim the necessary originality to support a copyright.’ ”) (citation omitted); Eastern Am. Trio Prods., Inc. v. Tang Elec. Corp.
97 F.Supp.2d 395 , 417 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (photographs of “common industrial items” were protectable);/Monster Comm's, Inc.
v. Turner Broad. Sys. Inc., 935 F.Supp. 490 , 494 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (‘photographic images of actual people, places and
events may be as creative and deserving of protection as purely fanciful creations”).

Accordingly, Cariou's Photos are worthy of copyright protection.
C. Fair Use

From the infancy of copyright protection, some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials has been thought
necessary to fulfill copyright's very purpose, “[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts....” Campbell v. Acuff—
Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ( quoting U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8). At the
Constitutional level, while the “Copyright Clause and the First Amendment [are] intuitively in conflict, [they] were drafted to
work together to prevent censorship” such that “the balance between the First Amendment and copyright is preserved, in
part, by the idea/expression dichotomy and the doctrine of fair use.” Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 268 F.3d 1257 ,
1263 (11th Cir.2001) ( citing Eldred v. Reno, 239 F.3d 372 , 375 (D.C.Cir.2001) ( quoting Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 560 ,
105 S.Ct. 2218 )).

“Copyright law thus must address the inevitable tension between the property rights it establishes in creative works,
which must be protected up to a point, and the ability of authors, artists, and the rest

[784 F.Supp.2d 347]

of us to express them- or ourselves by reference to the works of others, which must be protected up to a point. The fair-use
doctrine mediates between the two sets of interests, determining where each set of interests ceases to control.” Blanch v.
Koons. 467 F.3d 244 , 250 (2d Cir.2006); see also Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. v. RDR Books, 575 F.Supp.2d 513 , 540
(S.D.N.Y.2008) (“At stake in this case are the incentive to create original works which copyright protection fosters and the
freedom to produce secondary works which monopoly protection of copyright stifles—both interests benefit the public”)
(quoting Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1109) (1990) (hereinafter “Leval”) (noting that
although “the monopoly created by copyright ... rewards the individual author in order to benefit the public [,]” on the other
hand “the monopoly protection of intellectual property that impeded referential analysis and the development of new ideas
out of old would strangle the creative process.”)

The doctrine of Fair Use was codified in Section 107 of the 1976 Copyright Act. Section 107 calls for a four-factor test:
Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use:

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by
reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism,


--- Page 4 ---
comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an
infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be
considered shall include-

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. § 107.

In applying the fair use doctrine, “[t]he task is not to be simplified with bright-line rules, for the statute, like the doctrine
it recognizes, calls for case-by-case analysis.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577 —78, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . In conducting that analysis,
“all [of the four factors] are to be explored, and the results weighed together in light of the purposes of copyright.” /d.

D. Applying the Four-Factor Analysis 1. The Purpose and Character of Prince's Use of the Photos
i. Transformative Use

“The central purpose of the inquiry into the first factor is to determine, in Justice Story's words, whether the new work
merely supersede[s] the objects of the original creation or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different
character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message; it asks, in other words, whether and to what extent
the new work is ‘transformative.’ ” Salinger v. Colting, 641 F.Supp.2d 250 , 256 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (rev'd on other grounds 607
F.3d 68 (2d Cir.2010) ); Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Although a
transformative use is not strictly required for the Defendant to establish the defense of fair use, “the goal of copyright, to
promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works. Such works thus lie at the heart
of the fair

[784 F.Supp.2d 348]

use doctrine's guarantee of breathing space within the confines of copyright, and the more transformative the new work, the
less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.” Id. ( citing
Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 478-80, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (U.S.1984) )
(Blackmun, J., dissenting).

The inquiry into the first factor of the fair use test, “ ‘the purpose and character of the use,’ may be guided by the
examples given in the preamble to § 107, looking to whether the use is for criticism, or comment, or news reporting, and the
like.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578 —79, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 107) (identifying parody as a use akin to the
illustrative uses identified in the preamble).

As the Second Circuit clearly noted in Castle Rock, the fact that a work “recast[s], transform[s], or adapt[s] an original
work into a new mode of presentation,” thus making it a “derivative work” under 17 U.S.C. § 101, does not make the work
“transformative” in the sense of the first fair use factor. Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub. Group, Inc., 150 F.3d
132 , 143 (2d Cir.1998). Nevertheless, Defendants invite this Court to find that use of copyrighted materials as raw materials
in creating “appropriation art” which does not comment on the copyrighted original is a fair use akin to those identified in the
preamble to § 107.

The cases Defendants cite for the proposition that use of copyrighted materials as “raw ingredients” in the creation of
new works is per se fair use do not support their position, and the Court is aware of no precedent holding that such use is
fair absent transformative comment on the original. To the contrary, the illustrative fair uses listed in the preamble to § 107
—‘criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching [...], scholarship, [and] research’—all have at their core a focus on the
original works or their historical context, and all of the precedent this Court can identify imposes a requirement that the new
work in some way comment on, relate to the historical context of, or critically refer back to the original works. See, e.g.,
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (transformative use is use that “alter[s] the first with new expression, meaning,
or message”); Bourne v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 602 F.Supp.2d 499 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (Batts, J.) (parody song
which commented both on the copyrighted original and on famous person associated with original was transformative);
Blanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d at 252 -53 (use of copyrighted fashion advertisement as “raw material” was transformative
because artist used it to comment on the role such advertisements play in our culture and on the attitudes the original and
other advertisements like it promote); Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp.. 137 F.3d 109 , 114 (2d Cir.1998)
(superimposition of Leslie Nielsen's face on photo of body intended to resemble pregnant Demi Moore commented on
original photo of Moore by holding its pretentiousness up to ridicule). C.f. Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301 , 310 (2d Cir.1992),
cert. denied,_506 U.S. 934 , 113 S.Ct. 365 , 121 L.Ed.2d 278 (1992) (sculpture drawn from copyrighted photograph was not
fair use because while the sculpture was a “satirical critique of our materialistic society, it is difficult to discern any parody of
[or comment on] the photograph ... itself.”)



--- Page 5 ---
“If an infringement of copyrightable expression could be justified as fair use solely on the basis of the infringer's claim

to a higher or different artistic use ... there would be no practicable boundary to the fair use defense.” Rogers v. Koons, 960
F.2d at 310 . The Court therefore declines Defendants’ invitation to find that

[784 F.Supp.2d 349]

appropriation art is per se fair use, regardless of whether or not the new artwork in any way comments on the original works
appropriated. Accordingly, Prince's Paintings are transformative only to the extent that they comment on the Photos; to the
extent they merely recast, transform, or adapt the Photos, Prince's Paintings are instead infringing derivative works. See
Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 143 .

Prince testified that he has no interest in the original meaning of the photographs he uses. See e.g., RP Tr. at 338.
Prince testified that he doesn't “really have a message” he attempts to communicate when making art. RP Tr. at 45—46. In
creating the Paintings, Prince did not intend to comment on any aspects of the original works or on the broader culture. See
e.g., RP Tr. at 357-60; 362-64. Prince's intent in creating the Canal Zone paintings was to pay homage or tribute to other
painters, including Picasso, Cezanne, Warhol, and de Kooning, see RP Tr. at 164-67, 300-01, and to create beautiful
artworks which related to musical themes and to a post-apocalyptic screenplay he was writing which featured a reggae
band, see, e.g., RP Tr. 7, 30, 207-08, 218, 232, 251-52. Prince intended to emphasize themes of equality of the sexes;
highlight “the three relationships in the world, which are men and women, men and men, and women and women”; and
portray a contemporary take on the music scene. RP Tr. 338-39. With regard to the paintings in which Prince collaged
guitars onto portraits of Rastafarian men which were taken from Yes, Rasta, Prince testified that his message related to the
fact that the men had become guitar players. See, e.g., RP Tr. at 340 (“[H]e's playing the guitar now, it looks like he's playing
the guitar, it looks as if he's always played the guitar, that's what my message was.”); see a/so RP Tr. 166-68, 279.

Prince also testified that his purpose in appropriating other people's originals for use in his artwork is that doing so
helps him “get as much fact into [his] work and reduce[ ] the amount of speculation.” RP Tr. at 44. That is, he chooses the
photographs he appropriates for what he perceives to be their truth—suggesting that his purpose in using Cariou's
Rastafarian portraits was the same as Cariou's original purpose in taking them: a desire to communicate to the viewer core
truths about Rastafarians and their culture. See Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd.. 448 F.3d 605 , 609 (2d
Cir.2006) (considering, in weighing transformativeness, whether the new purpose in using an original work was “plainly
different from the original purpose for which it was created.”)

On the facts before the Court, it is apparent that Prince did not intend to comment on Cariou, on Cariou's Photos, or on
aspects of popular culture closely associated with Cariou or the Photos when he appropriated the Photos, and Price's own
testimony-shows that his intent was not transformative within the meaning of Section 107, though Prince intended his
overall work to be creative and new.

As this Court and others in this jurisdiction have found, where a work is not “consistently transformative,” and “lacks
restraint in using [Plaintiff's] original expression for its inherent ... aesthetic value,” the “transformative character of [that
work] is diminished.” Salinger v. Colting. 641 F.Supp.2d 250 , 262 ( rev'd on other grounds 607 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 2010) );
Warner Bros. Enter. Inc. v. RDR Books, 575 F.Supp.2d 513 , 544 (S.D.N.Y.2008) (citing Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling

Kindersley Ltd.. 448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir.2006) ). See Suntrust Bank, _268 F.3d at 1280 (Marcus, J., concurring) (finding that
issue of transformative character cuts “decisively in [Defendant's] favor” where the

[784 F.Supp.2d 350]
ratio of “the borrowed and the new elements’ is “very low, and the incongruity between them wide’).

Accordingly, while there may be some minimal transformative element intended in Prince's use of the Photos, the
overall transformativeness varies from work to work depending on the amount of copying. In the works most heavily drawn
from Cariou's Photos, such as those in which Prince uses entire photographs or unaltered portraits taken from Yes, Rasta,
there is vanishingly little, if any, transformative element; in those where Cariou's Photos play a comparatively minor role,
Defendant has a stronger argument that his work is transformative of Cariou's original Photos. 8 Overall, because the
transformative content of Prince's paintings is minimal at best, and because that element is not consistent throughout the 28
paintings in which Prince used the Photos, the “transformative use” prong of the first § 107 factor weighs heavily against a
finding of fair use.

ii. Commerciality

The second prong of the first factor of the § 107 test asks whether the otherwise infringing work “serves a commercial

purpose or nonprofit educational purpose.” Suntrust Bank, 268 F.3d at 1269 (citing § 107(1)). The less transformative a
work, the more importance should be attached to “the extent of its commerciality” in determining whether the first factor

favors a finding of fair use. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 580 -81, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (if “the commentary has no critical bearing on the
substance or style of the original composition ... the claim to fairness in borrowing from another's work diminishes
accordingly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like the extent of its commerciality loom larger.”); see American
Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913 , 922 (2d Cir.1995) (“The greater the private economic rewards reaped by
the secondary user (to the exclusion of broader public benefits), the more likely the first factor will favor the copyright holder



--- Page 6 ---
and the less likely the use will be considered fair.”) “[C]ourts are more willing to find a secondary use fair when it produces a
value that benefits the broader public interest.” Blanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d 244 , 253-54. “Notwithstanding the fact that artists
are sometimes paid and museums sometimes earn money, the public exhibition of art is widely ... considered to have value
that benefits the wider public interest.” /d. (citations and internal quotations omitted).

The Canal Zone show at the Gagosian Gallery was advertised in seven different newspapers, five of which included
reproductions of Cariou's Photos as altered by Prince. AM Tr. at 42-50; LG Tr. at 36. The Gagosian Defendants sent some
7,500 invitation cards, featuring a reproduction of a Prince work containing a Cariou Photo, to clients of the Gallery, LG Tr.
at 35, AM Tr. at 29-33, and sold the leftover invitations to a poster company, AM Tr. at 55-59. As a result of these and other
marketing efforts, Gagosian Gallery sold eight of the Canal Zone Paintings for a total of $10,480,000.00, 60% of which went
to Prince and 40% of which went to Gagosian Gallery. Brooks Dec. Ex. P § 2 and Ex. A; LG Tr. at 48. Seven other Canal

[784 F.Supp.2d 351]

Zone Paintings were exchanged for art with an estimated value between $6,000,000.00 and $8,000,000.00. Brooks Dec. Ex
P 43; LG Tr. at 136-37, 149-50. Gagosian Gallery sold $6,784.00 worth of Canal Zone exhibition catalogs. Brooks Dec. Ex.
P 4 4. The facts before the Court do not establish whether any of the Paintings have ever been made available for public

viewing other than when they were offered for sale at the Gallery.

This Court recognizes the inherent public interest and cultural value of public exhibition of art and of an overall increase
in public access to artwork. However, the facts before the Court show that Defendants’ use and exploitation of the Photos
was also substantially commercial, especially where the Gagosian Defendants are concerned. Accordingly, given the overall
low transformative content of Prince's Paintings, the commerciality prong of the first § 107 factor weighs against a finding of
fair use.

iii. Bad Faith

The first § 107 factor requires the Court to consider “the propriety of a defendant's conduct,” which is an integral part of
the Court's analysis of the character of the use. NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst., 364 F.3d 471 , 478 (2d Cir.2004) (citations
omitted). Though not in itself determinative, “it has been considered relevant within this subfactor that a defendant could
have acquired the copyrighted [material] legitimately.” /d.

Here, Prince testified that he does not have a different standard or weigh different considerations when appropriating
works with a disclosed author than he does when using materials that are in the public domain; to Prince, the question of
whether an image is appropriate for his use is “just a question of whether [he] like[s] the image.” RP Tr. at 100. Prince's
employee contacted the publisher of Yes, Rasta to purchase additional copies of the book, but apparently neither Prince nor
his employee ever asked the publisher about licensing or otherwise sought permission to use Yes, Rasta or the Photos
contained therein legitimately. RP Tr. 236-41, 183. Nor did Prince attempt to contact Cariou by email and inquire about
usage rights to the Photos, even though Yes, Rasta clearly identified Cariou as the sole copyright holder and even though
Cariou's publicly-accessible website includes an email address at which he may be reached. See PC Tr. 238-40, 254, 260.
Under these circumstances, Prince's bad faith is evident. Moreover, since the record establishes that the Gagosian
Defendants were aware that Prince is an habitual user of other artists' copyrighted work, without permission, and because
he record is equally clear that the Gagosian Defendants neither inquired into whether Prince had obtained permission to
use the Photos contained in the Canal Zone Paintings nor ceased their commercial exploitation of the Paintings after
receiving Cariou's cease-and-desist notice, the bad faith of the Gagosian Defendants is equally clear.

Because Prince's use was at most only minimally transformative of Cariou's Photos, because the use was substantially
hough not exclusively commercial, and because Prince and the Gagosian Defendants acted in bad faith, the first factor in
he fair use analysis weighs heavily in favor of Plaintiff.

2. The Nature of the Copyrighted Work
“The more the copyrighted matter is at the center of the protected concerns of the copyright law, the more the other

actors, including justification, must favor the secondary user in order to earn a fair use finding.” Leval at 1122. “The statutory
articulation of this factor derives from Justice Story's mention ... of the ‘value of the materials used.’ Justice

[784 F.Supp.2d 352]

Story's word choice is more communicative than our statute's ‘nature of,’ as it suggests that some protected matter is more
‘valued’ under copyright that others. This should not be seen as an invitation to judges to pass on [artistic] quality, but rather
to consider whether the protected [work] is of the creative or instructive type that the copyright laws value and seek to
foster.” /d. at 1117. A key distinction that has emerged “in the decisions evaluating the second factor [is] whether the work is
expressive or creative, such as a work of fiction, or more factual, with a greater leeway being allowed to a claim of fair use
where the work is factual or informational.” 2 Abrams, The Law of Copyright, § 15:52 (2006).

Here, the Court finds that Cariou's Photos are highly original and creative artistic works and that they constitute
“creative expression for public dissemination” and thus “fall [ ] within the core of the copyright's protective purposes.”
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Consequently, this factor weighs against a finding of fair use.



--- Page 7 ---
3. The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

The “amount and substantiality of the portion of the copyrighted work used [ ] must be examined in context [and] the
inquiry must focus on whether the extent of [the] copying is consistent with or more than necessary to further the purpose
and character of the use.” Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 144 ( quoting Campbell,510 U.S. at 586 —87, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ) (internal
quotations omitted). The Court must examine not only “the quantity of the materials used, but their quality and importance
too.” Warner Bros. Enter., Inc., 575 F.Supp.2d at 546 ( quoting Campbell.510 U.S. at 587 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

“[W]hatever the use, generally it may not constitute a fair use if the entire work is reproduced.” Weissmann v.
Freeman, 868 F.2d 1313 , 1325 (2d Cir.1989) (citing 3 Nimmer on Copyright § 13.05[A] at 13-80). Moreover, the amount
and substantiality factor weighs in favor of the copyright holder “where the portion used was essentially the heart of the
copyrighted work.” Wright v. Warner Books, Inc., 953 F.2d 731 , 738 (2d Cir.1991) (quoting Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 565 ,
105 S.Ct. 2218 ) (internal quotations omitted).

“As the statutory language indicates, a taking may not be excused merely because it is insubstantial with respect to the
infringing work.” Harper & Row v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. at 565 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original)
(quoting Judge Learned Hand, who “cogently remarked, ‘no plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his
work he did not pirate.’ ”)

In a number of his Paintings, Prince appropriated entire Photos, and in the majority of his Paintings, Prince
appropriated the central figures depicted in portraits taken by Cariou and published in Yes, Rasta. Those central figures are
of overwhelming quality and importance to Cariou's Photos, going to the very heart of his work. Accordingly, the amount of
Prince's taking was substantially greater than necessary, given the slight transformative value of his secondary use, and the
third factor weighs heavily against a finding of fair use.

4. The Effect of the Use Upon the Potential Market for or Value of the Copyrighted Work

The fourth fair use factor requires courts “to consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular
actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the
defendant would result in a substantially

[784 F.Supp.2d 353]

adverse impact on the potential market for the original.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotations
omitted). The inquiry “must take account not only of harm to the original but also of harm to the market for derivative works.”
Id. Harm to the market for derivatives weighs against a finding of fair use “because the licensing of derivatives is an
important economic incentive to the creation of originals.” /d. at 593, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . “Potential derivative uses include only
hose that creators of original works would in general develop or license others to develop.” Warner Bros. Enter., Inc., 575
F.Supp.2d at 549 ( quoting Campbell,_510 U.S. at 592 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also id. at
550-51 (finding that where Defendant's derivative work “is only marginally transformative, [it] is likely to supplant the market
or [Plaintiff's derivative work]”) ( citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

Defendants' protestations that Cariou has not marketed his Photos more aggressively (or, indeed, as aggressively as
Prince has marketed his Paintings) are unavailing. As the Second Circuit has previously emphasized, the “potential market”
or the copyrighted work and its derivatives must be examined, even if the “author has disavowed any intention to publish
hem during his lifetime,” given that an author “has the right to change his mind” and is “entitled to protect his opportunity to
sell his [works].” J.D. Salinger v. Random House, Inc., 811 F.2d 90 , 99 (2d Cir.1987) (emphasis omitted); see Castle Rock,
150 F.3d at 145 —46 (finding the fourth factor to favor Plaintiff even where Plaintiff “has evidenced little if any interest in
exploiting this market for derivative works” because copyright law must “respect that creative and economic choice”). The
act that Plaintiff has not marketed his work more aggressively is therefore irrelevant.

Here, it is undisputed that a gallery owner discontinued plans to show the Yes, Rasta Photos, and to offer them for sale
0 collectors, because she did not want to appear to be capitalizing on Prince's Paintings and did not want to show work
which had been “done already” at the nearby Gagosian Gallery. CC Tr. 89, 91, 105. It is therefore clear that the market for
Cariou's Photos was usurped by Defendants. Moreover, licensing original works for secondary use by other artists is the
kind of derivative use “that creators of original works would in general develop,” Warner Bros. Enter., Inc., 575 F.Supp.2d at
549 , and widespread unlicensed use in new artworks would destroy the market for such licensessee Campbell, 510 U.S.
at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Accordingly, the Court finds that Prince has unfairly damaged both the actual and potential markets
for Cariou's original work and the potential market for derivative use licenses for Cariou's original work.

Because Defendants' secondary use has unfairly damaged the original market for the Photos and, if widespread, would
likely destroy an identifiable derivative market for the Photos, the fourth § 107 factor weighs against a finding of fair use.

5. Aggregate Analysis

The Court has considered the four factors set forth in § 107, and found that none favors a finding of fair use. Moreover,
“the monopoly created by copyright” does not unduly “impede[ ] referential analysis [or] the development of new ideas out of


--- Page 8 ---
old” when copyright law is enforced under circumstances like those presented here. Leval at 1109. Accordingly, the
purposes of copyright are best served by extending protection to Cariou's Photos.

Having conducted a case-specific analysis of the four factors laid out in 17 U.S.C. § 107 in light of the purposes of
copyright,

[784 F.Supp.2d 354]
the Court finds that Defendants are not entitled to the defense of fair use.
E. Liability of the Gagosian Defendants

Copyright infringement has two elements: “(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of
the work which are original.” Feist_499 U.S. at 361 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 .

Here, it is uncontroverted that the Gagosian Defendants copied original constituent elements of Cariou's copyrighted
Photos when they published the Canal Zone exhibition catalog, created and distributed invitation cards featuring
reproductions of Cariou's Photos, and otherwise distributed reproductions of Cariou's work as appropriated by Prince.
Moreover, by exhibiting and selling Prince's unauthorized works, the Gagosian Defendants infringed Cariou's exclusive
rights, as copyright owner of the Photos, to reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, sell, and display the
Photographs. See Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 106(1), (2), (3), and (5). The Court therefore finds the Gagosian Defendants
directly liable for copyright infringement.

The Gagosian Defendants are also liable as vicarious and contributory infringers.

“The concept of vicarious copyright infringement was developed in the Second Circuit as an outgrowth of the agency
principles of respondiat superior.” Faulkner v. Nat'l Geo. Soc., 211 F.Supp.2d 450 , 472 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (citations omitted).
“Vicarious liability extends beyond an employer/employee relationship to cases in which a defendant has the right and ability
to supervise the infringing activity and also has a direct financial interest in such activities. Benefit and control are the
signposts of vicarious liability.” /d. (citations omitted).

Here, the record establishes that Gagosian was “handling everything” to do with the marketing of the Canal Zone
Paintings beginning at the time Price first showed Canal Zone (2007), which Prince thought of as a “preview” of the
characters he would use in the Canal Zone Paintings, in December, 2007. See, e.g., RP Tr. at 185-87 (describing
Gagosian's role in the Eden Rock show and describing Gagosian's home as an “off-off-off Broadway” location where
previously unseen paintings could be shown and sold). The Court therefore finds that the Gagosian Defendants had the
right and ability to supervise Price's work, or at the very least the right and ability (and perhaps even responsibility) to ensure
that Prince obtained licenses to use the Photos before they made Prince's Paintings available for sale. The financial benefit
of the infringing use to the Gagosian Defendants is self-evident. Accordingly, the Gagosian Defendants are liable as
vicarious infringers.

“One who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially contributes to the infringing conduct
of another, may be held liable as a contributory infringer.” Faulkner,211 F.Supp.2d at 473 (citations and quotations omitted)
In other words, “the standard for contributory infringement has two prongs, the ‘knowledge’ prong and the ‘material
contribution’ prong.” /d. “Knowledge of the infringing activity may be actual or constructive ... In other words, this prong is
satisfied if the defendant knew or should have known of the infringing activity at the time of its material contribution.” /d. at
474 (citations and quotations omitted). “Advertising or otherwise promoting an infringing product or service may be sufficient
to satisfy the material contribution prong.” /d. at 473-74.

Here, the Gagosian Defendants were well aware of (and capitalized on) Prince's reputation as an appropriation artist
who rejects the constricts of copyright

[784 F.Supp.2d 355]

law, but they never inquired into the propriety of Prince's use of the Photos. The Court concludes that the Gagosian
Defendants knew or should have known of the infringement at the time that they reproduced, advertised, marketed, and
otherwise promoted the Paintings. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Gagosian Defendants are liable as contributory
infringers.

Because Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of copyright infringement as against all Defendants, and because
the defense of fair use does not apply, Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment on the issue of liability is GRANTED in its
entirety.

F. Plaintiff's Claim for Conspiracy Under the Copyright Act

Defendants argue that Plaintiff's fifth claim for relief, which charges conspiracy to violate his rights under the Copyright
Act, must be dismissed as failing to state a claim on which relief may be granted.

No Party has called the Court's attention to any Second Circuit or Supreme Court authority which provides that a cause
of action for conspiracy to violate the Copyright Act may lie under New York or Federal law. Nor is conspiracy proscribed by


--- Page 9 ---
the Copyright Act itself. See generally Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 501 et seq. ; Calloway v. Marvel Entertainment Group, No.
82 Civ. 8697(RWS), 1983 WL 1152, at *5 (S.D.N.Y.1983).

In the absence of contrary authority, the Court finds Judge Sweet's reasoning in Irwin v. ZDF Enterprises GmbH, No.
04 CIV. 8027(RWS), 2006 WL 374960 (S.D.N.Y. February 16, 2006) persuasive. In /rwin, Judge Sweet considered whether
the Copyright Act foreclosed a common law conspiracy claim based on copyright infringement and determined that
“[b]ecause copyright law already recognizes the concepts of contributory infringement and vicarious copyright infringement
... which extend joint and several liability to those who participate in the copyright infringement ... [a] civil conspiracy claim
does not add substantively to the underlying federal copyright claim ...” /rwin at *4 (citations and quotations omitted).

The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff's Fifth Cause of Action must be dismissed.
Ill. CONCLUSION

For reasons stated herein, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on the issues of copyright
infringement, fair use, and liability. The Court DENIES Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment except as pertains to
Plaintiff's Fifth Cause of Action, for conspiracy, which is DISMISSED.

It is further ORDERED:

That, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 502, Defendants, their directors, officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys,
and all persons in active concert or participation with them, are hereby enjoined and restrained permanently from infringing
the copyright in the Photographs, or any other of Plaintiffs works, in any manner, and from reproducing, adapting,
displaying, publishing, advertising, promoting, selling, offering for sale, marketing, distributing, or otherwise disposing of the
Photographs or any copies of the Photographs, or any other of Plaintiff's works, and from participating or assisting in or
authorizing such conduct in any way.

That Defendants shall within ten days of the date of this Order deliver up for impounding, destruction, or other
disposition, as Plaintiff determines, all infringing copies of the Photographs, including the Paintings and unsold copies of the
Canal Zone exhibition book, in their possession, custody, or control and all transparencies, plates, masters, tapes, film
negatives,

[784 F.Supp.2d 356]
discs, and other articles for making such infringing copies.

That Defendants shall notify in writing any current or future owners of the Paintings of whom they are or become aware
that the Paintings infringe the copyright in the Photographs, that the Paintings were not lawfully made under the Copyright
Act of 1976, and that the Paintings cannot lawfully be displayed under 17 U.S.C. § 109(c).

That the Parties shall appear before this Court on May 6, 2011 at 11:00 am for a status conference regarding damages,
profits, and Plaintiff's costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:

4.Named Defendant Rizzoli International Publications, Inc. was voluntarily dismissed from this action by stipulation of
dismissal entered by the Court on February 5, 2010.

2.“PC. Tr.,” used herein, refers to the transcript of Patrick Cariou's deposition testimony. “RP Tr.,” “CC Tr.,” “LG Tr.”
and “AM Tr.” refer to the deposition transcripts of Richard Prince, Christiane Celle, Lawrence Gagosian, and Alison
McDonald, respectively. Similarly, “RP. Aff.” refers to the affidavit filed by Richard Prince.

3.The portraits and landscape photographs Cariou published in Yes, Rasta are collectively referred to herein as the
“Photos,” “Cariou's Photos,” or the “Yes, Rasta Photos.”

4.Gagosian testified that he “may have given’ “a small piece” of the Gallery to his sister. LG Tr. at 17.
&.The allegedly infringing works in the Canal Zone series, together with Canal Zone (2007), are referred to collectively
herein as the “Paintings,” “Prince's Paintings,” or the “Canal Zone Paintings.”

&1n reaching its determination herein, the Court has examined fully the exhibits and reproductions provided by the
Parties and has compared the 29 Canal Zone paintings with the Yes, Rasta Photos. The Court sees no need to describe
each work in great detail.

Defendant's arguments concerning whether ideas can be protected by copyright are irrelevant to this case: Plaintiff
seeks recourse for Prince's use of his original creative works, not for any use of or infringement on the ideas they portray.


--- Page 10 ---
8.Many of the Paintings which have the strongest claim to transformative use are also those in which the amount and
substantiality of the Photos used is least reasonable: those which feature, as their central elements, strikingly original
Rastafarian portraits taken from Yes, Rasta Photos. See discussion of third Section 107 factor, infra. For that reason, even
the most transformative Paintings have only a weak claim to fair use, since the four § 107 factors must be “weighed together
in light of the purposes of copyright.” Campbell,_510 U.S. at 577 —78, 114 S.Ct. 1164 .

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

Saris, DJ.
INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Leah Bassett rented her Martha's Vineyard home to Defendant Joshua Spafford for personal residential purposes.
Unbeknownst to Bassett, the property was then used as a set for pornographic videos and photographs, as well as housing
for cast and crewmembers.

In March 2018, Bassett filed this suit alleging ten counts: (I) breach of contract, (Il) trespass, (Ill) negligence, (IV) violations
of Chapter 93A, (V) civil conspiracy,

[459 F.Supp.3d 301]

(VI) civil fraud, (VII) infliction of emotional distress, (VIII) interference with advantageous business relations, (IX) copyright
infringement, and (X) civil RICO violations. An eleventh count of (XI) defamation was added in May 2018.

Three defendants — Monica Jensen, Jon Blitt and Mile High Distribution, LLC (collectively, ""Defendants"" +) — have moved
for summary judgment on all claims. Bassett cross-moved for summary judgment on four counts — Chapter 93A, civil
conspiracy, infliction of emotional distress, and copyright infringement.

After hearing, the Court ALLOWS IN PART (Counts |, Il, Ill, VI, X, XI) and DENIES IN PART (Counts IV, V, VII, and VIII)
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 86). The Court defers ruling on Count IX pending Plaintiff's
submission within 45 days of an analysis of all appearances of her copyrighted works in Defendants’ films. The Court also
DENIES Bassett's motion for partial summary judgment as to Counts IV, V, and VII (Docket No. 99) and defers ruling as to
Count IX.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. With respect to Defendants’ motion, the following facts are
presented in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, unless otherwise noted.

I. Lease Agreement

In October 2014, Leah Bassett signed an agreement with Joshua Spafford to lease her Martha's Vineyard residence from
October 4, 2014 until May 15, 2015. The lease was ""for use as a personal residence, excluding all other uses."" Dkt. 89-1 at
2. The lease also provided that the residence was to be ""used and occupied only by the members of the Tenant's family."" Id.
The lease prohibited Spafford from assigning or subletting the property without prior consent. Although Bassett would be out
of the country for the term of her lease, several members of her family lived on the same private road as her property and
periodically assisted Spafford with tasks like clearing snow from the driveway.

Il. Use of Bassett's Property

Spafford had come to Martha's Vineyard to work as a still photographer and camera man for Monica Jensen, an adult film
director with the professional pseudonym of Nica Noelle. Jensen was directing pornographic films for distribution by Mile
High Distribution, Inc. (""Mile High""), a Quebec-based adult film distribution company.


--- Page 2 ---
Spafford initially rented Bassett's house for his own residential purposes, believing that filming would take place at other
locations on the island. However, Jensen soon pressured him to use Bassett's residence as both a filming location and as
housing for cast and crew. Jensen promised to cover the property's rental costs and threatened to fire Spafford if he did not
agree.

According to Defendants, Bassett's home and household items appear in scenes from nine films that were distributed by
Mile High, as well as still inages accompanying five other films. Scenes showing Bassett's home also appear in two
compilation titles that were distributed by Mile High. Bassett asserts that she has found twenty-one films featuring scenes or
stills from her house. In addition, cast members took promotional photos at the property that they posted on their own social
media accounts.

The extent of Jon Blitt's role in Mile High during this period and his involvement
[459 F.Supp.3d 302]

with Jensen's projects is disputed. Blitt asserts he was helping to run Mile High on behalf of his father, who was ill, but was
not an employee and had no direct involvement in Jensen's activities on Martha's Vineyard. Bassett claims Blitt held a
managerial position at Mile High, where he developed and then directly oversaw two ""brands"" of pornographic films, titled
""Icon Male"" and ""Transsensual,"" which included the films directed by Jensen on Martha's Vineyard.

lll. Breaking of Lease

On March 15, 2015, over five months into the lease, Spafford sent Bassett an email that he had been ""let go from [his] job""
and would be ""completely unable to finish [his] payments on [the] lease from March to the end (May)."" Dkt. 89-2 at 2. He
wrote that the house was ""in good condition"" but that there were clothes, photography gear, and bags of garbage left
behind. Id. He also wrote that he had disabled all the carbon monoxide alarms when they went off in the middle of the night,
including one alarm in Bassett's locked master closet.

The next day, on March 16, 2015, Bassett's mother went to check on the property. She saw ""strangers, not authorized
guests, unpacking their luggage."" Dkt. 89-3 at 2. Bassett's mother then encountered Jensen, who said she was subletting
the property. Soon after, Jensen spoke with Bassett by phone and said she had paid Spafford for the February and March
rent. Jensen offered to take over the lease for the remaining months. At this time, Bassett did not know Jensen was an adult
film director or that her residence had been used as an adult film set. On March 20, 2015, Bassett's mother and stepmother
sent her photographs of the condition of the house, including some damage to the property.

Bassett responded to Spafford by email on March 22, 2015. She informed Spafford that he was in breach of the lease
agreement and owed ""a minimum of $7,933"" for unpaid rent and incidentals, as well as additional charges for damage to the
property, which had not yet been assessed. Dkt. 89-3 at 3-4. She told Spafford that his ""story about the alarm sounding,
even if true, isn't grounds for breaking and entering"" into the bedroom closet. Id. at 3. Bassett informed Spafford that she
would accept $4,000 to settle his debt but would pursue legal action if he refused her offer or did not respond within a week.

Bassett first learned pornographic movies had been filmed in her house on March 26, 2015. While in discussions with
Jensen about continuing the lease, Bassett received an email from an address she did not recognize. She searched the
name online and discovered Jensen's pseudonym, as well as her affiliation with Mile High. To her distress, Bassett saw her
own house in online promotional materials.

The next day, on March 27, 2020, Jensen emailed Bassett and offered to ""pay [Bassett] a sum of money ... in exchange for
a signed release."" Dkt. 98-3 at 8. Jensen still did not disclose that the house had been used to shoot pornographic films and
images, although Bassett now knew. Bassett refused the offer and told Jensen to vacate the premises.

IV. Post-Lease Events

In May 2015, Bassett returned home and ""spent weeks"" repairing the damage to her property. Dkt. 98-3 at 9. Bassett was
nonetheless able to rent her house during the summer season and ""did not lose any rental income"" in the summers of 2015,
2016, or 2017. Dkt. 89-4 at 8-9. She believes she lost income in the summer of 2018 because she ""had to cancel [her] rental

[459 F.Supp.3d 303]
website when [she] filed the lawsuit because of the bad publicity."" Id. at 9.

In the meantime, Bassett was ""experiencing anxiety, inability to sleep, [and] lack of concentration"" in the wake of these
events. Dkt. 89-27 at 4. She became ""paranoid"" and suffered from ""sadness and anxiety [that was] deep, dark and
seemingly endless."" Dkt. 98-3 at 8. In September 2015, she began to see a therapist. Her therapist, a licensed social
worker, diagnosed Bassett with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (""PTSD""), although the diagnosis later shifted to ""acute
distress disorder."" Dkt. 98-2 at 30, 35. In 2018 and 2019, Bassett was prescribed medications for anxiety and depression.

V. Bassett's Copyright Filings

On September 30, 2016, a year and a half after learning about the pornographic movies, Bassett filed three certificates of
registration with the United States Copyright Office under the category of ""Unpublished Collection."" The collections are (1)
""Bathroom 1 Drawing, et al.,"" which comprises twenty-one drawings, paintings, and photographs; (2) ""Handsewn and


--- Page 3 ---
Designed Slipcover 2, et al.,"" which comprises twenty-two works, including handsewn slipcovers and pillows, wall hangings,
and collages; and (3) ""Table 1 Hand-painted Top, et al.,"" which comprises ten works, including painted tabletops, a fireplace,
and items of pottery. Dkt. 89-18 to 89-23.

Bassett registered the copyrights because she ""knew that there was a possibility [she] would have to file a lawsuit."" Dkt. 89-4
at 38. She had never sought registration before because she ""never had to sue anybody for using [her] artwork."" Id. The
works were ""solely being used to add decorative touches to [Bassett's] personal home in a manner that [she] felt would be
warm and aesthetically pleasing."" Dkt. 89-17 at 5.

At one point, Bassett had a website at LeahBassett.com, as well as Facebook and Instagram pages, showing her artwork.
However, she took the pages down before filing the present suit because she was fearful of Jensen ""attacking [her] in some
way online."" Dkt. 89-4 at 63. She also had an Etsy page offering her work for sale, which she closed before filing suit.
Bassett never sought to promote or sell any of the works in her copyrights on these sites.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate when there is ""no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute exists where the evidence ""is such that a reasonable
jury could resolve the point in the favor of the non-moving party."" Rivera-Rivera v. Medina & Medina, Inc. _ 898 F.3d 77 , 87
(1st Cir. 2018) (quoting Cherkaoui v. City of Quincy , 877 F.3d 14, 23-24 (1st Cir. 2017) ). A material fact is one with the
""potential of changing a case's outcome."" Doe v. Trs. of Bos. Coll. _ 892 F.3d 67 , 79 (1st Cir. 2018).

""The court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in [its]
favor."" Carlson v. Univ. of New Eng. , 899 F.3d 36, 43 (1st Cir. 2018). When parties cross-move for summary judgment, the
court must evaluate each motion ""separately, drawing inferences against each movant in turn."" Lawless v. Steward Health
Care Sys., LLC , 894 F.3d 9, 21 (1st Cir. 2018) (quoting EEOC v. Steamship Clerks Union , 48 F.3d 594, 603 n.8 (1st Cir.
1995) ).

DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

|. Copyright Claims
Defendants argue the Court may grant summary judgment on Bassett's copyright
[459 F.Supp.3d 304]

claim on several independent bases, namely: (1) the registrations are invalid because the items were not ""unpublished""
collections or do not qualify for copyright protection; (2) the use of any validly copyrighted items is de minimis; (3) any use is
fair use; and (4) Bassett has stated no recoverable damages. Jon Blitt also seeks dismissal in his personal capacity.

A. Validity and Scope of Copyrights
""[A] certificate of copyright registration constitutes prima facie evidence of copyrightability and shifts the burden to the

defendant to demonstrate why the copyright is not valid."" Soc'y of Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Inc. v. Gregory , 689 F.3d
29 , 40 (1st Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).

Defendants first argue that Bassett's copyrighted works were previously published on her website and/or online store,
rendering their registration as ""unpublished collections"" invalid. See Gold Value Int'l Textile, Inc. v. Sanctuary Clothing, LLC ,
925 F.3d 1140 , 1145-46 (9th Cir. 2019) (affirming summary judgment based on invalidity of ""unpublished collection"" of
designs that had previously been sold).

While Bassett admits she had a website and an Etsy store, Defendants have put forth no evidence that any of the
copyrighted works appeared on those sites. Bassett flatly denies that she ever ""sought to sell, reproduce, license or
otherwise seek a profit from any of the 53 works that were included in [the] 3 [copyright] applications."" Dkt. 98-3 4 33.
Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment based on invalidity of Bassett's ""unpublished collections.""

Defendants next contend that the registrations are at least partially invalid because many of the copyrighted works either are
not original or serve only a utilitarian purpose. See Feist Publ'ns. Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. 340 , 347,111 S.Ct.
1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (""[C]opyright protection may extend only to those components of a work that are original to
the author.""); Yankee Candle Co. v. Bridgewater Candle Co. , 259 F.3d 25, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting copyright protection
does not extend to ""an essentially functional design choice"").

""Courts assessing the applicability of the Copyright Act's protections to allegedly unique works frequently note that the
‘originality’ bar is set quite low."" Gregory . 689 F.3d at 47 . Most of the works in Bassett's registrations are entitled to
copyright protection under this ""light burden."" Id. (citation omitted). The works titled as drawings, paintings, photographs, wall
hangings, collages, and pottery exceed the low originality bar. The designs on the tabletops also qualify to the extent the
color and placement of the stenciled designs are original to Bassett. See Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc. ,—
U.S. , 1387 S. Ct. 1002 1012, 197 L.Ed.2d 354 (2017) (""[A] feature of the design of a useful article is eligible for
copyright if, when identified and imagined apart from the useful article, it would qualify as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural
work either on its own or when fixed in some other tangible medium."")



--- Page 4 ---
While the functionalist elements of the fireplace are not copyrightable, the aesthetic design choices are. Defendants argue
he fireplace is not ""attributable"" to Bassett because her father testified that a former boyfriend designed it, not Bassett.
Bassett testified that she co-designed the fireplace and submitted sketches of its design. Whether the fireplace is
attributable to Basset is a disputed issue of fact appropriate for determination by a factfinder.

Finally, the slipcovers and pillows do not surpass the low originality bar. Those works were made from fabric not designed by
Bassett and their shapes were

459 F.Supp.3d 305]

chosen for the functional purpose of covering items of furniture also not designed by Bassett. Those works are not entitled
‘0 copyright protection and will not be considered in the Court's further analysis.

B. De Minimis Doctrine

Defendants next argue that any use of Bassett's validly copyrighted works is de minimis and therefore falls outside the
scope of the Copyright Act's protections. In the First Circuit, ""de minimis copying is best viewed not as a separate defense
to copyright infringement but rather as a statement regarding the strength of the plaintiff's proof of substantial similarity.""
Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. ASP. Consulting LLC , 560 F.3d 53, 59 (1st Cir. 2009).

In a seminal case, the Second Circuit explained that where, as here, copyrighted material is undisputedly featured in another
work, the question is ""whether the admitted copying occurred to an extent sufficient to constitute actionable copying, i.e. ,
infringement."" Ringgold v. Black Entm't Television, Inc. , 126 F.3d 70, 75 (2d Cir. 1997). A primary factor in cases ""involving
visual works"" is ""the observability of the copied work — the length of time the copied work is observable in the allegedly
infringing work and such factors as focus, lighting, camera angles, and prominence."" Id.

In Ringgold , a television show featured a poster of a copyrighted artwork, called ""Church Picnic,"" in the background of a
scene. The Second Circuit described the work's appearance:

In the scene, at least a portion of the poster is shown a total of nine times. In some of those instances, the poster
is at the center of the screen, although nothing in the dialogue, action, or camera work particularly calls the
viewer's attention to the poster. The nine sequences in which a portion of the poster is visible range in duration
from 1.86 to 4.16 seconds. The aggregate duration of all nine sequences is 26.75 seconds.

Id. at 73.

The court noted that, by regulation, even ""background"" uses of copyrighted materials require payment of a license fee. Id. at
77. (citing 7 C.F.R. § 253.8 (1996) ). It found that ""the principal four-to-five-second segment in which almost all of the poster
is clearly visible, albeit in less than perfect focus, reenforced [sic] by the briefer segments in which smaller portions are
visible, all totaling 26 to 27 seconds, are not de minimis copying."" Id. The court also noted that ""Church Picnic"" would be
""recognizable as a painting, and with sufficient observable detail for the average lay observer to discern African—Americans
in Ringgold's colorful, virtually two-dimensional style."" Id. (citation omitted). Ringgold did not create a bright-line rule requiring
thematic relevance, as Defendants have suggested.

Defendants cite a series of post-Ringgold cases that further defined the contours of the de minimis doctrine. See Sandoval
v. New Line Cinema Corp. , 147 F.3d 215, 216, 218 (2d Cir. 1998) (finding de minimis the appearance of copyrighted
photographs for a total of 35.6 seconds where, due to poor lighting, great distance, and lack of focus, the photographs were
""not displayed with sufficient detail for the average lay observer to identify even the subject matter of the photographs, much
less the style used in creating them""); Gottlieb Dev. LLC v. Paramount Pictures Corp. , 590 F. Supp. 2d 625, 630 (S.D.N.Y.
2008) (finding de minimis the appearance of copyrighted pinball machine design in the background of a three-and-a-half-
minute scene where it appeared ""for seconds at a time,"" ""always partially obscured,"" and no ""character ever refer[red] to it"");

[459 F.Supp.3d 306]

Gayle v. Home Box Office, Inc. , 17-CV-5867 (JMF), 2018 WL 2059657, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 1, 2018) (finding de minimis
the two-to-three-second use of plaintiff's graffiti in a television show where it was ""at best, shown in the background at an
oblique angle and in low, uneven light"" such that it was ""next to impossible to notice when viewing the episode in real time"").

On the current record, the Court is unable to determine whether Defendants’ use of Bassett's copyrighted work is de
minimis. At hearing, Plaintiff's counsel proposed several sources to determine which works appeared in Defendants’ films
and to what extent, but none is sufficient for the Court to determine whether Bassett can meet her burden of proof.

The first is an affidavit by Stephanie Lahar analyzing the appearance of Bassett's works in a representative film, ""My TS
Student."" Dkt. 98-4. However, the affidavit uses a numbering system to identify each copyrighted work without a
corresponding key. It is impossible for the Court to determine whether the works that were featured are ones that pass the
originality bar. Furthermore, the Court cannot determine the detail in which the works are visible, a key component of the
Ringgold analysis.

Second, Bassett offers as exhibits screenshots from Defendants’ films. Dkt. Nos. 98-6, 98-8, 98-10, 98-11, 98-12, 98-13, 98-
14. In those screenshots, her works are ""recognizable as"" decorative art and ""with sufficient observable detail"" to see the
content and style of the work. See Ringgold , 126 F.3d at 77 . However, the Court is unable to determine the length of time



--- Page 5 ---
the works appear in that manner.

Another attached exhibit lists the works that appear in each scene of various films. It too is insufficient because it does not
track how long or the detail in which each work appears. Dkt. 98-3 at 18-25.

Finally, Bassett points to her own affidavit filed with her earlier motion for a preliminary injunction. Dkt. 62-1. Although that
affidavit provides the aggregate length of time that her works are visible in a number of films, it fails to identify the specific
works and in what level of detail they appear.

Thus, each source in the current record lacks critical information that the Court would need to undertake a de minimis
analysis under Ringgold . The Court requires a document describing which of Bassett's copyrighted works appear in which
films, for how long, and in what level of detail. This analysis should include representative screenshots. Because the de
minimis doctrine relates to an element of plaintiff's claim, Situation Mgmt. Sys. . 560 F.3d at 59 , Bassett bears the burden of
proof and must provide this analysis to the Court within 45 days if she intends to pursue her copyright claim.

C. Fair Use

Defendants next assert the affirmative defense of fair use, on which they bear the burden of proof. See Gregory , 689 F.3d at
59 . A court analyzing fair use considers four non-exhaustive statutory factors:

1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

2. The nature of the copyrighted work;
3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. § 107. The Court addresses each factor in turn.

[459 F.Supp.3d 307]

i. Purpose and Character of Use

The primary inquiry as to the purpose and character of an infringing use is ""whether and to what extent the new work is
‘transformative.’ "" Gregory , 689 F.3d at 59 (citation omitted). A work is transformative if it ""adds something new, with a
further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message."" Id. (quoting Campbell v.
Acuff—Rose Music. Inc. _ 510 U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ).

Defendants do not argue that their use was transformative, but rather stake their fair use claim on the ""incidental"" nature of
their use. The Ringgold court explicitly rejected an ""incidental use"" argument, writing that it ""could be said of virtually all set
decorations, thereby expanding fair use to permit wholesale appropriation of copyrighted art for movies and television."" 126
F.3d at 80 . Instead, the Second Circuit found that defendants’ use of ""Church Picnic"" was not transformative where it was
used for ""decorative effect ... precisely as a poster purchaser would use it to decorate a home."" Id. at 79. Similarly, here,
Bassett's works were featured in Mile High films as decorative elements, precisely how Bassett used them in her home.
Furthermore, the use here was ""of a commercial nature,"" which weighs against fair use in the first factor. See 17 U.S.C. §
107.

The first factor of purpose and character weighs in Bassett's favor.

ii. Nature of Copyrighted Work

The nature of the copyrighted work has two aspects: ""first, the extent to which it is a creative work enjoying broader
copyright protection as opposed to a factual work requiring broader dissemination and second, whether it is unpublished, in
which case the right of first publication is implicated."" Nufiez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp. , 235 F.3d 18 , 23 (1st Cir. 2000)
(citations omitted).

The first aspect weighs in Bassett's favor — her copyrighted works are artistic rather than factual. The second aspect
weighs somewhat in Bassett's favor. Bassett's copyrights are for ""unpublished collections,"" but she never intended to sell her
works, so Defendants did not usurp her opportunity to publish. See NUfez , 235 F.3d at 24 (noting this factor weighs less
where copyrighted works are not ""confidential or secret""). On the whole, the second factor weighs in Bassett's favor.

iii. Amount and Substantiality of Work Used

The ""amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole"" is a ""pliable"" factor, not a
""cold calculation[ ] of the percentage of a work used versus unused."" Gregory . 689 F.3d at 62 ; see also Fitzgerald v. CBS

Broad., Inc. . 491 F. Supp. 2d 177, 188 (D. Mass. 2007) (""This factor weighs less when considering a photograph — where
all or most of the work often must be used in order to preserve any meaning at all — than a work such as a text or musical

composition, where bits and pieces can be excerpted without losing all value."")



--- Page 6 ---
Here, some of Bassett's copyrighted works appear in full in screenshots from Defendants’ films. This factor weighs in
Bassett's favor.

iv. Effect on Potential Marked or Value of Work

Where no market exists for a copyrighted work because the copyright holder ""[nJever tried to sell"" it, the fourth factor favors
air use. See NUfiez , 235 F.3d at 25 . Market effect is ""the single most important element of fair use.""Gregory , 689 F.3d at
64 (quoting

459 F.Supp.3d 308]

Harper & Row Publishers. Inc. v. Nation Enters. . 471 U.S. 539, 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) ).

The fourth factor favors Defendants. By her own testimony, Bassett never intended to sell her copyrighted works.
v. Fair Use Conclusion

Three factors weigh in favor of Bassett and one factor — albeit the ""most important"" one, Gregory . 689 F.3d at 64 — weighs
for Defendants. Balancing the factors, Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on fair use.

D. Damages
Defendants also argue that, even assuming Bassett can show infringement, she has stated no recoverable damages.

Under the Copyright Act, a plaintiff who proves infringement may recover one of either (1) compensable damages pursuant
to 17 U.S.C. § 504(b) or (2) statutory damages pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c). Bassett is not entitled to ""statutory damages""
under 17 U.S.C. § 504(c) because she did not register her copyrights prior to the infringement. See 17 U.S.C. § 412 (""[NJo
award of statutory damages ... shall be made for ... any infringement of copyright in an unpublished work commenced before
the effective date of its registration"").

She may, however, be entitled to certain forms of compensable damages. Compensable damages under 17 U.S.C. § 504(b)
include ""(1) actual damages, which consist of all income and profits lost as a consequence of the infringement; and (2) any
nonduplicative profits earned by the defendant as a consequence of the copyright infringement."" Bruce v. Weekly World
News, Inc. , 310 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 2002).

One form of actual damages recoverable by a copyright holder is a ""reasonable fair market licensing fee[.]"" Id. In her
summary judgment briefing, Bassett seeks a reasonable licensing fee. Because all damages discovery was stayed in this
case, Bassett has not had the opportunity to develop the factual record regarding what fee, if any, Defendants would have
paid to license her copyrighted materials. If the Court determines that Defendants’ use of Bassett's copyrighted work was
greater than de minimis, it will authorize further discovery on this issue.

Bassett also seeks ""profits ... attributable to the infringement,"" which are recoverable as compensable damages under 17
U.S.C. § 504(b) to the extent they are not duplicative of actual damages. See Bruce . 310 F.3d at 28 . The Court declines to
address this form of damages until it can discern which films, if any, feature Bassett's work in a capacity that is greater than
de minimis.

E. Jon Blitt's Individual Liability

Jon Blitt argues he cannot be held liable for copyright infringement in his personal capacity. The Copyright Act permits
vicarious liability of a corporate officer where, among other cases, ""the officer was the dominant influence in the corporation,
and determined the policies which resulted in the infringement."" Marvin Music Co. v. BHC Ltd. P'ship . 830 F. Supp. 651,
654-55 (D. Mass. 1993).

Blitt's role in Mile High Productions is a disputed issue of fact. Blitt admits that he was helping to run Mile High during the
events in question while his father was ill. Bassett asserts that Blitt developed the ""Icon Male"" and ""Transsensual"" brands,
which featured the films made at Bassett's house. Joshua Spafford told Blitt they were improperly shooting out of Bassett's
home. Spafford also said Blitt ""let[ ] [Jensen's] behaviour [ ] slide because she is a ‘golden cow’ "" who brought in high profits
for Mile High. Dkt. 98-2 at 27.

[459 F.Supp.3d 309]

The reasonable inference in Bassett's favor is that Blitt ""determined the policies [at Mile High] which resulted in the
infringement"" during the relevant period.

Il. Infliction of Emotional Distress

Massachusetts law recognizes both intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. To prevail on a claim of
intentional infliction of emotional distress (""IIED""), a plaintiff must prove:

(1) the defendant either intended to inflict emotional distress or knew or should have known that emotional
distress was the likely result of [defendant's] conduct; (2) that the conduct was ""extreme and outrageous"" and
beyond all possible bounds of decency and was ""utterly intolerable in a civilized community""; (3) that the


--- Page 7 ---
defendant's actions caused the plaintiff's emotional distress and (4) that the plaintiff sustained severe emotional
distress.

McGrath v. Town of Sandwich , 22 F. Supp. 3d 58, 70 (D. Mass. 2014) (citation omitted).

Defendants first contend that their conduct was not ""extreme and outrageous."" ""[T]here is an issue for the jury if reasonable
people could differ on whether the conduct is ‘extreme and outrageous.’ "" Vittands v. Sudduth , 49 Mass.App.Ct. 401 , 730
N.E.2d 325 , 335 (2000) (citation omitted). A reasonable juror could find renting a residential home and then filming
commercial pornographic films over many months while housing cast and crew members, all without the homeowner's
consent, to be ""beyond all possible bounds of decency."" McGrath , 22 F. Supp. 3d at 70.2

Defendants next argue that even if their conduct was extreme and outrageous, it did not cause Bassett's distress because
Bassett admitted that the stress of bringing this lawsuit was ""definitely a big part of [her] emotional distress."" Dkt. 89-4 at 44.
Although Bassett cannot recover for emotional distress caused by this lawsuit, record evidence supports Bassett's position
that Defendants’ conduct directly caused her severe emotional distress. Bassett sought mental health counseling in
September 2015, long before she filed this suit.

The element of intent presents the hardest inquiry. Defendants’ intent was that Bassett never learn of their use of her
residence as a pornographic film set. Nonetheless, a factfinder could reasonably conclude that Defendants recklessly
disregarded that they were likely to cause Bassett emotional distress. See Nancy P. v. D'Amato , 401 Mass. 516 , 517
N.E.2d 824 , 827 (1988) (noting in relation to an IIED claim by the mother and brother of a child whom the defendant
sexually abused that although ""[i]t was [Defendant's] hope that they would never learn of his misconductf,] ... it would be a
question for the trier of fact whether [Defendant] acted recklessly, indifferent to the likely effect of his conduct on family
members who would be apt in time to learn of his outrageous conduct""). Here, there is evidence in the record that
Defendants knew that Bassett's family lived on the same private road as her property, were warned that the local press
might be aware of their activities, and caused damage to Bassett's property. A reasonable factfinder could conclude that
Defendants should have known Bassett was ""apt in time to learn of [their] outrageous conduct."" See id.

[459 F.Supp.3d 310]
The elements of a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress (""NIED"") are:

(1) negligence; (2) emotional distress; (3) causation; (4) physical harm manifested by objective symptomatology;
and (5) that a reasonable person would have suffered emotional distress under the circumstances of the case.

Opalenik v. LaBrie _ 945 F. Supp. 2d 168, 196 (D. Mass. 2013) (quotingSullivan v. Bos. Gas Co. , 414 Mass. 129 , 605
N.E.2d 805 , 807 (1993) ).

As to NIED, Defendants contest only the element of ""physical harm manifested by objective symptomatology."" Under
Massachusetts law, for a plaintiff to survive summary judgment on the physical harm requirement, she ""must corroborate
[her] mental distress claims with enough objective evidence of harm to convince a judge that [her] claims present a sufficient
likelihood of genuineness to go to trial."" Sullivan . 605 N.E.2d. at 810 . The testimony from Bassett's therapist that Bassett
frequently felt ill and was unable to sleep as a result of these events — leading to diagnoses of anxiety and acute distress
disorder — meets that threshold. See id. (favorably citing case where ""headaches, insomnia, loss of appetite and muscle
tension for several months"" was sufficient).

lll. Interference with Contractual Relations

Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff claiming tortious interference with contractual relations must establish that (1) she ""had
a contract with a third party,"" (2) ""which the defendant knowingly induced the third party to break,"" (3) the interference ""was

improper in motive or means,"" and (4) the interference caused the plaintiff harm.Sindi v. El-Moslimany , 896 F.3d 1, 23 (1st
Cir. 2018) (quoting Abramian v. Pres. & Fellows of Harvard Coll. , 432 Mass. 107 , 731 N.E.2d 1075 , 1088 (2000) ).

A reasonable factfinder could conclude that Defendants induced Spafford to break his contract with Bassett when Jensen,
as an agent of Mile High and Blitt, persuaded or coerced Spafford to allow commercial filming on the property, to house cast
and crew members, and to sublet the residence to Jensen, all in knowing violation of the lease agreement. Jensen
employed ""improper means"" when she threatened to fire Spafford if he did not breach the lease agreement. See United
Truck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman , 406 Mass. 811 , 551 N.E.2d 20 , 24 (1990) (listing ""us[ing] threats"" as an example of
""improper means""). Finally, Defendants’ interference caused Bassett harm because Bassett terminated the lease two
months early in response to Spafford's breaches, losing rental income.

Bassett also alleges that Defendants interfered with prospective leases because Bassett has declined to seek winter rentals
since Defendants’ actions. A plaintiff claiming tortious interference with prospective economic advantages must produce
""competent evidence of a specific business relationship, the consummation of which was reasonably likely."" Sindi , 896 F.3d
at 25 . Here, Bassett concedes that no identifiable prospective lessee has refused to rent her property because of
Defendants’ conduct. Bassett's decision not to seek renters during winter months does not involve a ""specific business
relationship"" with which Defendants interfered. See id. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this portion of
Bassett's claim.

Only Defendants’ interference with Bassett and Spafford's lease agreement survives their motion for summary judgment.


--- Page 8 ---
[459 F.Supp.3d 311]

IV. Chapter 93A

Chapter 93A provides a private cause of action to two categories of plaintiffs. Section 9, on which Bassett relies in her
complaint, provides a private cause of action to ""Any person, other than a person entitled to bring action under section
eleven of this chapter, who has been injured by another person's use or employment of [unfair or deceptive acts or practices
in the conduct of any trade or commerce]."" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A §§ 2, 9.

Section 11 provides relief for ""[a]ny person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce"" and suffers a loss of
money or property as a result of the use of unfair deceptive acts or practices ""by another person who engages in any trade
or commerce."" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A § 11. ""By their terms ... the two sections of chapter 93A that create private rights of
action are mutually exclusive."" Cont'l Ins. Co. v. Bahnan , 216 F.3d 150, 156 (1st Cir. 2000).

Defendants argue Bassett cannot invoke § 9 because, in the only commercial transaction to which she was a party in this
case, she acted as a landlord and so was ""engage[d] in the conduct of [ ] trade or commerce."" See id. (""[S]ection 9 affords no
relief to persons engaged in trade or commerce"").

However, certain landlord-tenant relationships are ""of a private nature, and in no way concern[ ] a trade or business"" for
purposes of Chapter 93A. Billings v. Wilson , 397 Mass. 614 , 493 N.E.2d 187 , 188 (1986). Significantly, courts have held
that in certain circumstances, renting a unit in an owner-occupied residence is of a private nature. Compare id. (finding 93A
did not apply to landlord-tenant dispute ""concerning the rental of a dwelling unit in an owner-occupied two-family house,
where the landlord owns no other rental real property"" and ""his motivation — that of mitigating the economic burden of
supporting his home — is of a personal rather than a business nature"") and Young v. Patukonis , 24 Mass.App.Ct. 907 , 506
N.E.2d 1164 , 1168 (1987) (finding ""owner-occupant of a three-family building, whose primary objective is personal"" was not
subject to suit as someone engaged in trade or commerce under 93A), with Bahnan , 216 F.3d at 156 (holding landlord could
not bring suit under § 9 where he ""rented out the subject property, [but] himself lived elsewhere, ... he applied for and
received a business owner's policy, and in the process completed a commercial insurance application in which he described
his business as ‘apartments’ "").

Bassett never owned any real estate besides the Martha's Vineyard home at issue and typically lived there when it was not
rented. The rentals were driven by ""financial necessity due to [her] still outstanding ‘construction’ mortgage, and the high real
estate taxes [and] property insurance"" on Martha's Vineyard. Dkt 112-3 at 4. There is no evidence that Bassett rented the
home in a business context. The short-term rental of her own home was a private transaction not ""undertaken in the ordinary
course of a trade or business."" Billings . 493 N.E.2d at 188 . Provided Bassett can meet the other requirements of Chapter
93A, like causation, she may proceed under § 9 as a ""person ... who has been injured"" by Defendant's commercial practices.
See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A § 9 ; Aspinall v. Philip Morris Co., Inc. , 442 Mass. 381 , 813 N.E.2d 476 , 491 (2004) (""
[C]ausation is a required element of a successful [Chapter] 93A claim."")

The alleged practice of shooting commercial pornographic films in a leased home without the owner's consent and in
violation of the lease falls within Chapter 93A's broad definition of an ""unfair or deceptive practice."" See Walsh v. TelTech

Sys., Inc. , 821 F.3d 155, 160 (1st Cir. 2016)
[459 F.Supp.3d 312]

(""Under Chapter 93A, an act or practice is unfair if it falls within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or
other established concept of unfairness; is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; and causes substantial injury to
consumers"" (cleaned up)); Aspinall 813 N.E.2d at 486 (""A practice is deceptive, for purposes of [Chapter] 93A, if it could
reasonably be found to have caused a person to act differently from the way he or she otherwise would have acted""
(cleaned up)).

V. Civil Conspiracy

In Massachusetts, a civil conspiracy requires (1) ""a common design or an agreement ... between two or more persons to do
a wrongful act"" and (2) ""proof of some tortious act in furtherance of the agreement."" Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. v. P & B Autobody
43 F.3d 1546 , 1564 (1st Cir. 1994). To establish civil conspiracy, a plaintiff must provide ""evidence that the defendants
agreed together"" to commit an underlying tort. Gutierrez v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth. , 437 Mass. 396 , 772 N.E.2d 552 , 568
(2002). 3

Viewing the evidence in Bassett's favor, Jensen — as an agent of Blitt and Mile High — and Spafford agreed to break the
lease agreement and to shoot commercial pornographic videos in Bassett's home without her consent, giving rise to viable
tort claims for interference with contractual relations and infliction of emotional distress.

VI. Breach of Contract

""To prevail on a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) there was an agreement between the
parties; (2) the agreement was supported by consideration; (3) the plaintiff was ready, willing, and able to perform his or her
part of the contract; (4) the defendant committed a breach of the contract; and (5) the plaintiff suffered harm as a result.""
Bulwer v. Mount Auburn Hosp. , 473 Mass. 672 , 46 N.E.3d 24 , 39 (2016) (numbering added).

The first and most basic element is at issue here. Defendants argue that Bassett's breach of contract claim must fail


--- Page 9 ---
because they were not parties to her lease agreement with Spafford, nor was Spafford acting as Defendants’ agent when he
signed the lease. The record is undisputed on both counts. Although Defendants may be liable for interfering with the
contract between Spafford and Bassett, as discussed above, they cannot be held directly liable for its breach.

Vil. Trespass

The elements of trespass under Massachusetts law are ""1) plaintiff's actual possession of the property at issue and 2) an
intentional and illegal entry by defendant."" Fed. Ins. Co. v. Bos. Water & Sewer Comm'n , 583 F. Supp. 2d 225 , 229 (D.
Mass. 2008). Defendants argue Bassett's trespass claim is barred by the statute of limitations, which is three years ""after the
cause of action accrues."" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A ; Doherty v. Admiral's Flagship Condo. Tr. , 80 Mass.App.Ct. 104,
951 N.E.2d 936 , 940 (2011). Under the Massachusetts ""discovery rule,"" a cause of action accrues ""when an event or
events have occurred that were reasonably likely to put the plaintiff on notice that someone may have caused her injury.""
Bowen v. Eli Lilly Co. . 408 Mass. 204 , 557 N.E.2d 739 , 741 (1990).

Bassett's trespass claim is based on the allegation that Spafford or another Mile
459 F.Supp.3d 313]

High-affiliated party broke into her master bedroom closet in order to disable the carbon monoxide detector within. The
locked closet was excluded from a tenant's authorized use in the lease agreement between Spafford and Bassett. Dkt. 89-1
at 7. (""The Landlord reserves the right to the exclusive use of locked storage areas in the closets, basement and attic for
storage of her personal property."")

Bassett knew that someone had forcibly opened the closet to disable the alarm on March 15, 2015, when Spafford informed
her by email that he had done so. In her return email on March 22, Bassett referred to this as ""breaking and entering."" While
Bassett later learned that the trespass occurred in the midst of filming, the cause of action accrued when she learned there
had been an ""intentional and illegal entry,"" not when she learned why. See Federal Insurance , 583 F. Supp. 2d at 229 .

Because the cause of action accrued more than three years before Bassett filed suit on March 26, 2018, it is barred by the
statute of limitations. 4

VII. Negligence

Bassett's common law negligence claim is also subject to a three-year statute of limitations. Doherty . 951 N.E.2d at 940 . To
all within the statute of limitations, it must have accrued no earlier than March 26, 2015.

Bassett's negligence claim is based on physical damage caused by ""the negligent actions of one or more of the persons
present on her premises while in the employ of the Mile High-associated Defendants."" Dkt. 1 951. The record reflects that
Bassett was aware of physical damage to her home at the latest on March 20, 2015, when her mother and stepmother sent
her photos documenting damage. Bassett confirmed that she was aware of damage to her home in her March 22, 2015
email to Spafford.

Bassett contends that her negligence claim nonetheless had not accrued because, at that time, she still did not know the full
extent of the damage or how it had been caused. ""The plaintiff need not know the full extent of the injury before the statute
of limitations] starts to run."" Bowen , 557 N.E.2d at 741 . As of March 20, 2015, Bassett was ""on notice that someone may
have caused her injury"" so her negligence claim is barred by the statute of limitations. See id.

IX. Civil Fraud

To prove fraud in Massachusetts, a plaintiff must show ""that the defendant made a false representation of a material fact
with knowledge of its falsity for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to act thereon, and that the plaintiff relied upon the
representation as true and acted upon it to his damage."" Barrett Assocs.., Inc. v. Aronson , 346 Mass. 150 , 190 N.E.2d 867 ,
868 (1963) (citation omitted). Bassett argues she detrimentally relied on Spafford's false representations that her home
would be used only as a residence and that because the films shot in her home are owned by Mile High, Defendants are
liable.

It is undisputed that when Spafford first signed the lease, he intended to use it only as a residence, exactly as he
represented to Bassett. Spafford made no misrepresentations to Bassett when she agreed to enter into the lease
agreement. Although Jensen arguably misrepresented

[459 F.Supp.3d 314]

her intentions in seeking to take over the lease from Spafford in March 2015, Bassett declined to extend the lease to Jensen
and so did not rely on that misrepresentation to her detriment. Even viewing all the facts in Bassett's favor, Defendants’
actions do not meet the elements of fraud under Massachusetts law.

X. Civil RICO

To prevail on a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must prove four elements: ""(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity."" Giuliano v. Fulton , 399 F.3d 381 , 386 (1st Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). The ""predicate acts"" for
racketeering activity are determined by reference to the exhaustive list at 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Beck v. Prupis , 529 U.S. 494



--- Page 10 ---
, 497 n.2, 120 S.Ct. 1608 , 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000) . Here, Bassett alleges predicate acts of ""dealing in obscene matter,""
""mail fraud [or] wire fraud,"" ""retaliating against a witness, victim, or informant,"" and/or ""criminal infringement of a copyright.""
Dkt. 98 at 24-25.

Bassett is unable to establish the last three of these four predicate acts. Bassett provides no factual basis for the predicate
act of ""mail fraud [or] wire fraud."" Bassett also provides no factual basis for the predicate act of ""retaliating against a witness,
victim, or informant."" The predicate act of retaliation requires that someone ""kill,"" ""caus[e] bodily injury,"" or ""damage[ ] the
tangible property"" of the witness or attempt to do one of those acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1513. None of that occurred here.

As to ""criminal infringement of a copyright,"" that predicate act requires ""willful infringement,"" meaning a defendant
specifically intended to violate someone's copyright, rather than simply knew that he was making copies. See United States
v. Liu , 731 F.3d 982 , 989-90 (9th Cir. 2013). In including this predicate act, ""Congress did not intend to ... subject all
multiple acts of intentional infringement to RICO liability"" and instead intended to target ""counterfeiting and piracy
organizations."" CoStar Realty Info., Inc. v. Field , 612 F. Supp. 2d 660, 676 (D. Md. 2009) (citation omitted). Defendants’
conduct, even if it proves to constitute civil copyright infringement, does not rise to the level of criminal infringement.

Finally, Bassett asserts that Defendants have committed predicate acts of ""dealing in obscene matter,"" which is a predicate
offense if it is ""chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,"" 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(A),
or would be indictable under federal criminal statutes prohibiting the mailing, import, or production for sale of ""obscene, lewd,
lascivious, or filthy ... film[s],"" 18 U.S.C. §§ 1461 - 65. On its face, one or more of the federal statutes may apply to
Defendants’ business, which distributes adult pornographic films for sale, including through the mail. Based on the Court's
review, these statutes are now rarely used to prosecute cases involving adult pornography, but they are not dead letter. See
Alexander v. United States , 509 U.S. 544 , 113 S.Ct. 2766 , 125 L.Ed.2d 441 (1993) (considering forfeiture challenges
related to prosecution of ""adult entertainment"" business in Minnesota where obscenity statutes were prosecuted
independently and served as predicate for criminal RICO); Fort Wayne Books. Inc. v. Indiana , 489 U.S. 46 , 109 S.Ct. 916 ,
103 L.Ed.2d 34 (1989) (upholding constitutionality of prosecution of adult bookstores under state criminal RICO statute).

Bassett's claim nonetheless fails because the type of injury she suffered from Defendants’ predicate acts was limited in
scope and time. In order to constitute a ""pattern"" of racketeering, predicate acts must amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. See

[459 F.Supp.3d 315]

H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co. . 492 U.S. 229 , 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893 , 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) . Continuity can be open- or
closed-ended. Id. at 237, 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893 . For ""open-ended"" continuity, a RICO plaintiff must show ""a realistic prospect
of continuity over an open-ended period yet to come."" Feinstein v. Resolution Tr. Corp. , 942 F.2d 34, 45 (1st Cir. 1991). For
""closed-ended"" continuity, a plaintiff must show ""a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.""
Giuliano v. Fulton , 399 F.3d 381 , 387 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting H.J. Inc. , 492 U.S. at 239 , 109 S.Ct. 2893 ). The First Circuit
has ""consistently declined to find continuity where the RICO claim concerns a single, narrow scheme targeting few victims.""
Id. at 390.

In addition, a civil RICO plaintiff must have been ""injured ... by reason of"" the predicate RICO acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Pursuant to this section, a civil RICO plaintiff must show both but-for and proximate causation. Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply
Corp. , 547 U.S. 451 , 457,126 S.Ct. 1991 , 164 L.Ed.2d 720 (2006) . ""When a court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate
causation, the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's injuries."" Id. at 461,
126 S.Ct. 1991 .

Bassett was arguably directly injured by Defendants’ predicate act of sending obscene films through the mail because it
compounded the reach of Defendants’ alleged civil copyright infringement. But the injuries Bassett has standing to pursue
were the result of a ""single, narrow scheme"" targeting only one victim within a closed timeframe. See Giuliano . 399 F.3d at
390.

Defendants unequivocally assert they have removed from distribution all films and photographs within their control that were
shot at Bassett's house. Although Bassett previously contended that she continued to find infringing videos and images
online, she does not maintain this claim in the affidavits she submitted to the summary judgment record. And even if other
individuals continue to distribute Defendants’ films without authorization, there is no evidence such unauthorized distribution
was part of these Defendants’ scheme. Finally, Bassett's vague references to other homeowners or copyright holders who
suffered similar harm do not transform her highly fact-specific injuries into a RICO scheme.

XI. Defamation
The four elements of a defamation claim under Massachusetts law are:

(1) that ""[t]he defendant made a statement, concerning the plaintiff, to a third party""; (2) that the statement was
defamatory such that it ""could damage the plaintiff's reputation in the community""; (3) that ""[t]he defendant was at
fault in making the statement""; and (4) that ""[t]he statement either caused the plaintiff economic loss ... or is
actionable without proof of economic loss.""

Shay v. Walters . 702 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting Ravnikar v. Bogojaviensky , 438 Mass. 627 , 782 N.E.2d 508 ,
510-11 (Mass. 2003) ).



--- Page 11 ---
Statements of pure opinion are constitutionally protected and cannot be considered ""defamatory"" because ""they are not
susceptible of being proved true or false."" Piccone v. Bartels , 785 F.3d 766 , 771 (1st Cir. 2015). Even if an opinion implies
a provably false assertion of fact, that statement will not be actionable if ""it is plain that the speaker is expressing a
subjective view, an interpretation, a theory, conjecture, or surmise, rather than claiming to be in possession of objectively
verifiable facts."" Riley v. Harr , 292 F.3d 282 , 289 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Gray v. St. Martin's Press. Inc. , 221 F.3d 243,
248 (1st Cir. 2000) ). A speaker is protected from

459 F.Supp.3d 316]

defamation liability if he ""communicates the non-defamatory facts that undergird his opinion."" Piccone , 785 F.3d at 771.

Bassett's defamation claim is based on statements in a social media post by Jensen and a blog by a Mile High production
manager, William Gray aka ""Billy Santoro."" Jensen posted on social media that she was ""Fighting homophobic and
ransphobic bullshit,"" but made no direct reference to Bassett or this lawsuit. Dkt. 89-25 at 6.

Gray's blog post explicitly discussed Bassett's lawsuit and described it as filed by ""a viciously homophobic and transphobic
woman."" Dkt. 11 4 65. This statement ""express[es] a subjective view, ... rather than claiming to be in possession of
objectively verifiable facts."" See Riley , 292 F.3d at 289 . Gray's assessment of Bassett's character was based on her filing
his lawsuit. A reasonable reader would not infer that the author possessed further information not accessible to others. See
Phantom Touring, Inc. v. Affiliated Publ'ns , 953 F.2d 724 , 730-31 (1st Cir. 1992). Instead, the assertion that Bassett was
motivated by prejudice ""reasonably could be understood only as [Gray's] personal conclusion about the information
presented, not as a statement of fact."" Id. at 730.

BASSETT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Bassett cross-moves for summary judgment on four counts: copyright infringement, infliction of emotional distress, Chapter
93A and civil conspiracy. In analyzing Bassett's cross-motion, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to
Defendants. See Lawless , 894 F.3d at 21 .

Beginning with infliction of emotional distress (Count VII), there remain disputed issues of fact on several elements of
Bassett's IIED claim. A reasonable factfinder could decide that Defendants should not have known Bassett was likely to
learn of their activities and suffer distress, as required to meet the intent element. A reasonable factfinder could also
determine that Defendants’ actions were not so “utterly intolerable in a civilized community"" as to meet the extreme and
outrageous element. McGrath , 22 F. Supp. 3d at 70. Bassett did not seek summary judgment as to NIED.

Bassett's viable claim for civil conspiracy (Count V) relies on the facts underlying her tort claims for infliction of emotional
distress and interference with contractual relations. In addition to the disputed issues of fact regarding IIED discussed
above, there remain disputed facts on the interference claim, such as whether Jensen knew the terms of Spafford's lease,
whether she threatened Spafford, and whether she was acting as an agent of Jon Blitt and Mile High. Finally, there are
disputed issues as to whether Defendants’ acts were unfair and deceptive and caused Bassett injury (Count IV).

Because the Court requires further submissions from Bassett to analyze the de minimis doctrine, it defers ruling on Count
IX, the copyright infringement claim.

ORDER

Defendants’ motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 86) is ALLOWED as to Counts | (Breach of Contract), Il (Trespass), III
(Negligence), VI (Civil Fraud), X (Civil RICO), and XI (Defamation) and DENIED as to Counts IV (Chapter 93A), V (Civil
Conspiracy), VII (Infliction of Emotional and Mental Distress), and VIII (Interference with Contractual Relations). Bassett's
motion for partial summary judgment

[459 F.Supp.3d 317]
(Dkt. 99) is DENIED as to Counts IV, V, and VII.

The Court defers ruling on both parties’ motions as to the copyright claim (Count IX) pending Bassett's submission, within 45
days, of a spreadsheet or other analysis that describes exactly how long each copyrighted work appears in each film, with
accompanying screenshots for each period of time. The stay on damages discovery remains in place until the Court rules on
the copyright claim.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:
1 Although Bassett named additional defendants in this action, including Spafford, no other defendant remaining in the case has entered an appearance.

2By contrast, Defendants’ post-lawsuit conduct of allegedly refusing to take down infringing videos and labeling Bassett as homophobic falls into the
category of ""insults, indignities, threats, annoyances [or] petty oppressions"" which cannot form the basis of an IIED claim. See Roman v. Tr. of Tufts Coll.
461 Mass. 707 , 964 N.E.2d 331 , 341 (2012) (citation omitted).

3 Massachusetts also recognizes a ""very limited"" form of civil conspiracy where ""it is the act of agreeing that constitutes the wrong"" such as ""[cJollusive


--- Page 12 ---
behavior among market competitors."" Snyder v. Collura , 812 F.3d 46 , 52 (1st Cir. 2016). It does not apply here.

4 Even if Bassett's trespass claim were based on the general unauthorized entry of Jensen and Mile High-affiliated parties, Bassett learned of that entry
on March 16, 2015, when her mother encountered ""strangers"" on the property.

3 Gray is a named co-defendant but has not filed an appearance in this case.

Before NEWMAN and KEARSE, Circuit Judges, and DALY, ” District Judge.
NEWMAN, Circuit Judge:

Although the 1976 Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. app. §§ 101-810 (1976), prospectively ended the era of common-law
copyright as of January 1, 1978, ' troublesome questions will continue to arise for some time concerning the availability of
pre-1978 common law protection for intellectual property. ? Some of those questions are among the issues presented by this
appeal from a judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, awarding compensatory and punitive
damages to plaintiffs-appellees Roy Export Co. and others ° for statutory and common-law copyright infringement and unfair
competition by defendant-appellant Columbia Broadcasting Systems, Inc. (CBS). The underlying action arose from CBS's
1977 network television broadcast of a film biography of Charlie Chaplin, which included a collection of film clips from six of
Chaplin's motion pictures in which the plaintiffs hold exclusive rights. *On appeal, CBS primarily attacks the bases of those
claims against it that are grounded in state law, arguing that the plaintiffs had no common-law copyright in any of the works
at issue and that the plaintiffs' tort claim for unfair competition was preempted by the federal copyright statute. CBS also
argues that the damages award was excessive and duplicative and that, in any event, its conduct was protected by the First
Amendment. We reject all of these contentions and affirm the judgment of the District Court.

To understand the relationship among the several works involved in this controversy, it is necessary to trace the history
of the parties' competing efforts to create a film memorial to Charlie Chaplin. In 1972, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences (""AMPAS"") asked Bert Schneider, who along with Mo Rothman acted as the plaintiffs' representative in all
matters relevant to this case, to supervise the making of a tribute to Chaplin, in the form of highlights from his motion
pictures, to be shown in connection with a proposed appearance by Chaplin at the 1972 Academy Awards ceremony.
Schneider in turn secured the services of director Peter Bogdanovich and,

Page 1098

through Bogdanovich, of film editor Richard Patterson. Schneider, Bogdanovich, and Patterson then selected and edited a
series of classic scenes from Chaplin's movies, planned the sequence and timing of the scenes, and produced the
""Compilation,"" 5 a thirteen-minute film montage of the master's greatest hits. The Compilation was televised nationally by
NBC as part of the 1972 Academy Awards, at which Chaplin received a special award. It was understood that AMPAS's right
to use the Compilation was strictly limited to that one-time showing, and the plaintiffs have not authorized the showing of the
Compilation since that date.

In 1973, CBS began work on a retrospective of Chaplin's life, intended for use as a film obituary when Chaplin died.
CBS soon learned, however, that the plaintiffs held all rights in the films involved here and that, despite repeated requests,
plaintiffs would not grant CBS permission to use the films. The plaintiffs explained their refusal by informing CBS that they
had begun production of their own ""definitive"" Chaplin biography, ""The Gentleman Tramp,"" and therefore would not
relinquish their copyright advantage. Rebuffed, CBS prepared a ""rough cut"" of a Chaplin biography, consisting primarily of
public domain footage. The plaintiffs meanwhile completed work on ""The Gentleman Tramp,"" which included some of the
same film segments collected in the Compilation but did not use the Compilation itself. The plaintiffs planned to license ""The
Gentleman Tramp"" to theaters abroad and to television networks in the United States. Twice during 1976 and 1977, in fact,
the plaintiffs attempted to sell CBS such a license. CBS did not purchase the license, content for the time being with its


--- Page 2 ---
""rough cut.""

Charlie Chaplin died on December 25, 1977. Although CBS had its ""rough cut"" biography ready for showing, the
network elected not to use it, preferring instead to use a copy of the Compilation obtained from NBC. NBC had kept a
videotape of the Compilation from its 1972 telecast of the Academy Awards and had provided CBS News with a copy of the
videotape on the assurance that CBS would show only brief portions of the excerpted films and only on its regular nightly
news program. The copy, however, appears to have found its way to Russell Bensley, director of the CBS Special Events
Unit. Although Bensley knew of the plaintiffs’ repeated refusals to grant CBS permission to use excerpts from the
copyrighted films, and although Bensley was unable to reach Schneider or Rothman to make an eleventh-hour plea for
reconsideration, CBS decided to put together a new version of a Chaplin biography, incorporating, with minor editing, the
Compilation obtained from NBC. The newer version, heavily dependent on what CBS knew to be copyrighted material, was
broadcast on December 26, 1977, in preference to the legally less vulnerable ""rough cut.""

The broadcast occasioned the plaintiffs' damage suit. They claimed (1) that the broadcast's use of the Chaplin film clips
infringed their statutory copyrights in the films, (2) that the use of the clips in the particular form of the Compilation infringed
a common-law copyright in the Compilation itself as an unpublished independent creation, and (3) that the broadcast
competed unfairly with the plaintiffs’ own Chaplin retrospective, ""The Gentleman Tramp,"" whose marketability the plaintiffs
had intended to protect with their copyrights in its constituent material. After a trial in September and October of 1979 before
Judge Robert J. Ward in the Southern District of New York, the jury found CBS liable to the plaintiffs for $307,281
compensatory and $410,000 punitive damages. ©

Page 1099
CBS's post-trial motions were denied in a comprehensive opinion by Judge Morris E. Lasker, ’ who also granted the

plaintiffs’ cross-motion for an additional award of statutory damages in the amount of $5,000. Roy Export Co. v. CBS, 503
F.Supp. 1137 (S.D.N.Y.1980) . This appeal followed.

A. The First Amendment

CBS first asserts a generalized First Amendment privilege as a bar to the plaintiffs’ claims, arguing that a right to report
newsworthy events such as Chaplin's death shields it from liability. CBS points out that the principal reason for Chaplin's
‘ame is to be found in his films, and argues that it is therefore meaningless to attempt a full account of his life without making
some use of the very things that make that life worth remembering. CBS claims a limited right to use the ""gems"" of Chaplin's
motion pictures-specifically, those film clips collected in the Compilation-in order adequately to memorialize him at his death.
In addition, CBS claims a similar right to use the particular form in which it broadcast the clips, i.e., the Compilation, instead
of simply showing independently excerpted film segments. In CBS's view, the 1972 Academy Awards ceremony, at which
he Compilation received its single public showing, was an ""irreducible single news event"" to which the showing of the
Compilation was integral. The significance of the ceremony, CBS contends, was not simply that Chaplin appeared after a
wenty-year exile provoked by Senator McCarthy's investigations, but that a collection of his work was shown, thereby
bringing home to the American people both what they had been deprived of by McCarthyism and how ludicrous had been
he attempt to find subversive political innuendo in Chaplin's films. CBS concludes that the plaintiffs’ claims for infringement
of the copyrights in the films and the Compilation must give way to an asserted First Amendment news-reporting privilege.

CBS's arguments are unpersuasive. It rests its theory on Professor Nimmer's hypothesis that someday, on some facts,
here might be such an inseparability of an idea and the form of its expression that protecting free dissemination of the one
would necessarily entail subordinating copyright in the other. See 1 M. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 1.10(C)(2) (1981)
(hereafter ""Nimmer ""). Professor Nimmer suggests that the Vietnam War photographs of the My Lai massacre, or the
Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination, ® might be among the rare instances in which ""the visual impact of a graphic
work made a unique contribution to an enlightened democratic dialogue,"" id. at 1-82 to -83, rendering the news photograph
itself essential for understanding the event, and therefore precluding copyright protections.

No Circuit that has considered the question, however, has ever held that the First Amendment provides a privilege in
the copyright field distinct from the accommodation embodied in the ""fair use"" doctrine. 9

Page 1100

See, e.g., Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. Inc. v. Scoreboard Posters, Inc., 600 F.2d 1184 , 1188 (5th Cir. 1979); Walt Disney
Productions v. Air Pirates, 581 F.2d 751 , 758-59 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied,439 U.S. 1132 , 99 S.Ct. 1054 , 59 L.Ed.2d 94
(1979) ; Wainwright Securities, Inc. v. Wall Street Transcript Corp., 558 F.2d 91 , 95 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied,434 U.S.
1014 , 98 S.Ct. 730 , 54 L.Ed.2d 759 (1978) . 1° In this Circuit, while we have acknowledged in passing the conceivable
occurrence of some ""rare,"" ""almost unique"" circumstance, such as those surrounding the Zapruder film, in which ""it is at
least arguable that the informational value of (the) film cannot be separated from the photographer's expression, ... thereby
indicating that both should be in the public domain,"" lowa State University Research Foundation, Inc. v. American
Broadcasting Cos., 621 F.2d 57 , 61 n.6 (2d Cir. 1980), we have also stated the general rule that ""(c)onflicts between
interests protected by the first amendment and the copyright laws thus far have been resolved by application of the fair use
doctrine,"" Wainwright Securities, Inc. v. Wall Street Transcript Corp., supra, 558 F.2d at 95 .

Moreover, even if we were inclined to recognize some narrow exception on extraordinary facts, we would still conclude
that the facts in this case could not support the invention or application of even a limited privilege. '' The showing of
copyrighted films was not essential to CBS's news report of Charlie Chaplin's death or to its assessment of his place in


--- Page 3 ---
history; public domain films were available for the purpose, and the public is already generally familiar with his work. Nor
was the showing of the Compilation essential to a report on the 1972 Academy Awards ceremony. As Judge Lasker noted in
his opinion in the District Court, ""The audiovisual news event, if there was one, was Chaplin's appearance, not the showing
of his work, and certainly not the precise artistic means through which his films were showcased (the Compilation)."" 503.
F.Supp. at 1148 . That the films and the Compilation have historic significance incidental to the events of Charlie Chaplin's
life does not place them in the public domain. We conclude on the facts of this case that CBS's effort to secure a First
Amendment news-reporting exception to the copyright laws cannot succeed.

B. Common-Law Copyright

CBS next contends that the plaintiffs cannot sue for infringement of a common-law copyright in the Compilation
because events have terminated the existence of such a common-law right. The contention arises from the fact that AMPAS
affixed a copyright notice in its name to the entire telecast of the 1972 Academy Awards ceremony, during which the
Compilation was publicly aired pursuant to AMPAS' one-time-only license. CBS explicitly argues that AMPAS thereby
acquired a statutory copyright in the entire show, including the Compilation; its argument implies that if AMPAS does not
have a statutory copyright, then either the plaintiffs have a statutory copyright, or the Compilation is in the

Page 1101

public domain. '? Any of these theories would defeat the plaintiffs’ claim of common-law rights in the Compilation. Assessing
them requires brief exploration of copyright law prior to the 1976 Act.

The 1909 Copyright Act protects eligible works that are ""published"" with a copyright notice, 17 U.S.C. § 10 (1976);
section 2 of the Act specifically excepts from coverage (and from preemption) the common-law right of an author of an
""unpublished"" work. 17 U.S.C. § 2. Thus, under the statutory scheme, ""publication"" generally determines whether state or
federal law is the source of any available copyright protection. State law protection begins with a work's creation and
continues until the work is ""published,"" at which point state protection is lost. The owner secures federal protection by
complying with the requirements of the 1909 Act; if he does not, his published work is in the public domain. 19

Ascertaining whether publication has occurred, however, is not a simple task. The difficulty arises not only from the
normal variety of rulings that are to be expected when courts endeavor to apply an imprecise concept to diverse factual
patterns. In addition, and pertinent to our case, is the difficulty arising from the fact that some courts have used ""publication""
in two different senses, applying different standards depending on the consequences of finding a publication. See Hirshon v.
United Artists Corp., 243 F.2d 640 , 644-45 (D.C.Cir.1957); American Visuals Corp. v. Holland, 239 F.2d 740 , 743-44 (2d
Cir. 1956). Frequently, when courts speak of ""publication,"" they mean a distribution or other occurrence that has the
consequence of leaving an author with no copyright protection: the publication divests him of his common-law copyright, and
he secures no statutory protection because he has not affixed a statutory notice in his name. See, e.g., White v. Kimmel
193 F.2d 744 , 746-47 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 343 U.S. 957 , 72 S.Ct. 1052 , 96 L.Ed. 1357 (1952) ; National Comics
Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.. 191 F.2d 594 , 598 (2d Cir. 1951). When such a ""divestive"" publication
occurs, the author's work enters the public domain. In other circumstances, however, courts use ""publication"" to mean a
distribution sufficient to gain statutory protection for the author who has affixed statutory notice to a copy of his work. See,
e.g., Technicon Medical Information Systems Corp. v. Green Bay Packaging, Inc., No. 78-C-363 (E.D.Wis. Sept. 9, 1980);
Cardinal Film Corp. v. Beck, 248 F. 368 (S.D.N.Y.1918). When such an ""investive"" publication occurs, the author has simply
replaced his common-law protection with statutory protection. When courts are confronted with ascertaining whether
publication has occurred, they sometimes insist upon a more extensive factual

Page 1102

basis for finding a ""divestive"" publication than they might have required for finding an ""investive"" publication. 14 See
American Visuals Corp. v. Holland, supra, 239 F.2d at 743 ; 1 Nimmer § 4.13(C). The use of a higher standard for ""divestive""
publication carries out the policy of the copyright laws to safeguard an author's rights in his works against both piracy and
unwitting forfeiture.

The issue of ""publication"" takes on a further complexity when an author's unpublished work is included as one
component of a collective work. Normally, publication of a collective work is also a publication of its preexisting component
works. See 1 Nimmer § 4.12, at 4-57 n.1. '§ As Professor Nimmer has noted, however, ""(T)here is surprisingly little case
authority on the question,"" id. at 4-57. Moreover, what case law there is applies the general principle in contexts where the
fact of publication was relatively clear: a ""divestive"" publication had occurred requiring that common-law copyright be
sacrificed whether or not the owner would simultaneously be invested with a statutory copyright. If, by contrast, the
publication of the collective work is sufficient only to be deemed ""investive,"" then the status of the unpublished component is
less certain. Perhaps this is why Professor Nimmer says only that publication of a collective work prior to the effective date
of the current Copyright Act ""might"" divest rights in an underlying work previously protected by common-law copyright. Id. §
3.04, at 3-12 n.3.

The uncertainty exists because when an event is adequate to be ""investive"" but not ""divestive,"" the distinction implies
that the single event may constitute publication as to some works or some parties but not as to others, depending on the
legal consequences of the determination. If all copyright in a work will be lost, the particular event might not be a publication
as to that work; if one copyright will simply be exchanged for another, the same event can safely be labeled a publication for
the purpose of acquiring the statutory right. As a result, especially when the proprietor of the component is not the same as
the proprietor of the collective work, the legal statuses of the collective work and its preexisting components are potentially


--- Page 4 ---
independent: if there will be different effects on the rights of different proprietors, an event sufficient to be ""investive"" but not
""divestive"" may be deemed a publication as to the collective work but not as to the component.

In this case, it is clear that the 1972 Academy Awards telecast was a collective work that included among its
components the Compilation (just as the Compilation was itself a collective work made up of excerpts from the Chaplin
ilms). CBS contends that the 1972 telecast, with AMPAS's copyright notice affixed, was an ""investing publication,""
Appellant's Brief at 27, by which AMPAS became ""invested with legal ownership of a statutory copyright in all parts of the
broadcast,"" Appellant's Reply Brief at 13, and after which ""any alleged common law copyright in the Compilation terminated,""
ibid. The plaintiffs respond that a telecast is a performance and therefore not a publication, and that, even if the telecast was
a publication, it would not affect the plaintiffs’ common-law rights in the Compilation. If AMPAS were pursuing a claim under
he federal statute for some infringement of its rights in the entire Awards telecast, it is possible that we would find that the
showing, with AMPAS's affixation of notice, was enough of a publication to invest AMPAS with a statutory copyright in the
elecast. ‘6 Because of

Page 1103

hat possibility, we will assume that the 1972 telecast with copyright notice affixed was an ""investing"" publication as to
AMPAS. We therefore face CBS's arguments concerning the effect of that publication upon the plaintiffs’ common-law
copyright in the Compilation.

The possibility that AMPAS acquired a statutory copyright in the Compilation may be readily rejected. It is axiomatic
hat copyright is a protection for an original work. See 1 Nimmer § 2.01. Without an assignment from the proprietor of a
component, the compiler of a collective work cannot secure copyright protection for preexisting components that he did not
create; protection is available only for that part of his product that is original with him-for what he has added to the
component works, or for his skill and creativity in selecting and assembling an original arrangement of those works, even if
no new material is added. See 17 U.S.C. § 7 (1976); 17 Durham Industries, Inc. v. Tomy Corp.. 630 F.2d 905 , 909 (2d Cir.
1980); Mills Music, Inc. v. Cromwell Music, Inc., 126 F.Supp. 54 , 65 (S.D.N.Y.1954); 1 Nimmer § 3.03. For example, when
the plaintiffs created the Compilation, they became eligible for copyright protection (common-law or statutory) because the
Compilation is an original creative work, distinct from the films on which it draws. But AMPAS made no creative contribution
to the Compilation. Without any assignment from the plaintiffs of proprietary rights in the Compilation, the statutory rights
AMPAS may have acquired in the telecast can extend only to its original contribution to that collective work, not to the pre-
existing Compilation. See Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Cos., 538 F.2d 14 , 19-20 (2d Cir. 1976). '®

Page 1104

The possibility that the 1972 telecast placed the Compilation in the public domain must also be rejected. Even if the
telecast was an ""investing"" publication sufficient to confer statutory rights to the collective work upon AMPAS, in whose
name the copyright notice appeared, that one-time showing of the Compilation was only a ""performance"" which cannot
constitute a ""divesting"" publication. See Burke v. National Broadcasting Co., 598 F.2d 688 , 691, 693 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,
444 U.S. 869 , 100 S.Ct. 144 , 62 L.Ed.2d 93 (1979) ; Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Documentaries Unlimited, Inc.
42 Misc.2d 723 , 727, 248 N.Y.S.2d 809 , 812-13 (Sup.Ct.1964); De Mille Co. v. Casey, 121 Misc. 78 , 87-88, 201 N.Y.S. 20
, 28 (Sup.Ct.1923); 1 Nimmer § 4.11(B), at 4-55. As we have noted, rigorous standards apply in determining when
distribution of copies of a work constitutes a ""publication"" sufficient to cause a loss of common-law copyright without
acquisition of statutory protection. We therefore conclude that the Compilation is not in the public domain.

There remains for consideration the possibility that the 1972 telecast conferred statutory protection for the Compilation
upon the plaintiffs, forcing on them an unintended exchange of their common-law copyright. We held in Goodis v. United
Artists Television, Inc., 425 F.2d 397 (2d Cir. 1970) , that the author of a novel, serialized in the Saturday Evening Post,
obtained a statutory copyright in his novel as a consequence of the Post 's obtaining copyright protection for each issue of
the magazine by affixing to each issue a copyright notice in the Post 's name.

Though superficially analogous to this case, Goodis does not require a conclusion that the plaintiffs have unwittingly
obtained a statutory copyright in the Compilation. Goodis accorded statutory protection to the author of the novel in
response to the argument of his infringer that publication by the Post had placed the novel in the public domain. That
publication, involving nationwide distribution of copies of a magazine, was a ""divesting"" publication that unquestionably
terminated the author's common-law rights. Goodis explicitly accorded the author statutory rights to protect him from
unintentional forfeiture of all his rights due to publication with copyright notice in the ""wrong"" name. See 425 F.2d at 400 . By
contrast, the plaintiffs need no such protection because the 1972 telecast was not a ""divesting"" publication. Their common-
law rights remain intact. The protective rationale of Goodis cannot be used to force a holder of a common-law copyright to
exchange it for statutory rights, simply because the work was included in an ""investing"" publication of a collective work
bearing a copyright notice in the compiler's name.

We conclude that the District Court properly permitted the jury to find that CBS infringed the plaintiffs’ valid common-law
copyright in the Compilation.

C. Unfair Competition

CBS next contends that the plaintiffs may not maintain a claim that the CBS Chaplin retrospective unfairly competed
with plaintiffs’ plan to license ""The Gentleman Tramp."" The argument implicitly questions whether New York unfair
competition law applies to the taking of one item of a plaintiff's property (the Compilation) and its use in competition with


--- Page 5 ---
another item (""The Gentleman Tramp""). Explicitly, the argument asserts that the plaintiffs’
Page 1105

claim, nominally based on misappropriation of the Compilation, ultimately rests on appropriation of the films, and that a state
law claim based on misappropriation of federally copyrighted materials is preempted under the doctrine of Sears, Roebuck &
Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225 , 84 S.Ct. 784 , 11 L.Ed.2d 661 (1964) , and Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting. Inc., 376
U.S. 234 , 84 S.Ct. 779 , 11 L.Ed.2d 669 (1964) . We consider, first, whether CBS's use of the Compilation is unfair
competition under New York law and, second, whether such a state law claim is preempted in the circumstances of this
case.

The misappropriation branch of the unfair competition tort traces its lineage to the Supreme Court's decision in
International News Service v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215 , 39 S.Ct. 68 , 63 L.Ed. 211 (1918) , upholding a decision
enjoining INS from copying AP's news bulletins, which AP had compiled at considerable effort and expense, and then selling
he pirated information in competition with AP. With the subsequent decline of general federal common law, the doctrine was
developed by the states, New York in particular; there it has flourished in a variety of factual settings, see Metropolitan
Opera Ass'n v. Wagner-Nichols Recorder Corp., 199 Misc. 786 , 792-96, 101 N.Y.S.2d 483 , 488-93 (Sup.Ct.1950), aff'd
mem., 279 A.D. 632 , 107 N.Y.S.2d 795 (1951) , despite some early efforts by this Court to limit the doctrine to the narrow
circumstances of the INS case, see, e.g., RCA Manufacturing Co. v. Whiteman, 114 F.2d 86 , 90 (2d Cir.), cert. denied,311
U.S. 712 ,61 S.Ct. 393 , 85 L.Ed. 463 (1940) . See generally Developments in the Law-Competitive Torts, 77 Harv.L.Rev.
888, 933-35 (1964).

An unfair competition claim involving misappropriation usually concerns the taking and use of the plaintiff's property to
compete against the plaintiff's own use of the same property, e.g., International News Service v. Associated Press, supra.
By contrast, in this case the Compilation was taken and used to compete unfairly against a different property, ""The
Gentleman Tramp."" Despite the unusual facts, we are satisfied that the plaintiffs have established an unfair competition tort
under New York law.

New York courts have noted the ""incalculable variety"" of illegal practices falling within the unfair competition rubric,
Ronson Art Metal Works, Inc. v. Gibson Lighter Manufacturing Co., 3 A.D.2d 227 , 230-31, 159 N.Y.S.2d 606 , 609 (1957),
calling it a ""broad and flexible doctrine"" that depends ""more upon the facts set forth ... than in most causes of action,""
Metropolitan Opera Ass'n v. Wagner-Nichols Recorder Corp., supra, 199 Misc. at 792 , 101 N.Y.S.2d at 488 , 489. It has
been broadly described as encompassing ""any form of commercial immorality,"" id. at 796, 101 N.Y.S.2d at 492 , or simply
as ""endeavoring to reap where (one) has not sown,"" International News Service v. Associated Press, supra, 248 U.S. at 239
, 39 S.Ct. at 72 ; it is taking ""the skill, expenditures and labors of a competitor,""Electrolux Corp. v. Val-Worth, Inc., 6 N.Y.2d
556 , 567, 190 N.Y.S.2d 977 , 986, 161 N.E.2d 197 , 203 (1959), and ""misappropriati(ng) for the commercial advantage of
one person ... a benefit or ‘property’ right belonging to another,"" Metropolitan Opera Ass'n v. Wagner-Nichols Recorder
Corp., supra, 199 Misc. at 793 , 101 N.Y.S.2d at 489 . The tort is adaptable and capacious. While it might be objected that
such an amorphous cause of action is capable of mischievous application, even a modest interpretation comprehends the
facts of this case. CBS unquestionably appropriated the ""skill, expenditures and labor"" of the plaintiffs to its own commercial
advantage. Its actions, in apparent violation of its own and the industry's guidelines, were arguably a form of ""commercial
immorality."" We are confident that the New York courts would call its conduct unfair competition.

We next consider whether the plaintiffs’ unfair competition claim, though focusing
Page 1106

on misappropriation of the Compilation, is so inextricably related to CBS's use of excerpts from the copyrighted films as to
encounter a possible preemption defense based on Sears-Compco. It is true that part of the reason CBS's 1977
retrospective was alleged to have undermined the marketability of ""The Gentleman Tramp"" was that the retrospective
invaded the plaintiff's legal monopoly in the copyrighted Chaplin films, a monopoly they naturally relied upon to distinguish
their biography from any competitor's. Nevertheless, the act of taking the Compilation, as an entity apart from the films,
defines a distinct offense, caused distinct damage, and was the basis of the jury's finding of liability for unfair competition.
The commercial effectiveness of CBS's retrospective and the efficiency with which it was produced and shown were
undoubtedly enhanced by the use of the plaintiffs’ artistry in fashioning the Compilation from the raw material of the films.
Moreover, CBS's conduct in obtaining the Compilation from NBC was commercially wrongful in a more serious way than use
of film excerpts would have been. A decision to use isolated film clips to memorialize Chaplin's life could perhaps have been
viewed as an act done in the good faith belief that such use was fair; but the additional decision not only to use the film clips,
but to use them in a distinct and original form whose commercial potential, as CBS knew, reflected someone else's effort and
creativity, precludes any thought of good faith. Under the circumstances, we think that the misappropriation is what renders
unfair CBS's competition with ""The Gentleman Tramp."" Indeed, the plaintiffs, as owners of the Compilation, would have had
a viable claim for unfair competition even if they did not hold copyrights in the films.

Since the unfair competition claim is sufficiently based on the misappropriation of the Compilation, as distinct from the
copyrighted films, the claim is not vulnerable to a preemption defense. Application of state unfair competition laws to
unpublished works protected by common-law copyright is preserved from preemption, 17 U.S.C. § 2, and unaffected by the
Sears-Compco preemption doctrine. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Documentaries Unlimited, Inc., supra, 42
Misc.2d at 726 , 248 N.Y.S.2d at 812 . We therefore uphold the unfair competition claim. 19

D. Damages


--- Page 6 ---
CBS objects to the punitive damages awarded against it on the two common-law claims, arguing that punitive damages
on such claims are contrary to law and public policy, and that the award is excessive, duplicative, and the result of passion
and prejudice. We agree with Judge Lasker's careful analysis of these objections and with his conclusion that they are
meritless. New York law clearly permits punitive damages where a wrong is aggravated by recklessness or willfulness, Le
Mistral, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 61 A.D.2d 491 , 495, 402 N.Y.S.2d 815 , 817 (1978), whether or not directed
against the public generally, Borkowski v. Borkowski, 39 N.Y.2d 982 , 387 N.Y.S.2d 233 , 355 N.E.2d 287 (1976) . CBS's
further attempt to construct a preclusive federal policy from the First Amendment and the federal copyright law is equally
unavailing. We have already concluded that CBS's conduct enjoyed no constitutional protection, and the policies prohibiting
punitive damages in federal infringement actions are irrelevant to actions brought under state law.

As to the claim of excess amount, Judge Lasker correctly noted that punitive damages are within the jury's discretion
and will not be disturbed unless they are grossly excessive. 503 F.Supp. at 1154.

Page 1107

The deterrent potential of an award of $410,000 must be measured by its likely effect on a national television network with
1977 earnings of some $217,000,000, see id. at 1154 n.10. We agree with Judges Ward and Lasker that the award was
neither excessive nor the result of passion and prejudice. On the final question of duplication in the two separate awards of
punitive damages, $300,000 on the common-law copyright claim and $110,000 on the unfair competition claim, we are
satisfied that the awards reflect assessments of distinct harms caused by distinct acts. Moreover, CBS requested the special
verdict forms that elicited the separate awards on the two common-law claims. Having insisted on a fragmented assessment
of punitive damages, CBS cannot complain that the jurors followed their instructions.

For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.

* The Honorable T. F. Gilroy Daly of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.

1 The 1976 Act took effect on January 1, 1978. Pub.L.No. 94-553, § 102, 90 Stat. 2598 (1976). The event occasioning this suit occurred a few days
before, on December 26, 1977. For most purposes the new Act eliminates the prior distinction between common-law and statutory copyright.

2 The questions will concern not only allegations of pre-1978 infringement of common-law rights, like those presented in this case, but, more significantly,
challenges to statutory copyrights, subsisting well into the future, on the ground that the work lost its common-law copyright prior to January 1, 1978,
entered the public domain, and was therefore not eligible for statutory copyright. See 1 M. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 4.01(B) (hereafter ""Nimmer

.

3 Roy Export owns the copyrights in several Charlie Chaplin films. The other plaintiffs hold distribution rights and television, theatrical, and non-theatrical
rights.

4 The six films are ""The Kid,"" ""The Gold Rush,"" ""The Circus,"" ""City Lights,"" ""Modern Times,"" and ""The Great Dictator.""

5 While the parties refer to the work as ""the Compilation,” for copyright law purposes it is more precisely a ""collective work,"" since its components,
excerpts from copyrighted films, are ""independent works in themselves,"" 17 U.S.C. app. § 101 (1976), whereas ""compilation"" is a broader term that
refers to assemblages of materials that may or may not be copyrightable, see ibid.; 1 Nimmer § 3.02, at 3-5, and therefore includes ""collective works.""

6 Of the compensatory total, $7,280 was for statutory copyright infringement, $1 was for common-law copyright infringement, and $300,000 was for
unfair competition. The punitive damages were divided between the common-law claims: $300,000 for common-law copyright infringement and $110,000
for unfair competition.

7 Judge Ward recused himself after the trial pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455 (1976).

8 The unauthorized use of the Zapruder film was at issue in Time Inc. v. Bernard Geis Associates, 293 F.Supp. 130 (S.D.N.Y.1968) . The suit alleged
infringement of the copyright in the film, and the District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants; the court rested its decision on the ""fair
use"" exception, however, not on the First Amendment. Professor Nimmer finds the fair use rationale unpersuasive on the facts of the case and sees in it
an unarticulated First Amendment holding. 1 Nimmer § 1.10(D), at 1-86 to -87.

9 Fair use balances the public interest in the free flow of ideas and information with the copyright holder's interest in exclusive proprietary control of his
work. It permits use of the copyrighted matter ""in a reasonable manner without (the copyright owner's) consent, notwithstanding the monopoly granted to
the owner."" Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 366 F.2d 303 , 306 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1009 , 87 S.Ct. 714, 17
L.Ed.2d 546 (1967) (quoting Ball, The Law of Copyright and Literary Property 260 (1944)). In the District Court, CBS raised a fair use defense to the
statutory copyright infringement claim, and Judge Lasker, after a comprehensive inquiry, concluded that the evidence supported the jury in its finding that
CBS's use was not fair. Roy Export Co. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 503 F.Supp. 1137 , 1143-47 (S.D.N.Y.1980).

10 CBS cites only one District Court opinion, Triangle Publications, Inc. v. Knight-Ridder Newspapers. Inc.. 445 F.Supp. 875 (S.D.Fla.1978) , aff'd on
other grounds, 626 F.2d 1171 (5th Cir. 1980) , where a constitutional privilege has been found in the absence of fair use. In Triangle, the District Court
held that the fair use doctrine did not protect the defendant's use of a photograph of TV Guide's cover in comparative advertisements, but that the First
Amendment nonetheless prevented the issuance of an injunction to stop it. That case is alone in its holding and is not even the law of the Fifth Circuit:
the affirmance found that the use made of the cover was fair, and did not reach the First Amendment issue.

11 We therefore need not consider whether the remedy, in the event of First Amendment protection, would be free use of copyrighted material or a
compulsory license at a reasonable royalty.

12 CBS also argues that AMPAS commissioned the Compilation and therefore holds all rights in it, or if not, that Schneider, Bogdanovich, and Patterson
jointly own the Compilation because they created it. These arguments are insubstantial, and Judge Lasker properly rejected them. As to the first
argument, although AMPAS originally suggested the idea of creating the Compilation, paid Patterson for his work, and bore production costs, Judge
Lasker correctly pointed out that AMPAS exercised no artistic control over the making of the Compilation, that the plaintiffs received no payment for the
use of the Chaplin films and gave AMPAS a license to show the Compilation, and that the parties clearly intended to place ownership of the Compilation
in the plaintiffs’ hands. 503 F.Supp. at 1149-50 . All of these factors are inconsistent with a commission relationship. The second argument is even less
supportable: Schneider worked for the plaintiffs, as their representative, Bogdanovich worked for free, as a favor to Schneider, and Patterson worked at


--- Page 7 ---
Bogdanovich's request. Nothing in the record suggests that any of those involved in making the Compilation supposed that the result belonged to anyone
but the corporate plaintiffs.

13 A related, but distinct, principle is that a single work cannot be protected from copying under both federal and state law at the same time: the
beginning of federal protection marks the end of state protection, even if publication has not occurred. Section 11 of the 1909 Act, 17 U.S.C. § 12 (1976),
permits an author of certain limited categories of unpublished works to secure a federal copyright by registration and deposit. Such ""section 12""
registration extinguishes common-law rights. Photo-Drama Motion Picture Co. v. Social Uplift Film Corp., 220 F. 448, 450 (2d Cir. 1915).

14 Though the cases contain much talk of publication occurring upon the sale of a ""single copy,"" e.g., Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 147 F. 15, 19 (2d Cir.
1906), aff'd, 210 U.S. 339 , 28 S.Ct. 722 , 52 L.Ed. 1086 (1908) , such statements express the thought that availability for public sale constitutes
publication, even if actual sales are minimal.

15 The inverse is presumably also true: an event insufficient to constitute publication of the whole is insufficient to constitute publication of the parts.

16 There are factual circumstances that might render inapplicable the normal rule that a telecast is only a performance. Presumably the 1972 program
was simultaneously videotaped, see 1 Nimmer § 1.08(C), at 1-51, since CBS physically obtained the Compilation from NBC's tape of the 1972 program.
We are not informed, however, whether any ""distribution"" of such a copy, by coaxial cable or otherwise, sufficient to constitute a publication, occurred in
connection with the telecasting of the 1972 Awards ceremony. See id. § 4.11(B), at 4-56.

17 Section 7 provides that ""(c)ompilations ... shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright under the provisions of this title; but the publication of
any such new (collective or derivative) works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed."" The 1976 Act is
even more explicit about the relationship between a collective work and its underlying components:

The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the material contributed by the author of such work, as distinguished from the preexisting
material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material. The copyright in such work is independent of, and does
not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in the preexisting material.

17 U.S.C. app. § 103(b) (1976). The House Report makes clear that this section is intended to clarify an already existing, if not always understood,
aspect of the 1909 Act:

Section 103(b) is also intended to define, more sharply and clearly than does section 7 of the present law, the important interrelationship and correlation

between protection of preexisting and of ""new"" material in a particular work. The most important point here is one that is commonly misunderstood today:
copyright in a ""new version"" covers only the material added by the later author, and has no effect one way or the other on the copyright or public domain

status of the preexisting material.

H.R.Rep.No.1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 57, reprinted in (1976) U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 5659, 5670.

Section 7 of the 1909 Act (and the stronger corresponding language in section 103(b) of the 1976 Act) does not necessarily cause AMPAS's copyright
notice to have no effect on the ""force or validity"" of the plaintiffs‘ common-law copyright. First, despite the language of section 7, a “divestive"" publication
by definition affects the validity of an underlying common-law copyright: it extinguishes it. Second, as we have noted, there is some question about what
sort of ""publication,"" if any, was involved in AMPAS's 1972 telecast.

18 Gilliam concerned an infringement claim by the members of the writing and performing group ""Monty Python"" with respect to a script used for a
licensed BBC broadcast. BBC had obtained a statutory copyright in its program. ABC threatened to use the program, in an allegedly infringing manner,
with the permission of BBC but not of ""Monty Python."" In upholding the plaintiffs’ right to a preliminary injunction, Gilliam broadly stated that ""the copyright
in the underlying script survives intact despite the incorporation of that work into a derivative work."" 538 F.2d at 20 . Citing section 7's provision that the
copyright in a derivative work does not affect the ""force or validity"" of a copyright in an underlying work, the Court observed that ""the same principles (that
apply) to derivative works adapted from material in which there is a statutory copyright also apply to material in which there is a common law copyright.""
Id. at 20 n.3. The plaintiffs here cite Gilliam to show that publication of a derivative work does not extinguish common-law rights in an underlying
component. However, even though the Court ruled that ""Monty Python"" was entitled to a preliminary injunction, the impact of the broadcast upon the
group's common-law rights was specifically left for consideration at trial, since defendant had not objected to the group's ""assertion of common law
copyright in an unpublished script."" Ibid.

19 We need not consider plaintiffs’ further contention that even if the unfair competition claim were substantially based on misappropriation of the
copyrighted films, the claim would not be preempted because the facts of this case indicate no conflict with federal policies.

Before MULLIGAN, OAKES and MESKILL, Circuit Judges.
MESKILL, Circuit Judge:

Plaintiffs below, Rebecca Reyher and Ruth Gannett, appeal from an order of the District Court for the Southern District
of New York, John M. Cannella, Judge, dismissing their copyright infringement complaint after a two day trial without a jury.
We affirm the district court's disposition of this case on the ground that there was no substantial similarity between the two
works as to copyrightable matter.

Appellants Reyher and Gannett are the author and illustrator respectively of a children's book entitled My Mother Is The
Most Beautiful Woman In The World which was published with notice of copyright on August 24, 1945. Appellee Children's
Television Workshop (""CTW"") is the producer of the educational children's television program known as ""Sesame Street""
and the

Page 89

publisher of Sesame Street Magazine. Appellee Tuesday Publications, Inc. (""TPI"") is the publisher of a monthly periodical
known as Tuesday At Home, which is distributed by several newspapers across the country.

The complaint alleges that CTW and TPI infringed and are continuing to infringe plaintiffs’ copyright by publishing an
illustrated story entitled ""The Most Beautiful Woman In The World,"" which plaintiffs claim was copied from their book without
their knowledge or consent. The plaintiffs further assert that CTW infringed their copyright by producing, performing, taping,
and televising, without knowledge or authorization, a television skit entitled ""The Most Beautiful Woman In The World.""

The defendants deny any infringement of plaintiffs’ copyright. They contend that a thematic idea is not protected by
copyright and further, that as a ""retold"" folk tale, the story line involved here is in the public domain. A two day trial was held
before Judge Cannella. The three key witnesses were appellant Reyher, Jon Stone, author of the allegedly infringing script
and executive producer and head writer for ""Sesame Street,"" and Tibor Gergely, the artist who illustrated the script for
Sesame Street Magazine.

Reyher testified that her book My Mother Is The Most Beautiful Woman In The World had its genesis in a story told to
her as a child in Russian by her Russian mother. While she could not repeat this story verbatim, she stated that she had
""taken a storyline . . . (and) adapted it. . . . (It was her) treatment . . . even though it was (her) mother's story."" Later in her
testimony, Reyher said she had only ""assumed"" that the story was a Russian folktale known to others.

Stone testified that he remembered the theme used in his script from a story told to his younger sister more than 20
years ago. Denying that he had ever seen appellants’ work in any form, Stone stated that he used no source for his script
other than his memory. Tibor Gergely, the artist who had sketched the allegedly infringing illustration of the reunion scene
between mother and child, testified that he had referred to no outside materials when illustrating the story, although he
remembered the story from a book read during his childhood in Europe; further, he stated that since he had never seen
appellant Gannett's illustrations, any similarity in the drawings of the reunion scene was coincidental.

Judge Cannella dismissed the infringement claim. He noted that there was substantial similarity between the two works
because ""(w)hile defendants' rendition of the story takes place in a different locale and is told with fewer frills . . . both stories


--- Page 2 ---
present an identical sequence of events."" He concluded, however, that since Reyher testified that the story line in her book
was ""substantially taken from, if not identical with, the story told to her by her mother"" and since she failed to show that she
had added anything to the story or changed it in any significant way, Reyher's book was a derivative work, i. e., one
""substantially copied from a prior work in the public domain."" Reyher's copyright thus protected only her original product,
which did not include the plot. The court found no textual copying. ' In comparing the two illustrations, the district court
concluded that the differences between them were so substantial as to preclude a finding of infringement. 387 F.Supp. 869
(S.D.N.Y.1975) .

Initially we feel that we must note our grave doubts about the district court's characterization of Reyher's book as a
derivative work. In addition to the classes of works eligible for copyright protection under 17 U.S.C. § 5, Section 7 of Title 17
permits copyrighting ""adaptations' . . . translations, or other versions of works in the public domain,"" so long as the
contributions made by the author to the previously

Page 90

existing work are not merely trivial. The protection afforded by § 7, however, is limited solely to the author's additions to the
prior underlying work. Generally, ""(a) work is not derivative unless it has substantially copied from a prior work. If that which
is borrowed consists merely of ideas and not of the expression of ideas, then although the work may have in part been
derived from prior works, it is not a derivative work."" 1 M. Nimmer on Copyright § 39 at 166-167 (1975) (hereinafter
""Nimmer""). This statement presents, we think, the proper perspective from which to evaluate Reyher's book.

Reyher admittedly borrowed the ""idea"" embodied in the story from her mother. The basic plot of this children's book is
very simple. See discussion infra. Reyher's presentation of the story line was entirely her own. Aside from its theme, she
could neither recall the exact story her mother told nor the precise language used. More importantly, no tangible or
intangible prior work was proved with sufficient detail to enable a court to judge either whether substantial copying of
anything other than the idea of the prior work had occurred or which part of her adaptation constituted her own new, and
thus protected, material. In light of the absence of such evidence, to characterize Reyher's work as derivative merely
because she used memories of her mother's story would create problems in protecting any literary endeavor as well as
exacerbate the difficulty in determining the protection to be afforded a particular effort.

Although we disagree with the district court's ""derivative work"" rationale, we nevertheless affirm its dismissal of this
case on the ground that any similarities between the two works related only to non-copyrightable matter. In reaching this
conclusion, we must overturn the trial court's factual finding that there were substantial similarities between the two works.
While we recognize that our appellate function usually does not include factfinding, where, as here, the determination of
similarity rests solely on a comparison of the works in issue rather than on credibility of witnesses or other evidence only for
the factfinder, ""we are in as good a position as the trial judge"" to determine the issue. Soptra Fabrics Corp. v. Stafford
Knitting Mills, Inc., 490 F.2d 1092 , 1093 (2 Cir. 1974);Concord Fabrics, Inc. v. Marcus Brothers Textile Corp., 409 F.2d
1315 , 1317 (2 Cir. 1969) (per curiam );Millworth Converting Corporation v. Slifka, 276 F.2d 443 , 445-446 (2 Cir. 1960); cf.
Orvis v. Higgins. 180 F.2d 537 , 539 (2 Cir.), cert. denied,340 U.S. 810 , 71 S.Ct. 37 , 95 L.Ed. 595 (1950) . See 1 Nimmer §
140 at 607.

In an infringement action, a plaintiff must establish ownership of the copyright and copying by the defendant. McGraw-
Hill, Inc. v. Worth Publishers, Inc., 335 F.Supp. 415 , 419 (S.D.N.Y.1971); 1 Nimmer § 141 at 611. As was done in the
instant case, ownership is commonly proved by production of the copyright registration certificate. Because of the inherent
difficulty in obtaining direct evidence of copying, it is usually proved by circumstantial evidence of access to the copyrighted
work and substantial similarities as to protectible material in the two works. Arnstein v. Porter, 154 F.2d 464 (2 Cir. 1946) ;
Bevan v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 329 F.Supp. 601 (S.D.N.Y.1971) . ""(I)f there are no similarities, no amount of
evidence of access will suffice to prove copying."" Arnstein v. Porter, supra, 154 F.2d at 468 .

It is an axiom of copyright law that the protection granted to a copyrightable work extends only to the particular
expression of an idea and never to the idea itself. Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201 , 217,74 S.Ct. 460 , 470, 98 L.Ed. 630 , 642
(1954); Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99 , 102-103, 25 L.Ed. 841 , 843 (1879). This principle attempts to reconcile two
competing societal interests: rewarding an individual's ingenuity and effort while at the same time permitting the nation to
benefit from further improvements or progress resulting from others’ use of the same subject matter. ""In the case of verbal
‘works’ it is well settled that although the 'proprietor's' monopoly extends

Page 91

beyond an exact reproduction of the words, there can be no copyright in the 'ideas' disclosed but only in their 'expression.'
Obviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the ‘idea,’ and has borrowed its
‘expression.’ Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc."" Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487 ,
489 (2 Cir. 1960) (L. Hand).

The difficult task in an infringement action is to distill the nonprotected idea from protected expression. In Nichols v.
Universal Pictures Corporation, 45 F.2d 119 , 121 (2 Cir. 1930), cert. denied,282 U.S. 902 ,51 S.Ct. 216 , 75 L.Ed. 795
(1931) , Judge Learned Hand articulated his ""abstractions test"" by noting that ""(u)pon any work . . . a great number of
patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well, as more and more of the incident is left out. . . . (T)here is a point in this
series of abstractions where they are no longer protected, since otherwise the playwright could prevent the use of his 'ideas'
to which, apart from their expression, his property is never extended."" Attempting to further delineate this boundary, one
commentator has stated that ""protection covers the 'pattern' of the work . . . the sequence of events and the development of



--- Page 3 ---
the interplay of characters."" 2

While the demarcation between idea and expression may not be susceptible to overly helpful generalization, it has
been emphasized repeatedly that the essence of infringement lies in taking not a general theme but its particular expression
through similarities of treatment, details, scenes, events and characterization. Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures
Corporation,81 F.2d 49 , 54 (2 Cir.), cert. denied,298 U.S. 669 , 56 S.Ct. 835 , 80 L.Ed. 1392 (1936) ; Burnett v. Lambino,
204 F.Supp. 327 (S.D.N.Y.1962) ; Bevan v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., supra,329 F.Supp. at 605 . Another
helpful analytic concept is that of scenes a faire, sequences of events which necessarily follow from a common theme. ""
(S)imilarity of expression . . . which necessarily results from the fact that the common idea is only capable of expression in
more or less stereotyped form will preclude a finding of actionable similarity."" 1 Nimmer § 143.11 at 626.2; see Yankwich,
Originality in the Law of Intellectual Property, 11 F.R.D. 457, 462 (1951). Copyrights, then, do not protect thematic concepts
or scenes which necessarily must follow from certain similar plot situations. Thus, ""no one infringes, unless he descends so
far into what is concrete (in a work) as to invade . . . (its) ‘expression.’ "" National Comics Publications v. Fawcett
Publications, 191 F.2d 594 , 600 (2 Cir. 1951). An example illuminating these somewhat theoretical statements may be
helpful at this point. In Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation, supra, the author of the play ""Abie's Irish Rose"" claimed
that her work had been infringed by defendant's film ""The Cohens and The Kellys."" The court found that the only matter
common to the two stories, a ""quarrel between a Jewish and an Irish father, the marriage of their children, the birth of
grandchildren and a reconciliation,"" was not protected by copyright; similarly, the four characters common to both plays
were prototypes too indistinct to merit copyright protection. The court concluded that ""(a) comedy based upon conflicts
between Irish and Jews, into which the marriage of their children enters,"" was not within the protection afforded by copyright
because this theme was part of plaintiff's ideas.

The question which remains is whether defendants in the instant case utilized the idea in Reyher's book or instead
descended so far into the concrete as to invade her expression. We must first note that both stories, intended for children,
are necessarily less complex than some other works submitted to pattern analysis. See, e. g., Bevan v. Columbia
Broadcasting System, Inc., supra; Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation, supra. Therefore, in addition to the essential
sequence of events, we might properly consider the ""total concept and feel"" of the works in question.

Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Company, 429 F.2d 1106 , 1110 (9 Cir. 1970).

Reyher's thirty-five page book focuses on a Russian family living in the Ukraine; the setting of the story is an important
component of the work. The main protagonists are the mother, father and six year old daughter. The first few pages
describe the duties of each family member in harvesting the wheat crop. There is also narrative about the customary feast
days during harvesting as Reyher describes, through the literary device of the little girl helping her mother, the preparation
of distinctive Russian foods. The feast day itself is depicted with vivid details of costume and entertainment. We have now
progressed through fifteen pages of appellant's book. On the last day of field work prior to the feast, the little girl is
separated from her parents. Meeting a group of villagers unfamiliar to her, she describes her mother as the most beautiful
woman in the world. The village leader sends boys to bring back all the likely candidates; none, of course, is the mother.
Finally, a homely woman, in fact the girl's mother, approaches the crowd and is joyfully reunited with her child. The village
leader presents the moral of the story: ""We do not love people because they are beautiful, but they seem beautiful to us
because we love them."" At the feast day, the little girl tells her mother that, although other children have teased her about
her feelings, she thinks her mother is the most beautiful woman in the world. The mother expresses her happiness that her
child sees with her heart as well as with her eyes.

The Sesame Street Magazine version of the story, two pages long, presumably is set in Africa. There is no textual
detail about African life; any information comes from the five illustrations, which show African dress on the characters, a
woman carrying a basket on her head, and thatched huts. The story opens with a little boy crying in the fields because he
has become separated from his mother. He describes her as the most beautiful woman in the world. The village leader
gathers all the beautiful women from surrounding villages to no avail. An old unattractive woman, the missing mother, is
reunited with her son. The village leader states that although he doesn't find her beautiful, the important thing is what the
little boy thinks. The lesson to be learned is ""(w)hat's not so beautiful to some can be very, very beautiful to others.""

Based on the special relationship between parent and child, both works present the thematic concept that to a lost
child, the familiar face of the mother is the most beautiful face, even though the mother is not, in fact, beautiful to most. >
The overlapping sequences of events concern the lost child finding his or her mother, albeit with some difficulty because of
the description given. This similarity of events, however, may be considered scenes a faire, scenes which necessarily result
from identical situations. 4 Thus, where a lost child is the protagonist, there is likely to be a reunion with parents.
Furthermore, the morals stated by the two stories differ in emphasis. Reyher's book focuses on how love makes people
appear beautiful, while the CTW story stresses that what is beautiful to some may not be beautiful to others. More
importantly, however, the two works differ in ""total feel."" Reyher's book presents a picture of family life in the Russian
Ukraine and develops the characters of the little girl and her mother. The CTW story is barren of meaningful setting or
character development in its attempt to present its theme. The two stories are not similar in mood, details or
characterization. Since both present only the same idea, no infringement

Page 93

as to protected expression occurred. The district court's finding that the two illustrations of the reunion scene have such
substantial differences as not to warrant a finding of infringement is one we will not disturb.


--- Page 4 ---
Affirmed.

ago.""

Before BAUER, EASTERBROOK, and WILLIAMS, Circuit Judges.

EASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge.

While a student at the University of Wisconsin in 1969, Paul Soglin attended the first Mifflin Street Block Party, whose
theme (according to Soglin) was “taking a sharp stick and poking it in the eye of authority.” Now in his seventh term as Mayor
of Madison, Wisconsin, Soglin does not appreciate being on the pointy end. He wants to shut down the annual event. For
the 2012 Block Party, Sconnie Nation made some t-shirts and tank tops displaying an image of Soglin's face and the phrase
“Sorry for Partying.” The 54 sales, on which Sconnie Nation cleared a small profit, led to this suit, in which photographer
Michael Kienitz accuses Sconnie Nation and its vendor of copyright infringement.

Sconnie Nation concedes starting with a photograph that Kienitz took at Soglin's inauguration in 2011. Soglin (with
Kienitz's permission) had posted it on the City's website, from which Sconnie Nation downloaded a copy. The photograph

was posterized, the background was removed, and Soglin's face was turned lime green and surrounded by multi-colored
writing. Here are the original and the revision:

[766 F.3d 758]

A magistrate judge, serving by consent under 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), granted summary judgment for the defendants,
holding that Sconnie Nation had made fair use of the photo. 965 F.Supp.2d 1042 (W.D.Wis.2013) .

Fair use is a statutory defense to infringement. The Copyright Act sets out four non-exclusive factors for a court to
consider. 17 U.S.C. § 107. The district court and the parties have debated whether the t-shirts are a “transformative use” of
the photo—and, if so, just how “transformative” the use must be. That's not one of the statutory factors, though the Supreme
Court mentioned it in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.,510 U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) .
The Second Circuit has run with the suggestion and concluded that “transformative use” is enough to bring a modified copy
within the scope of § 107. See, e.g., Cariou v. Prince, 714 F.3d 694 , 706 (2d Cir.2013). Cariou applied this to an example of
“appropriation art,” in which some of the supposed value comes from the very fact that the work was created by someone
else.

We're skeptical of Cariou's approach, because asking exclusively whether something is “transformative” not only
replaces the list in § 107 but also could override 17 U.S.C. § 106(2), which protects derivative works. To say that a new use
transforms the work is precisely to say that it is derivative and thus, one might suppose, protected under § 106(2). Cariou
and its predecessors in the Second Circuit do no explain how every “transformative use” can be “fair use” without
extinguishing the author's rights under § 106(2).

We think it best to stick with the statutory list, of which the most important usually is the fourth (market effect).We have
asked whether the contested use is a complement to the protected work (allowed) rather than a substitute for it (prohibited).
See Ty. Inc. v. Publications International Ltd., 292 F.3d 512 (7th Cir.2002) ;

[766 F.3d 759]

Chicago Board of Education v. Substance, Inc., 354 F.3d 624 (7th Cir.2003) . A t-shirt or tank top is no substitute for the
original photograph. Nor does Kienitz say that defendants disrupted a plan to license this work for apparel. Kienitz does not

argue that defendants’ products have reduced the demand for the original work or any use of it that he is contemplating.
Here is the list in § 107:

In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall
include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copy righted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

Other than factor (4), which we have discussed already, only (3)—the amount taken in relation to the copyrighted work as a
whole—has much bite in this litigation. Defendants removed so much of the original that, as with the Cheshire Cat, only the
smile remains. Defendants started with a low-resolution version posted on the City's website, so much of the original's detail
never had a chance to reach the copy; the original's background is gone; its colors and shading are gone; the expression in
Soglin's eyes can no longer be read; after the posterization (and reproduction by silk-screening), the effect of the lighting in
the original is almost extinguished. What is left, besides a hint of Soglin's smile, is the outline of his face, which can't be
copyrighted. Defendants could have achieved the same effect by starting with a snap-shot taken on the street.

The other statutory factors don't do much in this case. Consider (1), for example. Defendants sold their products in the
hope of profit, and made a small one, but they chose the design as a form of political commentary. Factor (2) is
unilluminating, and as we have mentioned Kienitz does not argue that defendants’ acts have reduced the value of this
photograph, which he licensed to Soglin at no royalty and which is posted on a public website for viewing and downloading
without cost.

Two things can be said for Kienitz. First, defendants did not need to use the copyrighted work. They wanted to mock
the Mayor, not to comment on Kienitz's skills as a photographer or his artistry in producing this particular photograph.
There's no good reason why defendants should be allowed to appropriate someone else's copyrighted efforts as the starting
point in their lampoon, when so many noncopyrighted alternatives (including snapshots they could have taken themselves)
were available. The fair-use privilege under § 107 is not designed to protect lazy appropriators. Its goal instead is to facilitate
a class of uses that would not be possible if users always had to negotiate with copyright proprietors. (Many copyright
owners would block all parodies, for example, and the administrative costs of finding and obtaining consent from copyright
holders would frustrate many academic uses.)

Second, this use may injure Kienitz's long-range commercial opportunities, even though it does not reduce the value he
derives from this particular picture. He promises his subjects that the photos will be licensed only for dignified uses. Fewer
people will hire or cooperate with Kienitz if they think that the high quality of his work will make the photos more effective

[766 F.3d 760]

when used against them! But Kienitz does not present an argument along these lines, and the consideration in the
preceding paragraph is not enough to offset the fact that, by the time defendants were done, almost none of the copyrighted
work remained. The district court thus reached the right conclusion.
