MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
JED S. RAKOFF, District Judge.

On February 22, 2012, plaintiffs Edward L. White, Edward L. White, P.C., and Kenneth Elan filed a putative class action
alleging copyright infringement against defendants West Publishing Corp. (“West”) and Reed Elsevier, Inc. (“Lexis”). On
June 26, 2012, after the Court had dismissed Elan's claims and those of the proposed subclass of plaintiffs who had not
registered any copyrights, White filed an amended, non-class action complaint, asserting claims of copyright infringement
based on the inclusion of White's copyrighted briefs in West's “Litigator” and Lexis's “Briefs, Pleading and Motions”
databases. On September 28, 2012 and October 5, 2012, defendants and White, respectively, filed cross-motions for
summary judgment on White's copyright infringement claims. The Court heard oral argument on these motions on November
20, 2012 and in a “bottom-line” Order dated February 11, 2013, 2013 WL 544057, granted defendants’ motion for summary
judgment and denied plaintiff's motion. This Memorandum and Order explains the reasons for that decision and directs the
entry of final judgment.

Plaintiffs sue West and Lexis for copyright infringement based on the inclusion of two of White's copyrighted briefs in
the Westlaw “Litigator” and Lexis “Briefs, Pleading and Motions” (BPM) databases. The briefs at issue are “Plaintiffs'
Combined Motion for Summary Judgment, Beer and Ramsey, and Brief in Support” (“Summary Judgment Motion’), filed
May 20, 2009, and “Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine” (“Motion in Limine”), filed March 15, 2010, both of which White filed while
serving as class counsel in Beer v. XTO Energy, Inc., No. Civ-O07—798-L, in the Western District of Oklahoma. Defendant

Copr.'s Statement of Uncontested Material Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 (“West 56.1”) ¢q 16-19.

On April 13, 2010, mid-way through the litigation, the Beer Court removed White as class counsel in Beer and
decertified the class. Id. § 22. Two individuals filed a motion to intervene as new named plaintiffs in Beer with new class
counsel. /d. {| 23-24. Because White was concerned that the newly proposed class counsel or other lawyers would use his
work product, White registered copyrights on the Beer Summary Judgment Motion and Motion in Limine briefs on May 20,
2010, and May 21, 2010, respectively. /d. J 25.

Prior to registering copyrights on the Summary Judgment Motion and Motion in Limine briefs, White filed the motions
with the court using the electronic CM/ECF (PACER) service, from which West and Lexis retrieved the documents. West
56.1 9 26, 27; Def. Reed Elsevier Inc.'s Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Facts in Support of Its Motion for Summary
Judgment (“Lexis 56.1”) ¢§ 10, 23-24. Filing a document on PACER makes that document publicly available online as well
as in the court's clerk's office and allows members of the public to retrieve and download a copy of the document from
PACER for $0.10 per page, up to $3.00 per document. Lexis 56.1 4§ 17, 20, 24-25.

West's Litigator and Lexis's BPM products offer users access to select legal documents that were filed, without seal, in
state and federal courts. West 56.1 4 3-5, 7; Lexis 56.1 9 2-4. Once West or Lexis selects a particular legal document for
inclusion into Litigator or BPM, the document is converted into a text-searchable electronic file and saved in each database's
proprietary format. West 56.1 § 9; Lexis 56.1 § 33. The document is further modified as follows: an editor reviews the
document to redact sensitive and private information, West 56.1 4 11; Lexis 56.1 § 30; the editor codes and/or extracts from
the document key characteristics like jurisdiction and practice area in order to allow users to find and retrieve documents

PDF of the as-filed version of the document is included in the database version of the document to maintain an archival
copy, West 56.1 § 14; Lexis 56.1 39. BPM contains over one million legal documents, and Litigator approximately eleven
million legal documents, obtained either from PACER or from courts directly. Lexis 56.1 995, 7, 1; West 56.1 9 5-6.

The Beer Summary Judgment Motion was loaded into Litigator on July 11, 2009, and accessed a total of five times
between then and March 6, 2012; the Motion in Limine was loaded into Litigator on May 2, 2010, and accessed a total of
seven times between then and March 5, 2012. West 56.1 4 27-28. Both motions were available as part of BPM as of
August 4, 2010; the Summary Judgment motion was never accessed, and the Motion in Limine was accessed by three
users. Lexis 56.1 9 43, 73-74.

Section 107 of the Copyright Act provides a defense to copyright infringement that allows for “fair use” of a copyrighted
work without permission based on consideration of four non-exclusive statutory factors: “(1) the purpose and character of
the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the
copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality

[29 F.Supp.3d 399]

of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for
or value of the copyrighted work....” 17 U.S.C. § 107. The Court finds that three of the above factors weigh in favor of a
finding of fair use, while one of the factors is neutral.

Regarding the first factor, a key issue is: “whether and to what extent the new work is ‘transformative,’ ” Campbell v.
Acuff—Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) , that is, whether how the defendants
have altered and used plaintiff's work has effectively transformed it into a different kind of work. The Court finds that West
and Lexis's use of the briefs was transformative for two reasons. First, while White created the briefs solely for the purpose
of providing legal services to his clients and securing specific legal outcomes in the Beer litigation, the defendants used the
brief toward the end of creating an interactive legal research tool. See Blanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d 244 , 251 (2d Cir.2006)
(‘The sharply different objectives that Koons had in using, and Bland had in creating [the work] confirms the transformative
nature of the use.”). Second, West and Lexis's processes of reviewing, selecting, converting, coding, linking, and identifying
the documents “add[ ] something new, with a further purpose or different character” than the original briefs. Campbell, 510
U.S. Reports 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164. While, to be sure, the transformation was done for a commercial purpose, “the more
transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a
finding of fair use.” Campbell,_510 U. S. Reports 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Thus, on net, the first factor weighs in favor of a
finding of fair use.

Regarding the second factor (the nature of the copyrighted work), “[i]n general, fair use is more likely to be found in
factual works than in fictional works.” Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207 , 237,110 S.Ct. 1750 , 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) . Here,
the briefs at issue are functional presentations of fact and law, and this cuts towards finding in favor of fair use. It is true that
“the scope of fair use is narrower with respect to unpublished works [because] .... the author's right to control the first public
appearance of his expression weighs against use of the work before its release.” Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539 , 564, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . However, while White's briefs were in some
sense unpublished, this factor is made less significant by the fact that White intentionally made the briefs publicly available
by filing them with the court; thus the circumstances of this case do not implicate the rationales for protecting unpublished
works. On net, the second factor also weighs in favor of a finding of fair use.

Regarding the third factor, which looks at “ ‘the quantity and value of the materials used ... in relation to the purpose of
the copying,’ ” Blanch, 467 F.3d at 257 (quoting Campbell, 510 U. S. Reports 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164), although “copying of
an entire work [does not] favor [ ]fair use[,] ... courts have concluded that such copying does not necessarily weigh against
fair use because copying the entirety of a work is sometimes necessary to make a fair use of the image.” Bill Graham
Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605 , 613 (2d Cir.2006). Although defendants here copied the entirety of
White's briefs, such copying was necessary to make the briefs comprehensively text searchable. Thus the Court finds that
defendants only copied what was reasonably necessary for their transformative use, and that the third factor is therefore
neutral.

[29 F.Supp.3d 400]

Regarding the fourth factor, a finding of fair use is disfavored “only when the market is impaired because the ...
material serves the consumer as a substitute, or ... supersedes the use of the original.” Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at
614 (quoting Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L.Rev.. 1105, 1125 (1990)). In determining whether
such a market exists, the Second Circuit “looks at the impact on potential licensing revenues for ‘traditional, reasonable, or
likely to be developed markets.’ ” Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 614 (quoting American Geophysical Union v. Texaco
Inc., 60 F.3d 913 , 930 (2d Cir.1994)). In this instance, West's and Lexis's usage of the briefs is in no way economically a
substitute for the use of the briefs in their original market: the provision of legal advice for an attorney's clients. White himself
admits that he lost no clients as a result of West's and Lexis's usage. Lexis 56.1 § 94. Furthermore, no secondary market



--- Page 3 ---
exists in which White could license or sell the briefs to other attorneys, as no one has offered to license any of White's
motions, nor has White sought to license or sell them. See Blanch, 467 F.3d at 258 (finding that this factor “greatly favor[ed]
the alleged infringer where the copyright holder had “never licensed any of her photographs for use in works of graphic or
other visual art”). Although White argues that Lexis and West impede a market for licensing briefs, the Court finds that no
potential market exists because the transactions costs in licensing attorney works would be prohibitively high. Thus on net,
the fourth factor weighs in favor of defendants and a finding of fair use.

Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the defendants’ use of plaintiff's brief was a fair use. The
Court therefore reaffirms its Order of February 11, 2013, granting defendants' motion for summary judgment. The Clerk of
the Court is directed to enter judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice, and to close the case.

SO ORDERED.

ORDER
WILLIAM F. JUNG, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE

This matter comes before the Court on Defendants Vanguard Productions, LLC's and Jesse David Spurlock's
(collectively, ""Defendants"") Second Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 111) as well as Plaintiffs Holly J. Frazetta's, Heidi L.
Frazetta's, and Frazetta Properties, LLC's (collectively, Plaintiffs"") Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 79). The parties filed
Responses (Dkts. 80, 121) and Defendants filed a Reply (Dkt. 122). Upon careful consideration, the Court grants-in-part and
denies-in-part both Motions.

BACKGROUND

This case involves a dispute over certain artwork of the late Frank Frazetta, whose distinctive material was frequently
used as book cover art for fantasy and science fiction novels. Plaintiffs purport to own the copyright for two of Mr. Frazetta's
works, Death Dealer Il and Death Dealer V:

Death Dealer II Artwork
Image materials not available for display.

Death Dealer V Artwork

Dkt. 1 37. These two artworks are at issue here. Plaintiffs market the copyrighted work in various forms, including books
containing full-page art prints. Dkt. 83-1 at 6-8.

The Death Dealer Il and V artwork appeared on the covers of books one and

[716 F.Supp.3d 1271]

four of the Death Dealer series of novels by author James Silke. Dkt. 1 37. Although Mr. Silke claimed a copyright in the
novels, Mr. Frazetta retained copyright ownership of the books' cover art. Dkt. 100-1 at 25, 27.

Defendant Vanguard Productions, LLC (""Vanguard"") is a publisher with a focus on artist biographies and reference
books. Dkt. 67 § 2. Defendant Spurlock, Vanguard's sole member, is an art historian, teacher, and professional artist. Id. 4
4, 5. Defendants used the cover art for the Death Dealer novels in their recently published book, Frazetta Book Cover Art .

Dkt. 1 9 4, 37. The book includes images of the cover art for Death Dealer books one and four. Dkt. 67-1 at 68, 71. Each
image, accompanied by minimal text, is the focus of one full page of Defendants' book:

Additionally, a small image of Death Dealer book four (featuring the Death Dealer V artwork) appears on the cover of
Frazetta Book Cover Art:

[716 F.Supp.3d 1272]

Image materials not available for display.


--- Page 2 ---
Id. at 1.

Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ reproduction of those two book covers infringed Plaintiffs' copyright ownership in the
Death Dealer II and Death Dealer V artworks, which were on those book covers. Dkt. 1 J 83-115. Plaintiffs also made but
abandoned claims concerning another work, Death Dealer VI. Id. § 3. Plaintiffs sought an injunction preventing Defendants
from selling Frazetta Book Cover Art and brought claims of direct copyright infringement, contributory copyright infringement,
vicarious copyright infringement, and inducement of copyright infringement. /d. 71-115.

Defendants filed separate, but identical, Answers in May 2022 (Dkts. 14, 15). The parties filed cross motions for
summary judgment in August 2023 (Dkts. 67, 79), as well as Responses (Dkt. 80, 82), and Defendants filed a Reply (Dkt.
83). The Court heard oral argument on the summary judgment motions on October 20, 2023.

Following oral argument and with the Court's leave, Defendants filed an Amended Answer (Dkt. 107), denying the
majority of Plaintiff's factual allegations and asserting several affirmative defenses. Also with the Court's leave, Defendants
filed a Second Motion for Summary Judgment. (Dkt. 111). Plaintiffs filed a Response to the Second Motion for Summary
Judgment (Dkt. 121), and Defendants filed a Reply (Dkt. 122). For the reasons outlined below, the Court grants-in-part and
denies-in-part both parties' Motions.

LEGAL STANDARD

A district court should grant summary judgment only when it determines that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp.v.
Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 , 322,106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . An issue of fact is ""material"" if it is a legal element of
the claim that might affect the outcome of the case. Allen v. Tyson Foods, Inc ., 121 F.3d 642 , 646 (11th Cir. 1997). An
issue of fact is ""genuine"" if the record, in its entirety, could lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmovant. Id. The
moving party bears the burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Id.

In deciding a motion for summary judgment, a court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all inferences in favor of the
non-moving

[716 F.Supp.3d 1273]

party. Adickes v.S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144 , 157-58, 90 S.Ct. 1598 , 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970) ; Jackson v . BellSouth
Telecomms ., 372 F.3d 1250 , 1280 (11th Cir. 2004). Upon doing so, the court must determine whether a rational jury could
find for the non-moving party. Anderson v . Liberty Lobby , Inc ., 477 U.S. 242 , 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)
. Amovant ""must show that, on all the essential elements of its case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial, no
reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party."" U. S.v. Four Parcels of Real Prop ., 941 F.2d 1428 , 1438 (11th Cir.
1991). When the non-moving party has the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only show ""that there is an
absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case."" Celotex Corp ., 477 U.S. at 325 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 . Where

reasonable minds could differ on the inferences arising from undisputed facts, a court should deny summary judgment. Allen
121 F.3d at 646 .

ANALYSIS
The Court will address Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment first, followed by Plaintiffs' Motion.
|. Defendants' Second Motion for Summary Judgment
Defendants' raise three arguments in their Second Motion: (1) Plaintiffs do not own a valid copyright; (2) if Plaintiffs do
own a copyright, it does not encompass the book cover art displayed in Defendants’ book; and (3) Defendants’ publication of
the Death Dealer artworks is permitted by prior agreement. Dkt. 111 at 4-9. The Court will address these points in order.

A. Plaintiffs' Copyright Ownership

To succeed on a claim of direct copyright infringement, a plaintiff must first show ownership of a valid copyright. Feist
Publ'ns ., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., Inc ., 499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) . Defendants
assert that the registrations provided are inadequate because they are uncertified and dated years after first publication. Dkt.
111 at 5.

17 U.S.C. § 410 provides that:

In any judicial proceedings the certificate of a registration made before or within five years after first publication of
the work shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the
certificate. The evidentiary weight to be accorded the certificate of a registration made thereafter shall be within
the discretion of the court.

17 U.S.C. § 410(c). ""[I]t is well-settled that ownership of the copyright is demonstrated through compliance with the
formalities of registration,"" particularly when the opposing party offers no contradictory evidence. Lifetime Homes, Inc.v.


--- Page 3 ---
Residential Development Corp ., 510 F. Supp. 2d 794 , 801 (M.D. Fla. 2007) (citing Donald Frederick Evans & Assoc ., Inc.
v. Cont'l Homes, Inc ., 785 F.2d 897 , 903 (11th Cir. 1986)). Additionally, a court may judicially notice U.S. Copyright Office
records under Federal Rule of Evidence 201. See, e. g., Brandon v. Warner Bros . Records , No. 15-22738-ClV-
WILLIAMS, 2015 WL 13264190, at *1 n.1 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 15, 2015).

Plaintiffs submitted exhibits purporting to be the registration certificates for Death Dealer Il and V. Dkt. 79-1 at 3-6.
According to those certificates, Death Dealer II was first published in 1988, and its copyright was registered in 2009. Dkt. 79-
1 at 3. Death Dealer V was first published in 1990 and the copyright registered in 2009. /d. at 5. Frazetta Properties, LLC
owns both registrations. /d. at 3-6. Because the registrations are dated more than five

[716 F.Supp.3d 1274]
years after first publication, the Court has discretion as to their weight. 17 U.S.C. § 410(c).

The copyright registration numbers in the Complaint, Dkt. 1 at 2, and Plaintiffs’ exhibits, Dkt. 79-1 at 3-6, are verifiable
through the U.S. Copyright Office's public catalogue. Public Catalogue, https://cocatalog.loc.gov/ (input registration number
in basic search field). By submitting the registration numbers and certificates, Plaintiffs put forth adequate evidence that
Frazetta Properties has a valid copyright ownership in the Death Dealer II and V artwork.

Defendants charge that the copyrights are ""invalid and/or unenforceable"" due to ""defects in the registration and/or fraud
on the Copyright Office."" Dkt. 107 at 11. ""In order to establish fraud on the Copyright Office, defendants must show that the
omission or misrepresentation by plaintiff was ‘intentional or purposeful concealment of relevant information.'"" Home Design
Srvs ., Inc. v. David Weekley Homes , LLC, 548 F. Supp. 2d 1306 , 1311 (M.D. Fla. 2008) (quoting Original Appalachian
Artworks , Inc. v. Toy Loft , Inc ., 684 F.2d 821 , 828 (11th Cir. 1982)). As Defendants bear the burden of proof on this claim
at trial, they ""must show that, on all the essential elements . . . no reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party."" Four
Parcels of Real Prop ., 941 F.2d at 1438 . But Defendants provide no factual basis or supporting evidence for their charges
of defective registration or fraud. Dkt. 107 at 11; see also Dkt. 79 at 5. A reasonable jury would therefore certainly find for
Plaintiffs on Defendants' invalid registration claim.

Other than their unsupported allegations of fraudulent or defective registration, Defendants have offered no evidence to
counter Frazetta Properties’ proof of registration. However, Defendants are correct that Holly Frazetta and Heidi Frazetta
have not established copyright ownership. Dkt. 107 at 11. Plaintiffs’ own evidence—the registration certificates and numbers
—suggests that the copyright is owned solely by Frazetta Properties. Plaintiffs have not put forth sufficient evidence (or any
evidence) showing that Holly and Heidi Frazetta own the relevant copyrights. Thus, Defendants' Motion for Summary
Judgment is granted only as to Holly and Heidi Frazetta. As to Frazetta Properties’ copyright ownership, the Motion is
denied.

B. If Frazetta Properties' Copyright Encompasses the Book Cover Art

Defendants next assert that, if Plaintiffs do own a copyright, that copyright does not encompass the two book covers.
They first argue that Frazetta Properties owns the copyright to a derivative work. Dkt. 111 at 6. They also suggest that the
Death Dealer book cover art is itself a derivative that only ""incorporate[es] some portion"" of the original work. /d. The
undisputed facts belie both these theories.

i. Frazetta Properties Owns Copyright to the Original Death Dealer Works

First, the copyrights owned by Frazetta Properties were registered in 2009 but correspond to works first published in
1988 and 1990. Dkt. 79-1 at 3-6. The relevant Death Dealer books were also first published in 1988 and 1990, and the
inside covers of those books show that Frank Frazetta retained a copyright in the artwork used for the cover. Dkt. 79-1 at 3-
6; Dkt. 100-1 at 25-28. The reasonable inference is that the Death Dealer artwork and the book cover art is the same work,
for which Frazetta Properties owns a copyright.

Defendants make much of the fact that Frazetta Properties’ copyright was not

[716 F.Supp.3d 1275]

registered until 2009. Dkt. 111 at 6. But a copyright may be registered at any time during its lifespan. Arthur Rutenberg
Homes , Inc. v. Drew Homes, Inc ., 29 F.3d 1529 , 1531 (11th Cir. 1994) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 408). The 2009 date of
registration in no way indicates that Frazetta Properties owns copyright of a derivative work, rather than the original.
Defendants' first argument is unconvincing.

ii. Whether the Death Dealer Book Cover Art is a Derivative Is Immaterial

Defendants' second argument does not fair better. This theory is that the Death Dealer book covers merely
""incorporate some portion, of some version"" of Death Dealer II and V artwork. Dkt. 111 at 6. But the Court denies summary
judgment on this point for two reasons: (1) a rational jury might find that the book cover art is a copy, not a derivative; and (2)
even if the book cover art is a derivative, Frazetta Properties could bring an infringement claim based on material that exists
in the earlier, registered work.


--- Page 4 ---
Defendants posit that comparisons of the original art (as depicted in the instant Complaint) and the book covers
demonstrate significant differences. Dkt. 107 at 11. Attachments to Mr. Spurlock's affidavit (Dkt. 87) show the works side-by-
side. It is uncontested that the book cover art is smaller than the original Death Dealer II artwork, and that the book cover
image has been slightly cropped. Dkt. 87-4.

The differences between the Death Dealer V original artwork and the book cover incorporating it are also not
contested: (1) brighter coloring; (2) a figure at the bottom edge of the frame is missing a helmet; (3) the Death Dealer's
armor has different plates; (4) the walls have more

[716 F.Supp.3d 1276]
defined stone; (5) the Death Dealer's leg is at a different angle; (6) some cropping; and (7) the lighting is different. Dkt. 87-5.

A derivative work is "" '[a] work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications [to a
preexisting work that], as a whole, represent an original work of authorship.'"" Montgomery v . Noga_.. 168 F.3d 1282 , 1290
(11th Cir. 1999) (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 101) (alterations in original). A ""non-infringing and sufficiently original"" derivative work
""qualifies for a separate copyright."" /d. But only the original elements of a derivative work are protected by its copyright—
preexisting material is not covered. /d . And while the originality requirement is ""slight,"" a creator must make more than a
minimal contribution. /d .; Compendium of U.S . Copyright Office Practices § 907.1 (2021)
https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap900/ch900-visual-art.pdf.

The line between slight originality and minimal contribution can be difficult to draw. See Latimer v . Roaring Toyz, Inc.,
601 F.3d 1224 , 1235 (11th Cir. 2010). Modifications that make a work derivative will impact the ""artistic look and feel
overall."" Olem Shoe Corp .v. Wash. Shoe Co., No. 09-23494-ClV, 2011 WL 6202282, at *12 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 1, 2011);see
also Davidsonv.U.S., 138 Fed. Cl. 159, 170-71 (Fed. Cl. 2018) (artist gave derivative of Statute of Liberty a ""softer and
more feminine"" appearance by modeling its ""fresh"" face after a photograph of his mother-in-law); Eden Toys, Inc.v.
Florelee Undergarment Co ., 697 F.2d 27 , 34-35 (2d Cir. 1982) (drawing was a derivative because the modifications

[716 F.Supp.3d 1277]
gave the work ""a different, cleaner ‘look’ than"" the original).

Originality is usually a question of fact. Home Legend , LLC v . Mannington Mills , Inc ., 784 F.3d 1404 , 1409 (11th Cir.
2015); see also Montgomery. 168 F.3d at 1290 n.12. However, originality can be determined as a matter of law if the
uncontested facts show that the creator of a derivative ""merely copied"" a former work, ""adding nothing original"" and having
the ""earlier work in mind."" Home Legend , LLC , 784 F.3d at 1410 (citing Meshwerks Inc . v. Toyota Motor Sales U.S .A.,
Inc ., 528 F.3d 1258 , 1264-65 (10th Cir. 2008)). Here, summary judgment is denied for Defendants because a rational jury
could reasonably find that the Death Dealer book covers lack sufficient originality to qualify for a derivative copyright.
Indeed, this does appear close to a case of mere copying.

The Court also denies summary judgment for Defendants because, even if the book covers were derivatives, Frazetta
Properties could pursue an infringement claim based on the preexisting material derived from their earlier, copyright-
protected original Death Dealer II and V artworks.

When a copyright owner produces an unregistered derivative and that derivative is copied, the owner can bring an
infringement claim based on the preexisting material that came from the earlier, registered work. Montgomery_. 168 F.3d at
1292 . In Montgomery , the Eleventh Circuit held that the defendants infringed by copying a derivative computer program,
even though the derivative program was unregistered. /d . The infringement claim was based not on the unregistered
derivative, but on the earlier, registered work. The claim was successful because the derivative program incorporated over



--- Page 5 ---
70% of the source code from the copyright-registered work. /d.

Here, Defendants do not contest that Mr. Frazetta produced both the original Death Dealer artworks and the book
cover art. And the undisputed evidence shows that the book cover art incorporates far more than 70% of preexisting
material from the original Death Dealer II and V artworks. Compare Dkt. 1 4 37 to Dkt. 67-1 at 68, 71. As a result, even if a
jury found that the book covers were derivative works, Frazetta Properties could bring a successful infringement claim based
on the copyright registration it does own. Defendants' Second Motion for Summary Judgment is denied as to this claim.

C. The 2010 License Agreement

Finally, Defendants ask the Court to rule that their use of the Death Dealer cover art is protected by a prior licensing
agreement, ""Frazetta Endorsement & Trademark License Agreement"" (""2010 Agreement""). Dkt. 111 at 7-8. But the Court
cannot so rule.

The 2010 Agreement, in relevant part, grants Defendant Vanguard Publishing a license for:

One (1) book entitled ""The Definitive Frazetta Reference"" by James Bond and David Winiewicz, Ph.D. (which has
been previously published by Licensee). No royalties or sales reports are due Licensor or the artist Frank
Frazetta on this title. Licensee has the right to update, revise text, replace images, re-design and publish this
FRAZETTA Book as Licensee sees fit.

Dkt. 87-2 at 18; Dkt. 111 at 8. The interpretation of copyright licensing agreements, as with other contracts, is a question of
state law. Ferox , LLC v. ConSeal Int'l, Inc ., 175 F. Supp. 3d 1363, 1370 (S.D. Fla. 2016) (citing Utopia Provider Sys .,

[716 F.Supp.3d 1278]

Inc. v. Pro-Med Clinical Sys.,L.L.C ., 596 F.3d 1313 , 1328 (11th Cir. 2010)). Under Florida law, ""[t]he cardinal rule of
contractual interpretation is that when the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract must be interpreted

and enforced in accordance with the plain meaning."" Advanzeon Sols ., Inc. v. State. 321 So. 3d 911 , 915 (Fla. 1st DCA
2021) (citation omitted).

The plain language of the 2010 Agreement states that Defendants have the right to publish The Definitive Frazetta
Reference , including the right to re-publish revised or re-designed editions of the book. Therefore, whether this license
covers Defendant's publication of Frazetta Book Cover Art depends on whether that title is a revised edition of The Definitive
Frazetta Reference . Because this is an affirmative defense, Defendants would bear the burden of proving thatFrazetta

Book Cover Artis a reprint or revision of The Definitive Frazetta Reference . In re Rawson Food Serv ., Inc ., 846 F.2d 1343 ,
1349 (11th Cir. 1988).

Defendants have not put forth evidence showing this. They entered Frazetta Book Cover Art and The Definitive
Frazetta Reference as exhibits (Dkts. 67-1, 102), but provided no other factual argument that the two are different versions
of the same book. A comparison of the two books supports the opposite conclusion. The two have different titles and
different authors. The Definitive Frazetta Reference takes a broad look at Mr. Frazetta's work, while Frazetta Book Cover Art
focuses (unsurprisingly) on book covers. Most notably, the copyright page of Frazetta Book Cover Artindicates that its first
printing was April 29, 2022. Dkt. 67-1 at 4. In contrast, The Definitive Frazetta Reference was first printed in 2008, with a
revised edition in 2010. On this evidence, a rational trier of fact could find that Frazetta Book Cover Artis an entirely different
book. Based on its plain language, the 2010 Agreement covers only The Definitive Frazetta Reference and subsequent
editions. Thus, Defendants’ argument for summary judgment fails. 1

Under a separate theory, Defendants argue that the 2010 Agreement should extend a license to publish the 2022
Frazetta Book Cover Artas a derivative of the 2008/2010 The Definitive Frazetta Reference . But license to use an original
work does not, on its own, confer license to produce derivatives of that work. See Andy Warhol Found . v . Goldsmith__598
U.S. 508 , 526, 143 S.Ct. 1258 , 215 L.Ed.2d 473 (2023) (describing right to reproduce an original and right to prepare
derivative work as distinct); see also 17 U.S.C. § 103 (granting owners of copyright exclusive rights to produce derivative
works).

The Court cannot rule as a matter of law that the 2010 Agreement confers a license to publish the Death Dealer
artwork in Defendants' 2022 Frazetta Book Cover Artbook. Defendants’ Motion is denied on this ground.

Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Defendant's Second Motion as to Heidi and Holly Frazetta's ownership of the
copyright registration for Death Dealer II and V. The rest of the Second Motion is denied.

Il. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment
Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, asking the Court to rule as a matter of law

[716 F.Supp.3d 1279]


--- Page 6 ---
on all Counts and each affirmative defense. Dkt. 79 at 10. Prior to the Court's ruling on the Motion, Defendants filed a
superseding Amended Answer (Dkt. 107). See Pintando v . Miami-Dade Housing Auth ., 501 F.3d 1241 , 1243 (11th Cir.
2007) (""As a general matter, an amended pleading supersedes the former pleading.""). The Amended Answer added
Defendants’ prior licensing agreement argument, but otherwise asserted the same defenses which Plaintiffs addressed in

their Motion for Summary Judgment. Compare Dkts. 14, 15 to Dkt. 107. As a result, the Court may consider Plaintiffs’ Motion

for Summary Judgment as if directed towards the Amended Answer. 2 See New York Life Ins. Co.v. Grant , 57 F. Supp. 3d
1401, 1409 (M.D. Ga. 2014).

Plaintiffs ask for summary judgment on all counts and affirmative defenses. The Court will address these in order.
A. Injunctive Relief

Count | requests injunctive relief. This is a remedy, not a separate cause of action. Exum v. Nat'l Tire and Battery , 437
F. Supp. 3d 1141, 1158-59 (S.D. Fla. 2020) (collecting cases). A court may dismiss a count sua sponte without notice if it is
""patently frivolous or if reversal would be futile."" Tazoe v. Airbus S.A. S., 631 F.3d 1321 , 1336 (11th Cir. 2011). As itis
""well-established that injunctive relief is not a proper claim for relief in and of itself,"" GlobalOptions Srvs ., Inc. v.N.Am.

Trng . Grp ., Inc ., 131 F. Supp. 3d 1291, 1302 (M.D. Fla. 2015), reversal of the dismissal would be futile, and the Court
dismisses Count I.

B. Direct Infringement

Count II alleges direct copyright infringement. Dkt. 1 9 83-90. To establish a prima facie case of direct infringement,
Plaintiffs must prove: ""(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are
original."" Feist, 499 U.S. at 361 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 . Plaintiffs put forth registration certificates that are verifiable through the
U.S. Copyright Office, and Defendants offered no evidence contesting that proof. As explained more fully in section I(A), no
rational juror could find that Plaintiffs failed to show Frazetta Properties’ copyright ownership.

To show copying, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the Death Dealer artwork and the incorporating book covers are ""
substantially similar."" Oravec v . Sunny Isles Luxury Ventures , Inc ., 527 F.3d 1218 , 1223 (11th Cir. 2008). Works are
substantially similar if ""an average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the
copyrighted work."" Id.

Defendants argue that ""[t]he Death Dealer images presented in Plaintiffs' Complaint differ significantly from the Death
Dealer Il and Death Dealer V images reproduced in Defendants’ Frazetta Definitive Reference."" Dkt. 107 at 11. But the
uncontested facts, drawn from Defendants’ exhibits, show otherwise. See supra § I(B). An average lay person, comparing

[716 F.Supp.3d 1280]

the images side-by-side, could not help but find the book cover art to be an appropriation of the Death Dealer II and V
original artworks. /d.

Because no reasonable jury could find for Defendants, the Court grants summary judgment for Frazetta Properties on
Count II as to artworks Death Dealer II and V. 3 Plaintiffs submitted no evidence that Defendants copied Death Dealer VI, so
summary judgment is denied as to that work.

C. Contributory and Vicarious Infringement and Inducement of Infringement

Counts Ill, IV, and V allege contributory infringement, vicarious infringement, and inducement of infringement. Dkt. 1 94
91-115. ""One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement and infringes vicariously by
profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it."" Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc .v.
Grokster , Ltd .. 545 U.S. 913 , 930, 125 S.Ct. 2764 , 162 L.Ed.2d 781 (2005) . One induces infringement by ""distribut[ing] a
device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright."" /d. at 936-37, 125 S.Ct. 2764 . Plaintiffs allege that they are
""continuing to investigate the possible involvement of unknown third parties, including illustrators, publishers, printers, co-
writers and ghostwriters,"" Dkt. 1 § 43, and that Defendants ""induce[d] others"" to infringe Plaintiffs’ copyright, id. 112. But
they allege no specific facts and do not put forth any evidence in support of these claims.

""One of the principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims
or defenses[.]"" Celotex. 477 U.S. at 323-24 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 . ""After adequate time for discovery,"" id. at 323, 106 S.Ct.
2548 , Plaintiffs have failed to factually support Counts III, IV, and V. Their Motion for Summary Judgment on these Counts
is denied.

D . Affirmative Defenses

Plaintiffs additionally seek summary judgment on Defendants’ eleven affirmative defenses. The majority of the
""affirmative defenses"" attack Plaintiffs’ prima facie case, rather than stating a reason that the Court should rule for
Defendants even if Plaintiffs establish their case by a preponderance of the evidence. See Wright v . Southland Corp ., 187
F.3d 1287 , 1303 (11th Cir. 1999); /n re Rawson Food Serv .., Inc ., 846 F.2d at 1349 (""A defense which points out a defect in


--- Page 7 ---
the plaintiff's prima facie case is not an affirmative defense.""). The Court has already discussed the majority of the so-called
""affirmative defenses"" above. Holly and Heidi Frazetta's standing, Frazetta Properties’ copyright ownership, whether the
book covers copied the original Death Dealer artworks, and the validity of Frazetta Properties’ copyright registration all go to
Plaintiff's prima facie case. 4

[716 F.Supp.3d 1281]

The Court has also discussed Defendants' arguments surrounding the 2010 Agreement at length above. See supra §
\(C). The existence of a relevant licensing agreement is an affirmative defense on which Defendants would bear the burden
of proof at trial. As a result, Plaintiffs can prevail on summary judgment by showing that there is an absence of evidence to

support the affirmative defense. Celotex Corp ., 477 U.S. at 325 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 . As noted in Section I(C), Defendants did
not put forth any real evidence showing that Frazetta Book Cover Art (the allegedly infringing work) is a revised edition of
The Definitive Frazetta Reference (the work covered by the 2010 Agreement). And no rational jury could find such.
Defendants' attempt to show that Frazetta Book Cover Artis allowed by prior agreement is exactly the type of factually

unsupported argument that should be disposed of through summary judgment. See Celotex._477 U.S. at 323-24 , 106 S.Ct.
2548 . The Court grants summary judgment for Plaintiffs on Defendants' defense of prior license (Dkt. 107 at 12).

E. Fair Use

The remaining affirmative defense is fair use. Defendants assert that their publication of the book cover art ""was a
legally protected fair use"" under Section 107 of the Copyright Act. Dkt. 107 at 11. The parties agree that there are no
genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment on this issue, so the Court may rule as a matter of law. Dkt. 79
at 10; Dkt. 80; Dkt. 67 at 11.

Fair use balances the two goals of copyright law: incentivizing creativity and promoting scientific and artistic progress.
Andy Warhol Found ., 598 U.S. at 528 , 143 S.Ct. 1258 . The doctrine requires courts to balance four factors:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
17 U.S.C. § 107. No one factor is dispositive, and the inquiry is not ""a mechanical ‘add up the factors' approach."" Cambridge
Univ . Press v . Patton 769 F.3d 1232 , 1260 (11th Cir. 2014). Indeed, ""the four statutory fair use factors may not 'be treated
in isolation, one from another. All are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.’

"" Andy Warhol Found ., 598 U.S. at 550-51 , 143 S.Ct. 1258 (quoting Campbell v . Acuff-Rose Music , Inc ., 510 U.S. 569 ,
578, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ). In this case, the factors weigh against a finding of fair use.

i. Purpose and Character

This first factor asks whether the secondary use of the copyrighted work ""has a further purpose or different character,""
i.e., if it is transformative. Andy Warhol Found ., 598 U.S. at 525 , 143 S.Ct. 1258 . This inquiry is not a yes/no question;
instead, it is a ""matter of degree,"" asking not only ""whether,"" but also ""to what extent"" the purpose or character of the
secondary use is different. /d. at 529,143 S.Ct. 1258 . The ""central question"" is ""whether the new work merely supersedes
the objects of the original creation (‘supplanting' the original)."" /d . at 528,143 S.Ct. 1258 (cleaned up). A use that ""serve[s]
as a substitute for the original or its plausible derivatives"" is less likely to be

[716 F.Supp.3d 1282]

fair use than one that ""has a distinct purpose."" /d. at 531,143 S.Ct. 1258 . Commercial uses are also less likely to be fair./d

Defendants rely on the Second Circuit's decision in Bill Graham Archives v . Dorling Kindersley Ltd . to argue that their
use of the Death Dealer II and V artworks was transformative. Bill Graham addressed the unlicensed use of seven images

included in a coffee table book about the Grateful Dead. Bill Graham Archives v . Dorling Kindersley Ltd ., 448 F.3d 605 ,
607 (2d Cir. 2006). The Second Circuit explained that a ""typical page of the book features a collage of images, text, and

graphic art designed to simultaneously catch the eye and inform the reader."" Id. The images were reproduced in a small
size that was ""inadequate to offer more than a glimpse of their expressive value."" /d. at 611. They were included ""only to
enrich the presentation"" in combination with ""a prominent timeline, textual material, and original graphical artwork."" /d. And
finally, the images represented ""an inconsequential portion"" of the book as a whole. 5/d. For these reasons, the Bill Graham
court found their use transformative. /d.

Defendants argue that the same analysis applies here. They allege that Frazetta Book Cover Art""contains numerous


--- Page 8 ---
pages of text and graphics, captions with descriptions, commentary, historical information, and quotes"" with a purpose that is
""clearly for use as a biographic and reference resource."" Dkt. 67 § 55. But the book itself, entered into evidence by
Defendants, belies this description. While the copyrighted images make up a small percentage of Defendants’ overall book,
this alone cannot make their use transformative. Defendants’ book does not integrate the copyrighted works with other text,
artwork, and content. See Dkt. 67-1. Instead, the two individual book covers take up almost an entire page each, only
sharing space with short captions done in small, non-obtrusive font. /d. at 68, 71. The images at issue here are not so
minimal that they offer only ""a glimpse of their expressive value."" See Bill Graham__448 F.3d at 611 . To the contrary, the
Death Dealer II and V artworks are the primary focus of their respective pages in a large coffee table book. Dkt. 67-1 at 68,
71. The Bill Graham images ""enhance[d] the reader's understanding of the biographical text."" Bill Graham__448 F.3d at 609-
10 . But in the instant case, the images aren't used to enhance the text; rather, they are the sole focus of each page.

[716 F.Supp.3d 1283]
Image materials not available for display.
Dkt. 67-1 at 68, 71.

Defendants labeled Frazetta Book Cover Arta biography. Dkt. 67 at 18. But under the first factor, educational purpose
is not dispositive and must be weighed alongside other characteristics. See Andy Warhol Found ., 598 U.S. at 531 n.6, 143
S.Ct. 1258 ; Cambridge Univ . Press_, 769 F.3d at 1262-64 . Additionally, Defendants’ book relays little in the way of
education. The small accompanying captions tell only the title of the book, the date of publication, and the author. Dkt. 67-1
at 68, 71.

Thus, while Defendants’ use of the images may have some different purpose than the original artwork, the degree of
difference is small. In displaying the Death Dealer book covers, Defendants’ primary purpose is to showcase the Death
Dealer II and V artworks. This use supplants the object of the protected work and is therefore not transformative to any
meaningful extent.

Defendants’ use of Death Dealer V on the cover of Frazetta Book Cover Artis also not transformative. The Frazetta
Book Cover Artcover uses Death Dealer V in a collage, and its small size offers a correspondingly smaller glimpse of its
expressive value. Dkt. 67-1 at 1. But as a part of Frazetta Book Cover Art's front cover, Death Dealer V is being used
commercially to advertise Defendants' book. See Harper & Row Publishers , Inc. v. Nation Enters ., 471 U.S. 539 , 562, 105
S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) ; Latimer v . Roaring Toyz , Inc ., 2010 WL 3747148, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 21, 2010)
(images displayed inside magazine were ""not intended to increase the sale of the magazine""). While commercial use is not
dispositive, copying for commercial purposes is less likely to be fair use. Andy Warhol Found ., 598 U.S. at 531 , 143 S.Ct.
1258 . Overall, this first factor weighs against a finding of fair use.

ii. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second factor ""calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than
others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the

[716 F.Supp.3d 1284]

former works are copied."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Specifically, copying of ""works that are highly
creative"" is less likely to be fair use. Cambridge Univ . Press__769 F.3d at 1268 . This is so because ""[w]orks of fiction or

fantasy"" contain ""the most originality and inventiveness."" /d. Here, Death Dealer II and V are the type of highly creative,
original, and inventive work of fantasy that is most protected by copyright law. This factor weighs against a finding of fair
use.

iii. Amount and Substantiality Used

""A taking may not be excused merely because it is insubstantial with respect to the infringing work."" Harper & Row
Publishers , Inc ., 471 U.S. at 565 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (emphasis in original). Instead, a court should ""examine the amount and
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole."" Id. at 564, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (emphasis
added). However, this factor weighs less when applied to certain visual works ""where all or most of the work often must be
used in order to preserve any meaning at all,"" as compared to ""a work such as a text or musical composition, where bits and
pieces can be excerpted without losing all value."" Katz v. Google , Inc ., 802 F.3d 1178 , 1183-84 (11th Cir. 2015) (citation
omitted).

In the instant case, Defendants used the entire portion of Death Dealer II and V in their allegedly infringing book.
However, the nature of Defendants' use—featuring an image of the book covers in a compendium of Mr. Frazetta's book
cover art—would make it difficult to use just bits and pieces without losing all value. As a result, this factor is neutral.

iv. Market Effects

The final factor is a two-part inquiry into: ""(1) the extent of the market harm caused by the particular actions of the
alleged infringer, and (2) whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant would result


--- Page 9 ---
in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market."" Cambridge Univ . Press__769 F.3d at 1275 (quotations omitted).
Courts ask whether the secondary use, ""if everybody did it"" would cause substantial economic harm, reducing the incentive
to create. /d. at 1276. The market effects factor is related to the purpose and character inquiry. The less transformative the
use, the more likely it ""will serve as a substitute for the original or its plausible derivatives, shrinking the protected market
opportunities of the copyrighted work."" Andy Warhol Found ., 598 U.S. at 531 , 143 S.Ct. 1258 (quotation omitted).

This fourth factor weighs against a finding of fair use for the same reason that the first factor does: Defendants’ use of
the protected works supplants the purposes of the original. Defendants published a coffee table book in which Death Dealer
ll and V take up almost an entire page each. Plaintiffs currently market a coffee table book, in which Mr. Frazetta's art is
reproduced one image per page. Dkt. 83-1 at 7. Defendants argue that their infringing use did not cause Plaintiffs market
harm because Plaintiffs are still selling their books for hundreds of dollars each. Dkt. 83 at 1-2. But this ignores the second
half of the market-harm inquiry: if ""everybody"" engaged in conduct like Defendants’, the market would be overrun with
substitutes, and the incentive to create would be impaired.

The issue of supplanting is why Defendants' citation to Warren Pub . Co.v. Spurlock is inapposite. In Warren , the
copyright owner ""exhibited virtually no interest at all in utilizing his copyrights."" Warren Pub. Co. v . Spurlock. 645 F. Supp.
2d. 402 , 426 (E.D. Penn. 2009). Here, Plaintiffs operate a robust business selling coffee table

[716 F.Supp.3d 1285]

books, art prints, and other merchandise featuring Death Dealer Il and V. Dkt. 83 at 2. Even in Warren, where the plaintiff
had neglected his copyrights, the court found the market effects factor weighed slightly against fair use. Warren Pub. Co.,

645 F. Supp. 2d at 428 . Given the facts here, this ""most important"" factor weighs against fair use.See Harper & Row Pubs
., 471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 .

Three of the four fair use factors weigh against fair use, and the third is neutral. Defendants' use of Death Dealer II and
V was not fair use.

CONCLUSION

The uncontested evidence shows that Defendants infringed Frazetta Properties’ copyright in Death Dealer II and V, and
that use of the protected work was not allowed by prior license or permitted by the fair use doctrine. The undisputed facts
also demonstrate that Heidi and Holly Frazetta do not own the copyrights for Death Dealer II and V. Plaintiffs failed to
support their claims of contributory and vicarious infringement, or their claim of inducement of infringement. And Plaintiffs'
request for injunctive relief is a remedy, not a separate cause of action. The parties submitted no argument or evidence as to
damages.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED and ADJUDGED :
(1) Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 79) is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART.

(2) Defendant's Second Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 111) is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-
PART.

(3) Plaintiffs Heidi Frazetta and Holly Frazetta are DISMISSED.
(4) Count | is DISMISSED.

(5) Defendants' first Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 67) and Defendants’ Motion to Strike (Dkt. 126) are
moot.

(6) The parties shall submit briefs on a final judgment. These briefs must discuss the remedies sought in the
Complaint at Dkt. 1 pages 24-26. This brief is due within twenty-one (21) days of the date of this order.

ORDER TO MEDIATE: In light of this Order, if the parties are still at an impasse, the parties must participate in a half-
day mediation (zoom is permissible) within sixty (60) days of the below date.

DONE AND ORDERED at Tampa, Florida, on February 9, 2024.

Both parties have had reasonable notice, as well as robust opportunities to fully brief each count and affirmative defense. See Burton v . City of Belle
Glade__178 F.3d 1175 , 1203-04 (11th Cir. 1999) (""But so long as the party against whom judgment will be entered is given sufficient advance notice and
has been afforded an adequate opportunity to demonstrate why summary judgment should not be granted, then granting summary judgment sua sponte


--- Page 10 ---
is entirely appropriate.""); see also Dkts. 79, 80, 87, 94, 95, 100, 111, 121, 122.
3. For reasons explained below, the Court will grant summary judgment for Frazetta Properties on each of Defendants’ affirmative defenses.

4. Defendants also stated that they ""did not receive a cease-and-desist letter prior to Plaintiffs’ commencement of suit."" Dkt. 107 at 13. This is neither
an affirmative defense nor an attack on Plaintiffs’ case. 17 U.S.C. § 411 requires plaintiffs to register or preregister their copyrights prior to filing suit for
infringement but says nothing about a cease-and-desist. 17 U.S.C. § 411(a); see also Fourth Est. Pub. Benefit Corp . v . Wall-Street . com , LLC__586
U.S. 296 , 139 S.Ct. 881 , 887, 203 L.Ed.2d 147 (2019) (describing registration as akin to administrative exhaustion).

5. This characteristic is useful for determining if a work is transformative but should not be confused with the third factor (amount and substantiality
of the copyrighted work used). See Bill Graham__448 F.3d at 611 .

ORDER
Lewis A. Kaplan, United States District Judge
This matter is before the Court on defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiff's second
[399 F.Supp.3d 174]
amended complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. +

Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger has rendered a well considered report and recommendation in which he
recommends that defendants' motion be GRANTED to the extent it bars the recovery of damages for any infringement
occurring prior to March 13, 2015 and DENIED in all other respects. 2

Defendants raise three principal objections to Judge Lehrburger's recommendations. They argue that Judge Lehrburger
should have concluded that: (1) the works in question are not substantially similar; (2) defendants’ use qualifies as a fair use;
and (3) plaintiff is not entitled to an award of statutory damages or attorneys fees. 3

Defendants' first two objections are without merit and are overruled.

With regard to defendants’ third objection, Section 412 of the Copyright Act imposes a bright-line rule barring the recovery of
statutory damages and attorneys fees for infringement occurring after registration if that infringement is part of an ongoing
series of infringing acts and the first act occurred before registration. See Steele v. Bell, 2014 WL1979227 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) ;
Shady Records, Inc. v. Source Enterprises, Inc. , 2005 WL 14920 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). The Court has carefully reviewed this
matter and determined that because defendants' first alleged infringement occurred in 2013—four years before plaintiff
registered the work in question—application of the bright-line rule precluding the award of statutory damages and attorneys
fees is appropriate in this case.

Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss the second amended complaint [DI 51] is granted to the extent that plaintiff's
claims for statutory damages, attorneys fees, and damages for any infringement occurring prior to March 13, 2015 are
dismissed. It is denied in all other respects.

SO ORDERED.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON MOTION TO DISMISS

ROBERT W. LEHRBURGER, United States Magistrate Judge

TO THE HONORABLE LEWIS A. KAPLAN, United States District Judge:

This case is about whether the phrase ""We Run Things, Things Don't Run We"" used in the chart-topping 2013 song ""We
Can't Stop"" co-written and performed by Miley Cyrus infringes Michael May's copyright in his hit 1988 song ""We Run
Things."" Cyrus and her co-defendants have moved to dismiss May's complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Alternatively, Defendants seek a ruling that even if May has a viable claim, he
cannot recover statutory damages or attorneys’ fees, and his damages are limited by the applicable three-year statute of
limitations. For the reasons set forth below, | recommend that Defendants' motion to dismiss be DENIED with respect to
infringement, fair use, statutory damages and attorney's fees and GRANTED with respect to limiting pre-suit damages to a
three-year period.

Factual Background +
A. May and ""We Run Things""

May, also known as Flourgon, is a Jamaican songwriter and recording artist
[399 F.Supp.3d 175]

who released hit reggae singles in the late 1980s and 1990s. 2In the 1980s, May performed as a disc jockey and created his
own sound system sets and authored his own lyrics. 2At the start of that period, in or about 1981, May created, originated


--- Page 2 ---
and authored ""We run things. Things no run we"" as a lyrical phrase included in his performances (the ""Phrase""). 4 Several
former sound system colleagues or associates of May assert that May originated the Phrase and that none of them were
aware of the Phrase being previously used. 5

The Phrase is a combination of English language and Jamaican Patois dialect. Phonetically, in strict Patois, the Phrase
would be ""Wi run tings. Tings nuh run wi."" &The SAC is ambiguous as to whether May merely adapted the Phrase ""We run
things. Things no run we"" from the Jamaican Patios saying ""Wi run tings. Tings nuh run wi,"" or whether May originated the
Phrase from whole cloth. 2 At oral argument, however, May's counsel expressly rejected conceding the notion that May
adapted the Phrase from a pre-existing strict Patois version of the same phrasing. &

In 1988, May incorporated the Phrase into a song entitled We Run Things. 2The Phrase appears nine times in the song,
particularly in the repeated chorus. 12 May's song was publicly released in 1988, became a No. 1 hit in Jamaica, and
garnered ""great acclaim"" outside Jamaica, including in the United States. 11In 1999, May ""permitted"" We Run Things to be
used in the soundtrack of a Jamaican action-crime film. 12May registered We Run Things with the United States Copyright

[399 F.Supp.3d 176]
Office in 2017, shortly before filing this lawsuit. 18

May alleges that the theme of the Phrase and We Run Things is ""an attitude of personal freedom and situational control,
where an individual need not be constrained by fear or reproach as he/she is not controlled or ruled by one's
circumstances."" 14The lyrics of We Run Things , attached at the end of this opinion, celebrate personal freedom and control,
mostly over money, other men and particularly women. Two such examples are:

We rule girl, girl no rule we That's a fi girl, dem haffi respect we

But if a girl love me, that's a different fashion Jahman she would haffi know she mi a di man We come first and
she come second

The phrase ""We rule girl, girl no rule we"" is repeated three times throughout We Run Things.

B. Cyrus and ""We Can't Stop""

Miley Cyrus is a popular and successful American singer and songwriter. 15 Cyrus co-wrote the song We Can't Stop , which
was released in 2013 and achieved ""meteoric success."" 1° We Can't Stop was re-released each year thereafter to the
present. 12 Cyrus's song celebrates female empowerment and includes lyrics such as ""This is our house; this is our rules"";
""Can't you see it's we who own the night""; ""It's our party we can do what we want; ""It's our party we can say what we want;
It's our party we can love who we want""; ""We can kiss who we want."" 18 The lyric ""We run things, things don't run we""
appears three times in the song, each time in the chorus.

Cyrus has looked to multiple genres of music, including Caribbean music, to inspire her own work. 121In a 2015 interview,
Defendants Theron and Timothy Thomas, songwriters and producers, and co-authors of We Can't Stop , explained that they
incorporate Caribbean culture and melodies into their songs; and, in regard to We Can't Stop , mentioned ""We run tings,
tings don't run we"" and ""Hands inna di air like we don't care"" as examples. 22

Cyrus and the other defendants are music industry professionals who are familiar with established industry practice,
including licensing of song rights. 24 According to the SAC, the Defendants knew or should have known that they needed to

clear the rights to use the Phrase just as they cleared rights to use another song's phrase — ""La Di Da Di"" — for We Can't
Stop. 22

We Can't Stop has been a ""worldwide commercial success."" 22 The song was Cyrus's
[399 F.Supp.3d 177]

""comeback"" single with over five million copies sold. 24 The song's music video release set record-breaking numbers in
viewing, and Cyrus continues to perform the song in her concerts and promotional appearances. 2°

C. May's Copyright Infringement Claim

May's SAC asserts a single count of copyright infringement. The SAC repeatedly bases that claim on We Can't Stop 's
incorporation of the Phrase, 22and specifically compares the extent and nature of use of the Phrase in We Run Things and
We Can't Stop. 22 May's ""Lyrical Phrase Comparison"" chart asserts that the Phrase is used nine times in May's song and
also in the title of the song and in the hook of the repeated chorus, while Cyrus's song uses the Phrase three times in the
hook of its repeated chorus. 28 We Can't Stop repeatedly uses ""substantially similar phraseology"" by using the literal English
translation of the Phrase ""while wholly maintaining the unique Patois phraseology."" 22 The SAC also alleges that We Can't
Stop employs the Phrase to convey the same theme as We Run Things , 22and also uses substantially the same ""vocal
melody/cadence/rhythm/inflection."" 34 The SAC does not, however, allege that We Can't Stop as a whole work infringes We


--- Page 3 ---
Run Things as a whole work. May seeks injunctive relief, damages, attorney's fees and costs pursuant to the Copyright Act.

D. History Of The Phrase Apart From The Parties' Songs 22

Various articles and literature indicate that the Phrase, or some variation of it, has a lengthy history and is well-recognized in
Jamaican culture. For instance, ""Wi run tings, tings nuh run we"" is included in an online source of ""Wise Jamaican
Proverbs."" 22 Similarly, a 2003 publication refers to "" ‘we run tings, tings nuh run we"" as an “old Jamaican proverb."" 24""Wi run
tings, tings nuh run wi"" also is defined in an online dictionary of Jamaican Patois. 25 And an article from a Jamaican news
publication suggests that even May's attorneys recognize that the Phrase, at some point, became ""commonly used"" and ""a
part of Jamaican culture."" 36 It is not clear how far

[399 F.Supp.3d 178]

back use of the Phrase or its variations go, but there is no dispute that the Phrase was widely accessible from multiple
sources prior to the release of We Can't Stop in 2013.

E. Defendants' Motion To Dismiss

Defendants advance three primary arguments in support of their motion to dismiss on the merits. First, although the song
We Run Things is copyrighted, the Phrase alone is not subject to copyright protection. Second, even if the Phrase were
protectable, that protection is minimal, and there is no substantial similarity between the works. Third, Defendants use of the
Phrase in We Can't Stop is a permissible fair use under the Copyright Act.

In addition to addressing the merits issues, Defendants also move to dismiss certain aspects of damages sought by May.
Specifically, Defendants argue that May is not entitled to damages for any time prior to the three-year statute of limitations
period preceding filing of this action. Defendants further contend that May is not entitled to statutory damages or attorneys'

fees because he did not register We Run Things until 2017, several years after We Can't Stop was first released in 2013.

As explained below, the standards governing a motion to dismiss, which require that reasonable inferences be drawn in
favor of the non-moving party, compel denial of Defendants' motion. Defendants' arguments to a large extent are predicated
on an incorrect assumption that the Phrase merely is a trivial adaptation of a well-known, pre-existing Jamaican saying.
While that ultimately may prove to be true, the Court cannot make that determination on this motion. Further, the Court
cannot conclude without a more developed record that Defendants’ use of the Phrase is a fair use, although that too may
well turn out to be so. As to damages, the Court, and the parties, agree that May, if successful, cannot recover damages for
any time prior to the three-year statutory period preceding filing of his complaint. Whether May could recover statutory
damages and attorney's fees, however, is premature to answer at this stage of the case.

Procedural History

May filed his initial complaint on March 13, 2018. He filed the operative Second Amended Complaint on June 5, 2018. The
SAC alleges a single cause of action for copyright infringement and seeks injunctive relief as well as damages, attorneys’
ees and costs. The Defendants filed the motion to dismiss on August 22, 2018. Following full briefing, this Court heard
argument on January 8, 2019.

Legal Principles

A. Motion To Dismiss Standards

To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
ace."" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly . 550 U.S. 544 , 570,127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) . A claim is facially
plausible when the factual content pleaded allows a court ""to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for
he misconduct alleged."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) . ""Where a
complaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a defendant's liability, it ‘stops short of the line between possibility
and plausibility of entitlement to relief.’"" /d. (quoting Twombly. 550 U.S. at 557 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 ).

In considering a motion to dismiss, a district court must ""accept ] all factual claims in the complaint as true, and draw| ] all
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.""

[399 F.Supp.3d 179]

Lotes Co. v. Hon Hai Precision Indus. Co. , 753 F.3d 395 , 403 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). However,
this tenet is ""inapplicable to legal conclusions."" /qbal__ 556 U.S. at 678 , 129 S.Ct. 1937 . ""Threadbare recitals of the
elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice."" /d. ""[RJather, the complaint's
[flactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, i.e. , enough to make the claim
plausible."" Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110 , 120 (2d Cir. 2010) (quotation marks omitted). A complaint is
properly dismissed where, as a matter of law, ""the allegations in [the] complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of
entitlement to relief."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 .

For the purposes of considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to 12(b)(6), a court generally is confined to the facts alleged in


--- Page 4 ---
the complaint._Cortec Industries v. Sum Holding L.P. , 949 F.2d 42 , 47 (2d Cir. 1991). A court may, however, consider
documents attached to the complaint, statements or documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, matters of
which judicial notice may be taken, public records, and documents that the plaintiff either possessed or knew about, and
relied upon, in bringing the suit. See Kleinman v. Elan Corp. . 706 F.3d 145 , 152 (2d Cir. 2013) (citingATS/
Communications, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd. , 493 F.3d 87 , 98 (2d Cir. 2007) ).

allegations, control, and the court need not accept the allegations in the complaint as true."" Poindexter v. EMI Record Grp.

Nimmer, Nimmer On Copyright § 14—01[B] (2012) (hereinafter, ""Nimmer"") § 12.10).

B. Copyright Infringement Principles

Establishing copyright infringement requires proof of: ""(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent
elements of the work that are original."" Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct. 1282 ,
113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) . For purposes of this motion, Defendants accept as true the allegation that May owns a valid
copyright in the song We Run Things. (Def. Mem. at 2 n.1.) Accordingly, ownership and validity are not at issue on this
motion. Rather, the arguments focus on the second requirement: improper copying. See Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony Records,
351 F.3d 46 , 51 (2d Cir. 2003) (infringement entails copying that ""amounts to an improper or unlawful appropriation"").
Proving improper copying in turn requires establishing two elements: ""(1) the defendant has actually copied the plaintiff's
work; 2“ and (2) the copying is

[399 F.Supp.3d 180]

illegal because a substantial similarity exists between the defendant's work and the protectible elements of plaintiff's."" Peter

Multiple tests exist to determine substantial similarity, including, as relevant here, the ""ordinary observer test"" and the

""fragmented literal similarity test."" Estate of Smith v. Cash Money Records, Inc. , 253 F.Supp.3d 737, 746 (S.D.N.Y. 2017)

(citing Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group, Inc. , 150 F.3d 132 , 140 (2d Cir. 1998) ). ""The ordinary

observer test is the "" ‘standard test for substantial similarity.’ "" Estate of Smith, 253 F. Supp.3d at 746 (quoting Peter F. Gaito
602 F.3d at 66 ). This test asks ""whether an ordinary observer, unless he set out to detect the disparities, would be

disposed to overlook them, and regard the aesthetic appeal as the same."" Peter F. Gaito__602 F.3d at 66 (internal quotation
marks and alterations omitted). The Court looks to ""the contested [work]'s total concept and overall feel with that of the

allegedly infringed work, as instructed by our good eyes and common sense."" /d. (citation omitted); see Petrella v. Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. , 572 U.S. 663 , 134 S. Ct. 1962 1977, 188 L.Ed.2d 979 (2014) (quoting with approval the standard set
forth in Peter F. Gaito).

discovery or fact-finding is typically necessary, because what is required is only a visual [aural] comparison of the works.’ ""
Id. (citing Peter F. Gaito, 602 F.3d at 64 ). If a district court determines that the two works are not substantially similar as a
matter of law, then the court ""can properly conclude that the plaintiff's complaint, together with the works incorporated
therein, do not plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief."" Peter F. Gaito._602 F.3d at 64 (citation and internal quotations
omitted); see also Bell v. Blaze Magazine , No. 99 Civ. 12342, 2001 WL 262718, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. March 16, 2001) (If court
determines no reasonable jury could find works substantially similar, or concludes the similarities pertain only to unprotected
elements of the work, ""it is appropriate for the court to dismiss the action because, as a matter of law, there is no copyright
infringement."").

Discussion

|. May States A Claim For Copyright Infringement

Defendants’ argument for dismissal of May's copyright claim can be broken down to three points. First, Defendants argue
that the Phrase is not sufficiently original to be protected by copyright. Second, Defendants contend that there is no
substantial similarity between the two songs to establish infringement. Last, Defendants argue that even if infringement were
established, their use of the Phrase in We Can't Stop is a permitted fair use. Defendants ultimately may be correct with
respect to all three arguments. But whether that is so may be properly determined at summary judgment, not on this motion
to dismiss where reasonable inferences are to be made, and ambiguities resolved, in favor of May, the non-moving party.

[399 F.Supp.3d 182]
A. Whether The Phrase Is Original And Protectable

Defendants first argue that the Phrase is not subject to copyright protection and cannot be the basis for an infringement
claim because (1) the Phrase is not original to May, and (2) the Phrase is not protected by copyright as a matter of law. The
first leg of this argument fails based on a mistaken assumption about May's allegations. The second leg fails because
although some phrases cannot be separately protected as a matter of law, copying a phrase from one copyrighted work into
another work may have the potential to infringe.

1. Whether The Phrase Is Original To May

Much of Defendants’ motion to dismiss is predicated on the premise that May created the Phrase merely by adapting and
partly Anglicizing a well-known, pre-existing Jamaican saying ""Wi run tings. Tings nuh run wi."" (Def. Mem. at 1-2, 9-13; Def.
Reply at 1-3.) According to Defendants, May's adaptation of the Jamaican saying is trivial, does not arise to the level of
originality required for copyright protection, and renders any appropriation of the Phrase merely de minimis and thus non-
actionable.

The problem with this argument is that Defendants’ premise is incorrect. Defendants draw their conclusion from Paragraph
69 of the SAC. That paragraph alleges that the Phrase ""is distinctly May's with its own unique phraseology, meaning and
linguistic combinations using part of the Jamaican Patois dialect and uniquely and creatively mixing same with the English
language. Phonetically, in strict Jamaican Patois, Mr. May's lyrical phrase would be spelled ""Wi run tings. Tings nuh run wi.""
(SAC { 69.) While Defendants’ interpretation may be reasonable, another reasonable interpretation is that May blended
Jamaican Patois and English from scratch. Alleging what the Phrase would read as in Jamaican Patois suggests a
hypothetical, not that the strict Jamaican Patios version preceded May's adaptation. The Court must resolve ambiguities in
favor of May and therefore cannot conclude on this motion that May merely altered a pre-existing saying. And to lay the
matter to rest for purposes of this motion, May confirmed at oral argument that he did not intend his allegations to be
construed in the manner that Defendants do. (Argument Transcript at 4.)

Regardless of how May's allegations are construed, Defendants submit several items obtained from websites to show
indisputably that the Phrase, in either May's version or strict Jamaican Patois, was well-known before May incorporated it
into his song in 1988. ( See Koonce Decl. Exs. E-N.) These materials may well confirm Defendants’ contention. But that is a
matter to be explored in discovery and ultimately considered on summary judgment. TufAmerica__968 F.Supp.2d at 604


--- Page 6 ---
(""assuming, without concluding that ‘say what’ is a common phrase now, the Court cannot at the motion to dismiss stage
conclude that this in fact a common phrase or was a common phrase at the time Say What was recorded""). The materials
cannot form a basis to dismiss the action at this time. The materials are not referenced or included in the SAC. And while
the Court may take judicial notice that these items are copies of material found on the internet, the existence of factual
questions about their content militates against taking judicial notice for the purposes that Defendants ascribe to them. 38

[399 F.Supp.3d 183]

Accordingly, for purposes of this motion to dismiss, the Court deems the Phrase to be original to May.

2. Whether the Phrase Can Be The Basis For Copyright Infringement

Even if the Phrase is original to May, Defendants argue, it cannot be legally protected or serve as a basis for a copyright
infringement claim because it lacks sufficient originality no matter who created it. Here too, Defendants overreach.

It is well established that ""[wJords and phrases, such as titles or slogans, are insufficient to warrant copyright protection, as
they do not exhibit the minimal creativity required for such protection."" Bell v. Blaze Magazine , No. 99 Civ. 12342, 2001 WL
262718, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. March 16, 2001), citing Arica Institute. Inc. v. Palmer, 970 F.2d 1067 , 1072 (2d Cir. 1992) ;see
also McDonald v. West , 138 F. Supp.3d 448, 454 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (""short phrases, including titles and slogans, rarely if ever
exhibit sufficient originality to warrant copyright protection""). This principle is codified in Copyright Office regulations, which
provide: ""[wjords and short phrases such as names, titles, and slogans"" are ""not subject to copyright."" 37 C.F.R. § 202.1.

Were it otherwise, the creative arts would be unduly stifled, contrary to the Constitution's stated goal of promoting the
progress of the arts. U.S. Const. Art. 1 § 8. ""The principle excludes from copyright the ‘raw materials’ of art, like colors,
letters, descriptive facts ... as well as previous creative works that have fallen into the public domain. 22 It likewise excludes
the basic building blocks of music, including tempo and individual notes."" McDonald v. West , 138 F. Supp.3d at 454
(citations omitted). Similarly, words, titles and short phrases, ""rarely if ever exhibit sufficient originality to warrant copyright
protection."" /d. , citing Bell , 2001 WL 262718 at *2 (citing Arica. 970 F.2d at 1072).

The Court agrees that if May applied for copyright protection for the
[399 F.Supp.3d 184]

Phrase alone, he likely would be denied. But that is not what May did. He applied for, and obtained, registration for his song
of which the Phrase is an original (for purposes of this motion as explained above) ""constituent element."" Feist_499 U.S. at
361 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 (1991) ; see also Estate of Smith , 253 F. Supp.3d at 744 (same). Where written works, including lyrics,
are at issue, although an "" ‘ordinary’ [i.e., uncopyrightable] phrase may be quoted without fear of infringement, a copier may
not quote or paraphrase the sequence of creative expression that includes such a phrase.’ "" McDonald , 138 F. Supp.3d at
455, citing (Salinger v. Random House, Inc. , 811 F.2d 90 , 98 (2d Cir. 1987) ). Although May does not claim that
Defendants’ song as a whole infringes his song as a whole, the protection afforded to May should be considered in the
context of his having obtained a copyright for the song in which the Phrase appears.

Indeed, several cases in this Circuit have addressed copyright infringement claims based on allegations of improperly using
a lyrical phrase previously incorporated into a copyrighted song. The varied procedural posture and outcome of those cases
confirm that use of a lyrical phrase from one song in another song may in some instances be the basis for an infringement
claim.

Some of these cases have denied motions to dismiss where defendants made the same or similar argument as Defendants
do. See, e.g., TufAmerica, Inc__968 F. Supp.2d at 604 (denying motion to dismiss copyright claim against defendant who
used the lyrical phrase and recording ""say what"" sampled from plaintiff's song); Williams v. Broadus , 2001 WL 984714, at *4
(denying motion for summary judgment due to question of fact as to whether musical work sampling portions of music and
lyrics from another song gave rise to substantial similarity). By contrast, those cases where motions to dismiss were granted
are distinguishable. For instance, in McDonald v. West, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant's song titled Made In
America was an unlawful copy of the entirety of plaintiff's song with the same title. 138 F.Supp.3d at 459 (""That the songs
share their (ubiquitous, unprotectable) title is not enough to overwhelm the profound dissimilarity of the two works.""). 42 And
some were resolved on summary judgment following discovery. See, e.g., Boone v. Jackson , 206 Fed. App'x 30, 32 (2d Cir.
2006) (affirming summary judgment in favor of defendant as to use of lyrical phrase ""holla back"" and noting deposition
testimony that contradicted plaintiff's prior assertions); see also, Acuff-Rose v. Jostens , 155 F.3d 140 , 143-44 (2d Cir. 1998)
(affirming decision after summary bench trial finding defendant's use of lyrical phrase ""If you don't stand up for something,
you'll fall for anything"" in defendant's advertising for class rings did not infringe).

Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of May, as the Court must at this juncture, the Court cannot conclude that the
Phrase lacks the requisite originality

[399 F.Supp.3d 185]

and cannot serve as the basis for May's claim.


--- Page 7 ---
B. Whether May Plausibly Claims Substantial Similarity

The choice of which substantial similarity test to apply in this case is pivotal. Defendants argue for application of the ordinary
observer test, while May invokes the fragmented literal similarity test. These legal postures are not surprising given that the
ordinary observer test focuses on the ""global"" while the fragmented literal similarity test focuses on the ""local,"" and May's
copyright claim is based on Defendants’ use of a phrase, not the overall similarity of the songs as a whole. See TufAmerica_.,
968 F.Supp.2d at 598 (describing and adopting Plaintiff's argument that copying at issue was example of fragmented literal
similarity and therefore substantial similarity turned on ""localized"" rather than ""global"" similarity between the two pieces).
Indeed, no reasonable juror could conclude that, to the ordinary observer, the two songs are substantially similar as a whole.
Despite sharing use of the Phrase, the songs' lyrics, compositions and recordings are substantially different. See, e.g.,
McDonald, 138 F.Supp.3d at 458 (""listening to the two songs side by side ... makes clear that no reasonable jury could
conclude that they are substantially similar.""). As discussed below, however, the Court agrees that the fragmented literal
similarity test applies here and that for purpose of this motion to dismiss, May has stated a plausible, though tenuous, claim
of copyright infringement.

May's claim is precisely the type that fragmented literal similarity addresses. Rather than claiming the two songs are
comprehensively similar, his claim is predicated on Defendants’ appropriation of a specific phrase ""exactly or nearly exactly.""
“ TufAmerica,968 F. Supp.2d at 597 (applying fragmented similarity test to plaintiff's allegations that defendants copied
several different small samples of plaintiff's songs into various of defendants' songs); see also Estate of Smith , 253
F.Supp.3d at 746 (quoting TufAmerica ); Broadus , 2001 WL 984714, at *3 (applying fragmented similarity analysis where
plaintiff claimed defendants incorporated exact, brief sample of defendant's song into plaintiff's song). As in Broadus and
TufAmerica , ""the alleged infringement in this case involves the literal use of a small portion of the pre-existing work in the
later work, which ‘is analogous to a direct quotation or close paraphrase, rather than the ‘parroting [of] properties that are
apparent only when numerous aesthetic decisions embodied in the plaintiff's work of art ... are considered in relation to one
another.’ "" 968 F.Supp.2d at 597 (citing Broadus , 2001 WL 984714 at *3 and Peter F. Gaito.. 602 F.3d at 66 ) (alterations in
original). 42

[399 F.Supp.3d 186]

As noted earlier, the fragmented literal similarity analysis turns on the qualitative and quantitative significance of the copied
portion in relation to the plaintiff's work as a whole. TufAmerica__968 F.Supp.2d at 598 (citing cases as well as 4 Nimmer §
13.03[A][2], at 13-47 to 48 and note 97). Qualitatively, ""a court considers the nature of the copying: did the defendant copy
important features of the plaintiff's protected expression?"" Rose v. Hewson, No. 17 Civ. 1471, 2018 WL 626350, at *4
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2018). Quantitatively, ""a court determines how much of the plaintiff's protected expression has been
copied."" /d.

Two important aspects of this analysis merit emphasis. First, both quantitative and qualitative significance are taken into
account. See Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. v. Comline Business Data, Inc. 166 F.3d 65 , 71 (2d Cir. 1999) (""It is not possible
to determine infringement through a simple word count; the quantitative analysis of two works must always occur in the
shadow of their qualitative nature.""). Because the copying is literal, ""the copying of even a ‘relatively small’ quantitative
‘portion of the pre-existing work may be substantial if it is of great qualitative importance to the pre-existing work as a whole.”
"" Estate of Smith, 253 F.Supp.3d at 747 (quoting TufAmerica__968 F.Supp.2d at 597 ). Second, the significance is to be
evaluated in relation to the plaintiff's work, not the alleged infringing work. TufAmerica_, 968 F.Supp.2d at 599 ; Broadus ,
2001 WL 984714, at *3 ; 4-13 Nimmer § 13.03 (The relevant question ""is whether the similarity relates to matter that
constitutes a substantial portion of plaintiff's work — not whether such material constitutes a substantial portion of defendant's
work.""). Ultimately, the question is "" ‘[a]t what point does such fragmented similarity become substantial so as to constitute

the borrowing an infringement.’ "" TufAmerica__968 F.Supp.2d at 598 (quoting 4-13 Nimmer § 1303[A][2][a] ).

Here, May plausibly alleges that the Phrase is of sufficient qualitative and quantitative significance to his song that copying
the Phrase can be actionable. Quantitatively, the Phrase appears nine times in We Run Things , and it is the repeated
""hook"" of the chorus. (SAC { 69.) Qualitatively, it encapsulates the overriding theme of the song, which is male domination
and control. 48 The very title of the song draws upon the first half of the Phrase, and those three words make up six of the
seven words it includes. The Phrase may be viewed as ""the heart of [May's] composition."" E/smere Music. Inc. v. National
Broadcasting Company, Inc. , 482 F. Supp. 741 , 744 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), affirmed 623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1980) . In short, May
plausibly alleges that the Phrase is both quantitatively and qualitatively significant to his song sufficient to cross the line from
a trivial to substantial. 44

[399 F.Supp.3d 187]
C. Whether Defendants' Use Is A Fair Use

Even assuming May has a plausible claim for copyright infringement, Defendants contend that the case should be dismissed
because their use qualifies as fair use. As with infringement, however, it is premature to conclude as a matter of law that
May's claim must be dismissed based on Defendants' fair use. Defendants also once again base their argument, in part, on
the improper premise that ""the saying admittedly preexisted plaintiff's use of it."" (Def. Mem. at 19 (discussing fourth fair use
factor); see also, Def. Mem. at 17 (discussing second fair use factor) and 18 (discussing third factor.)


--- Page 8 ---
Fair use is an affirmative defense to copyright infringement, Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc._,510 U.S. 569 , 590, 114
S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) , and thus the party asserting fair use bears the burden of proof. American Geophysical
Union v. Texaco Inc. , 60 F.3d 913 , 918 (2d Cir. 1994). Courts developed the fair use doctrine to preclude a finding of
infringement where ""the copyright law's goal of ‘promoting the Progress of Science and useful Arts’ ... would be better served
by allowing the use than by preventing it."" Castle Rock_._150 F.3d at 141 . Congress codified the fair use doctrine in the
Copyright Act of 1976. Section 107 of the Act provides that ""the fair use of a copyrighted work ... for purposes such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching ... scholarship, or research is not an infringement of copyright"" and identifies
four factors to be considered in determining whether a use is fair. 17 U.S.C. § 107.

The statutory fair use factors are: ""(1) The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) The nature of the copyrighted work; (3) The amount and substantiality of
the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) The effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work."" /d. Because the fair use determination is ""an open-ended and context-sensitive inquiry,” the
examples and factors in the statute are ""illustrative and not limitative ... [and] provide only general guidance about the sorts
of copying that courts and Congress most commonly had found to be fair uses.""_Cariou v. Prince . 714 F.3d 694 , 705 (2d
Cir. 2013) (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577-78 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). ""Ultimately, fair use analysis asks a simple question: Is
this the type of use that furthers the essential goal of copyright law and should be excused from liability for infringement?""
Estate of Smith , 253 F. Supp.3d at 748. See Campbell__510 U.S. at 577 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (Copyright Act's fair use provision
""permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute, when, on occasion, it would stifle the very
creativity that it is designed to foster"").

Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact. Cariou, 714 F.3d at 704-05 . A court cannot engage in the fair use inquiry until it
has been presented with facts relevant to evaluating the fair use factors. See Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enterprises. _ 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (an appellate court may determine that the fair
use defense applies as a matter of law when there are ""facts sufficient to evaluate each

[399 F.Supp.3d 188]

of the statutory factors""). Courts have granted motions to dismiss infringement claims based on a defendant's fair use
defense when ""discovery would not provide any additional relevant information"" and ""[a]ll that is necessary for the court to
make a determination as to fair use are the two [works] at issue."" Arrow Productions, Ltd. v. Weinstein Co. , 44 F. Supp.3d
359, 368 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) ; cf. Lombardo v. Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. , 279 F. Supp.3d 497, 504 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), affirmed
729 Fed. App'x 131 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (""Numerous courts in this district have resolved the issue of fair use on a motion for
judgment on the pleadings by conducting a side-by-side comparison of the works at issue""). ""[D]ue to the fact-sensitive
nature of the inquiry,"" however, ""courts generally do not address the fair use defense until the summary judgment phase.""
Graham v. Prince , 265 F.Supp.3d 366, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), citing TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 839 F.3d 168 , 178
(2d Cir. 2016). In this instance, the fair use factors taken as a whole, based on May's allegations, strongly favor a finding of
fair use. However, as with the infringement issues identified above, further development of the record is required for an
ultimate determination.

1. Purpose and Character of the Use

""The first statutory factor, which courts have referred to as ‘[t]he heart of the fair use inquiry,’ focuses on the nature and
purposes of the allegedly infringing use."" Estate of Smith , 253 F. Supp.3d at 749 (citing Davis v. The Gap, Inc. , 246 F.3d
152 , 174 (2d Cir. 2001) ). This includes determining whether the defendant's use ""is of a commercial nature or for nonprofit
educational uses."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). Defendants’ production, distribution and performance of We Can't Stop indisputably is
commercial. But ""the Court need not make too much of this point ... [given that] ‘nearly all of the illustrative uses listed in the
preamble of § 107 ... are generally conducted for profit.’ "" Castle Rock._150 F.3d at 132 (quoting Campbell__510 U.S. at 584
, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

Rather, the salient question for the first factor is ""whether and to what extent the new work is ‘transformative.’ "" Campbell,
510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . ""This is a critical issue because ‘[t]he more the appropriator is using the copied material
for new, transformative purposes, the more it serves copyright's goal of enriching public knowledge and the less likely it is
that the appropriation will serve as a substitute for the original or its plausible derivatives.’"" Estate of Smith , 253 F. Supp.3d
at 749 (quoting_Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 214 (2d Cir. 2001) ). ""Accordingly, the relevant inquiry on this
factor is whether the new work ‘merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with
a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.’ "" /d. (quoting Campbell
510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

The parties disagree about whether Defendants’ use of the Phrase is transformative. On one hand, Defendants use the
Phrase in the same creative medium as does May, namely a song lyric, rather than in a different creative modality such as
affixing the Phrase in a collage. May also argues that both songs are thematically similar, using the Phrase to convey a
message of control and self-determination. 45

[399 F.Supp.3d 189]

On the other hand, Defendants argue that the songs are thematically opposite of each other. The songs' lyrics squarely


--- Page 9 ---
confirm Defendants' characterization and contradict May's. We Run Things employs the Phrase to deliver a message of
male dominance, including subjugation of women. The song's repeated refrain ""We rule girl, girl no rule we"" underscores
exactly that. In contrast, Cyrus's We Can't Stop is a song of female independence and control. In We Can't Stop , women
""own the night,"" they can do and say what they want, they can kiss and love who they want. Like other cases where the
specific message conveyed is different than the larger common theme, We Can't Stop ""adds something new,"" transforming
the Phrase ""with new expression, meaning, or message."" See Estate of Smith , 253 F. Supp.3d at 749-750 (defendants'
incorporation of 35 seconds of plaintiff's song was transformative fair use where defendant used it to convey the message
that all types of ""real music"" is ""the only thing that's gonna last"" whereas the key phrase of plaintiff's song conveyed the
message that ""Jazz is the only real music that's gonna last""); Bourne Co. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. , 602 F.
Supp.2d 499 , 509 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (finding transformative use where both songs were written to express the wish of the
singer, but the lyrics were ""strikingly different in tone and message"").

Moreover, the Phrase is deployed differently in the two songs, enhancing the different messages. We Run Things gives the
Phrase a predominant role, including its title and the lead lyric of the chorus. May characterizes the Phrase as the ""anthem""

of his song. (PI. Mem. At 13.) In contrast, the Phrase cannot plausibly be considered the ""anthem"" of We Can't Stop. The
Phrase plays a much less prominent role in Cyrus' song, appearing only three times and each time toward the end of the
chorus. In effect, the Phrase itself is dominated by the rest of the song whereas the opposite is true in We Run Things. Thus,
Defendants’ ""purposes in using [the original work] are sharply different from [the original artist's] goals in creating it.""_Blanch
v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 252 (2d Cir. 2006). This factor weighs in favor of fair use.

2. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second statutory factor ""calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection
than others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied."" Campbell,
510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . "" ‘Two types of distinctions as to the nature of the copyrighted work have emerged that
have figured in the decisions evaluating the second factor: (1) whether the work is expressive or creative, such as a work of
fiction, or more factual, with greater leeway being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work is factual or informational,
and (2) whether the work is published or unpublished, with the scope for fair use involving unpublished works being
considerably narrower.’"" Estate of Smith , 253 F. Supp.3d at 751 (quoting 2 Howard B. Abrams, The Law Of Copyright, §
15:52 (2006)). As the Second Circuit has noted, this factor ""is rarely found to be determinative."" Davis. 246 F.3d at 175 .

May's song indisputably is expressive and creative, thus cutting against fair use. On the other hand, May published the
[399 F.Supp.3d 190]

song decades ago, which creates a wider berth for fair use than if the song had not been published. Overall, however, ""[t]his
factor is of particularly ‘limited usefulness,’ "" where, as here, "" ‘the creative work of art is being used for a transformative
purpose."" Estate of Smith , 253 F. Supp.3d at 751 (quoting_Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. 448 F.3d 605 ,
612 (2d Cir. 2006) ).

3. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

The next factor requires considering ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as
a whole."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). ""The ‘clear implication’ of this inquiry ‘is that a finding of fair use is more likely when small
amounts, or less important passages, are copied than when the copying is more extensive, or encompasses the most
important parts of the original.’ "" Estate of Smith , 253 F. Supp.3d at 751 (quoting Authors Guild__804 F.3d at 221 ). ""Thus,
the test is ‘whether the quantity and value of the materials used[ ] are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.’ ""
Id. (quoting Blanch_, 467 F.3d at 257 ); see also Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 144 (""The inquiry must focus upon whether ‘[t]he
extent of ... copying’ is consistent with or more than necessary to further ‘the purpose and character of the use."") (quoting
Campbell__510 U.S. at 586-87 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ) (alterations in original). This factor thus employs both a quantitative and
qualitative assessment, tempered, however, by determining the extent to which the appropriation is consistent with the
transformative use.

Here, the amount taken by Defendants appears to be reasonable in proportion to the needs of the transformative use. As
already described in the fragmented literal similarity analysis, Defendants used a lyrical phrase that is both a quantitatively
and qualitatively substantial part of May's song. However, Defendants used only the Phrase, without copying either the
musical notes or sound accompanying it. 48 And as noted in discussing the transformative use, Defendants deployed the
Phrase consistently with the message of female empowerment. Coming near the end of the chorus, the Phrase plays a

subservient role in We Can't Stop , whereas it is the dominant element of We Run Things.

Ultimately, however, this factor cannot be assessed without further development of the record examining what Defendants
sought to accomplish and how they did so. For instance, why did Defendants include the Phrase in the recurring chorus of
the song? What purpose was served by selecting the particular version of the Phrase that they did? Did Defendants
consider varying the wording of the Phrase each time it was used in the chorus? Questions such of these may shed further
light on ""whether ‘[t]he extent of ... copying’ is consistent with or more than necessary to further the purpose and character of
the use."") Castle Rock__150 F.3d at 144 (quoting Campbell__510 U.S. at 586-87 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ) (alterations in original).



--- Page 10 ---
4. Effect on the Market for the Copyrighted Work

The fourth factor examines ""the effect of the [secondary] use upon the potential
[399 F.Supp.3d 191]

market for or value of the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). ""At this stage, courts ask ‘whether the copy brings to the
marketplace a competing substitute for the original, or its derivative, so as to deprive the rights holder of significant revenues
because of the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original.’ "" Estate of
Smith , 253 F. Supp.3d at 752 (quoting Authors Guild_, 804 F.3d at 223 ); see also Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 145 (noting that
the ""concern is not whether the secondary use suppresses or even destroys the market for the original work or its potential
derivatives, but whether the secondary use usurps the market of the original work""). ""The fourth factor is also, however,
closely linked to the first, in the sense that ‘the more the copying is done to achieve a purpose that differs from the purpose
of the original, the less likely it is that the copy will serve as a satisfactory substitute for the original.’"" Estate of Smith , 253
F. Supp.3d at 752 (quoting Authors Guild__804 F.3d at 223 ); see also Castle Rock__150 F.3d at 145 (""The more
transformative the secondary use, the less likelihood that the secondary use substitutes for the original."").

The SAC makes no allegation that We Can't Stop usurps any potential market for We Run Things as a whole or its
derivatives. It does allege, however, that industry standard practice is to clear rights to such ""lyrical similarities."" (SAC
115.) May also alleges that he previously ""gave permission"" for the Phrase, along with the entirety of his song, to be used in
a movie soundtrack. (SAC § 73.) That was 20 years ago, however, and May makes no allegations that he has received any
revenue or credit from licensing the song or its lyrics since then. 42 Whether there even is a ""market"" for licensing May's song
in order to be able to use just the Phrase is dubious, but not a conclusion the Court can make on this motion. 48 Meanwhile,
Defendants saw fit to provide writing credit to the songwriters of ""LaDiLaDi"" for incorporating an interpolated sample of it in
We Can't Stop. (SAC § 104.) That indicates that Defendants were willing to take a license to a lyrical phrase and that May
was deprived of receiving similar credit or compensation for use of the lyrical phrase from his song. Accordingly, taking
May's allegations as true and making reasonable inferences in his favor, this factor potentially could weigh against finding
fair use.

5. Overall Assessment of Fair Use

In sum, analysis of the relevant factors strongly indicates that Defendants’ use of the Phrase is a fair use. Factual questions
remain, however, as to certain of the fair use factors, particularly the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation

to the needs of Defendants' transformative use, and the effect on the market, if any, for May's work. See, e.g., Hirsch v. CBS
Broadcasting, Inc. , No. 17 Civ. 1860, 2017 WL 3393845, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. August 4, 2017) (denying motion

[399 F.Supp.3d 192]

to dismiss based on fair use due to fact issues requiring development and emphasizing the fact-intensive and context-

sensitive nature of the fair use inquiry); New Jersey Media Group, Inc. v. Pirro , 74 F.Supp.3d 605, 623 (S.D.N.Y. 2015)
(denying summary judgment of fair use due to questions of fact as to some but not all fair use factors).

ll. Damages Issues

A copyright plaintiff seeking monetary compensation must choose between two different types of damages — actual
damages (including defendant's profits attributable to the infringement) or statutory damages. Defendants contend that
May's actual damages are limited to the three-year period before he filed suit. Defendants also contend that May is not
entitled to statutory damages, or attorney's fees for that matter, because May registered his copyright long after Defendants’
alleged infringement began. Defendants are correct as to actual damages. Defendants may also be correct as to statutory
damages and attorney's fees, but it is premature to make that determination.

A. Statute of Limitations

A copyright claim must be brought within three years from the time the claim accrues. 17 U.S.C. § 507 ; see Petrella v.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. , 572 U.S. 663 , 676, 134 S.Ct. 1962 , 188 L.Ed.2d 979 (2014) (referring to the Copyright Act's
""three-year look-back period""). ""A copyright claim ... arises or ‘accrue[s]’ when an infringing act occurs."" /d. at 670, 134 S. Ct.
1962 , 1977. Accordingly, ""an infringement is actionable within three years, and only three years, of its occurrence.""Id. at
671, 134 S. Ct. 1962 , 1977. The SAC alleges that the defendants’ infringing acts extend back to at least June 3, 2013 when
We Can't Stop was first released. (SAC § 90.) May, however, filed this action on March 13, 2018. He therefore cannot
recover damages for any infringement occurring prior to March 13, 2015, and his claims should be dismissed to the extent
they seek damages for acts of infringement preceding that date. 42

B. Statutory Damages and Attorney's Fees

The question of whether May is entitled to statutory damages and attorney's fees is a somewhat closer question. The
Copyright Act permits a copyright plaintiff to receive statutory damages and attorney's fees only if the plaintiff's work has
been registered with the Copyright Office prior to the act of infringement. As the Act admonishes, ""no award of statutory
damages or of attorney's fees ... shall be made for ... any infringement of copyright commenced after first publication of the


--- Page 11 ---
work and before the effective date of its registration."" 17 U.S.C. § 412 ; see also Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd. , 71 F.3d
996 , 1012 (2d Cir. 1995) (reciting and applying the principle); Steele v. Bell, No. 11 Civ. 9343, 2014 WL 1979227, at *3
(S.D.N.Y. March 28, 2014) (""To encourage registration, Congress provided that owners of unpublished works could recover
statutory damages and attorney's fees only for instances of infringement that occurred after registration.""). According to May,
We Run Things ""was released to the public in 1988"" (SAC 68), and the alleged infringement began as early as June 3,
2013. But May did not register We Run Things until 2017. (SAC { 74.) Under a plain application of Section 412, May is not
entitled to statutory

[399 F.Supp.3d 193]
damages or attorney's fees because he registered his copyright long after infringement began.

To escape this limitation on his potential recovery, May argues that Defendants continued to infringe his work after he
registered it. (PI. Mem. at 21.) May further contends that discovery is needed to determine all of Defendants' infringing acts
and when they occurred. ( /d. ) Courts in this Circuit, however, have rejected the ""continuing"" infringement theory.
""Repeatedly, these courts have concluded that ‘Section 412 imposes a bright-line rule, barring the recovery of statutory
damages for infringement occurring after registration if that infringement is part of an ongoing series of infringing acts and the
first act occurred before registration.’ "" Steele v. Bell, No.11 Civ. 9343, 2014 WL 1979227, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. March 28, 2014),
quoting U2 Home Entertainment, Inc. v. Hong Wei International Trading, Inc. , No. 04 Civ. 6189, 2008 WL 3906889, at *15
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2008) (plaintiff not entitled to statutory damages and attorney's fees for installments in television series
released prior to registration and distributed by defendant as few as eight days or as much as two years post-registration);
see also Solid Oak Sketches, LLC v. 2K Games, Inc. , No. 16 Civ. 724, 2016 WL 4126543, at * 3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 2018)
(new edition of video game issued a year later was a continuing series of infringement precluding recovery of statutory
damages and attorney's fees); Shady Records, Inc. v. Source Enterprises, Inc. , No. 03 Civ. 9944, 2005 WL 14920 (S.D.N.Y.
Jan. 3, 2005) (reposting infringing content one month later was ""nothing more than the continuation of a series of acts"" that
began prior to registration); Singh v. Famous Overseas, Inc. , 680 F. Supp. 533 , 534-36 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) (concluding that
post-registration sales of copyrighted songs constituted a continuing act of infringement), aff'd without opinion__923 F.2d 845

(2d Cir. 1990) .

In Steele , for example, the plaintiff obtained a default judgment against defendant for infringing plaintiffs copyrighted film.
The defendant had displayed a trailer and photograph from the film on various websites. In response to cease and desist
letters sent by plaintiff, the defendant removed the infringing material on October 19, 2011. A registration for plaintiff's
copyright became effective on October 25, 2011. Three days later, the defendant reposted the infringing content. The
plaintiff argued that the reposting was a new act of infringement for which plaintiff would be entitled to statutory damages.
The court disagreed, applying the ""bright-line"" rule barring statutory damages and attorney's fees for a series of continuing
infringements. /d. at *9. More specifically, the court held that ""Defendant's re-posting of the same content through the same
medium constitutes a continuing infringement, and Section 412 precludes the recovery of statutory damages and attorney's

fees."" Id.

The well-established ""bright-line"" application of Section 412 would seem to foreclose May's bid for attorney's fees and
statutory damages. That said, the instant case potentially may be distinguished from Steele and the other similar cases in
one respect. May alleges that Defendants have infringed his work not merely by issuing an infringing record, but also by
performing the song live and in video, and through other media. (SAC {f 118-132,154, 164.) Unlike Steele, the infringement
alleged by May is not limited to a recurrence of ""the same medium."" That distinction may prove to be inconsequential, but at
this juncture, it is premature to determine that May cannot possibly recover statutory damages and attorneys' fees were he
to succeed on the merits. Discovery is needed to determine, for instance, the types and extent of

[399 F.Supp.3d 194]

media in which the Phrase was used and whether May sent cease and desist letters for each act of allegedly new
infringement. 52

To be sure, Defendants have a far stronger argument in this regard. Although May alleges infringing conduct through various
media, they all have one thing in common: the song We Can't Stop. As such, the evidence may well confirm that the alleged
series of acts are sufficiently related to bar statutory damages and attorney's fees. If that is the case, Defendants would be
entitled to summary judgment on this issue. At this stage, however, the Court cannot conclude that there are no aspects of
the alleged infringing acts that would not constitute a new infringing act for purposes of the registration rule. Accordingly,
Defendants’ motion to dismiss May's claim for statutory damages and attorney's fees should be denied.

Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, | recommend that Defendants’ motion to dismiss be GRANTED in part, limiting pre-filing
damages to a three-year period, and DENIED in all other respects. The current record suggests several ways in which
Defendants may well prevail on the merits, from a determination that the Phrase was not original to May or that May made
only trivial changes to a pre-existing strict Patois version of the Phrase, to indisputable proof that Defendants did not copy
from May's song but instead adopted the Phrase from one of many other sources, to facts establishing fair use as a matter
of law. Those determinations, however, must await summary judgment.

37 For purposes of this motion, Defendants do not expressly accept May's allegations of actual copying. However, neither Defendants’ opening brief nor
their reply address the issue of actual copying. At oral argument, defense counsel alluded to probative similarity, which is a factor in the copying analysis,
but did not develop the argument. Accordingly, the Court need not address it on this motion, and the only infringement issue to be discussed is
substantial similarity. See Board of Managers of Mason Fisk Condominium v. 72 Berry St., LLC, 801 F.Supp.2d 30 , 39 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (""[aJrguments
raised for the first time at oral argument are generally deemed waived"") (citing Tamar v. Mind C.T.I., Ltd._723 F.Supp.2d 546 , 555 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) );

arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief, let alone [at or] after oral argument"" (alterations in original) (quoting United States v. Barnes, 158 F.3d
662 , 672 (2d Cir. 1998) ).

38 See Faulkner v. Beer , 463 F.3d 130 , 134 (2d Cir. 2006) (reversing grant of motion to dismiss because district court considered materials outside
pleading where materials were not integral to or referenced in complaint and other conditions had not been met); Stinnett v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. , 278
F.Supp.3d 599, 607 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (""a court may not consider external materials in its ruling when reliance on such materials leads the court to ‘making
a finding of fact that controvert[s] the plaintiff's own factual assertions set out in its complaint.’ "") (quoting Global Network Communications, Inc. v. City of
New York, 458 F.3d 150 , 156 (2d Cir. 2006) ).

38 Just as the SAC is ambiguous about exactly what May alleges with respect to origination of the Phrase, May's briefing contains seemingly contradictory
information about whether the Phrase was in the public domain prior to Defendants’ use and thus available for use without permission. In copyright law,
the public domain refers to material that no longer is, or never was, protected by copyright. See 3 Nimmer § [9A].01 (""Basically, the term connotes the
opposite of legal protection""); Feist. 499 U.S. at 348 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 (referring to facts as example of public domain material that is ""available to every
person""). Throughout much of his briefing, May argues that the Phrase was not in the public domain. (PI. Mem. at 20-21.) Curiously, just a page later
May's brief states ""Plaintiff's original lyrics/lyrical phrase pre-existed Defendants’ unlawful use of same and was in the public domain, as any Google or
Internet search would reveal decades before Defendants’ unlawfully took, copied and used same."" (PI. Mem. at 22.) As experienced copyright lawyers,
May's counsel would be expected to know what they were conveying by saying the Phrase had been in the public domain for quite some time before
Defendant's use. At oral argument, however, May's counsel denied using the term in that instance to mean that the Phrase was free for anyone to use in
any way. (Argument Transcript at 15-16.) Rather, as suggested by the context in which it appears, use of ""the public domain” in this particular instance
conveys that May's song was well known and widely available at the time of Defendants’ use such that Defendants were aware of it and had access to it.

40 Cases cited by Defendants regarding lack of protection for phrases used in other media similarly are distinguishable in that they were premised on titles
and unprotectable ideas and concepts. See Bell , 2001 WL 262718 at *3-4 (motion to dismiss granted where plaintiff, author of an article titled ""Hip Hop
Behind The Walls,” claimed infringement by defendant's article titled ""Hip Hop Behind Bars"" based on copying his ideas and using a similar title); Boyle v.
Stephens , No. 97 Civ. 1351, 1998 WL 80175, at “5-6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 1998) (motion to dismiss granted against plaintiff claiming infringement by
defendant's mutual fund advertising and promotional material based on use of the word ""series,"" using graphics to illustrate fund characteristics and
describing similar concepts).

41 Because nearly exact copying suffices, it is inconsequential that the Phrase as used in We Can't Stop substitutes ""don't"" for ""no,"" so that the Phrase
reads ""We run things, Things don't run we.""

42 In a footnote, Defendants contend that the fragmented similarity test does not apply and only is appropriate for cases involving digitally copied samples
of song recordings such as those at issue in TufAmerica . (Def. Mem. at 13 n.4.) But Defendants fail to offer any logical distinction between copying a
fragment of a recording and copying a fragment of a composition's lyric that would make the fragmented literal similarity test inapplicable to the latter.
Copying the lyric alone no doubt makes for a weaker infringement claim since fewer elements of the original are taken. That may ultimately merit a
different outcome, but not a different test. See Broadus , 2001 WL 984714, at *3 (""That this case involves the practice of sampling does not alter the
substantial similarity] analysis.""); 4 Nimmer § 13.03 [A][2][b] (explaining faulty analysis in Sixth Circuit that conclusion musical recording sampling merits
different analysis). Moreover, fragmented literal similarity is applied to copyright claims involving other media, not just music. See, e.g., Best Cellars Inc.
v. Grape Finds at Dupont, Inc. . 90 F. Supp.2d 431 , 460 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (applying fragmented similarity test to printed and web-based promotional
materials); Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Carol Publishing Group , 11 F.Supp.2d 329 , 333-34 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (applying fragmented similarity test to
book's incorporation of synopses and verbatim quotes from Star Trek television series), aff'd__181 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 1999) .

43 As discussed below in connection with fair use, although May describes the theme of his song as personal freedom and control regardless of gender, a
review of the lyrics shows otherwise; We Run Things distinctly focuses on control by men, including control of women.

44The cases Defendants cite in support of their argument that the alleged copying is merely trivial, de minimis and non-actionable were decided on
summary judgment, not a motion to dismiss. Further, they are distinguishable. See VMG Salsoul, LLC v. Ciccone__824 F.3d 871 , 887 (9th Cir. 2016)
(alleged infringement based on merely using a modified version of a .23-second segment of horns from an earlier song); Bridgeport Music, Inc. v.
Dimension Films, 410 F.3d 792 , 796-97, 805 (6th Cir. 2005) (reversing district court's grant of summary judgment that sampling, modifying and looping



--- Page 14 ---
two-seconds of sound recording was de minimis ).

45 May acknowledges that the Court can take judicial notice of the songs' themes. (PI. Mem. at 13.) See, e.g., Kaye v. Cartoon Network, Inc. , 297
F.Supp.3d 362, 367-370 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (court assessed theme, among other elements, on motion to dismiss copyright infringement claim that television
series infringed comic book series); McDonald v. West, 138 F. Supp.3d at 457 (comparing themes of original song and allegedly infringing song); Allen v.
Scholastic, Inc. , 739 F.Supp.2d 642 , 655 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (when both works are attached or referenced in complaint, the court, on motion to dismiss,
can assess theme, among other factors considered to determine substantial similarity of literary works).

48 The SAC alleges that ""Defendants' infringement includes the unlawful appropriation of May's vocal melody/cadence/rhythm/inflection contained in"" his
song. ( e.g. , SAC § 119.) These allegations are merely conclusory and never plausibly supported with alleged facts. Recordings of both songs suggest
instead that the songs are musically very different. See McDonald, 138 F. Supp.3d at 453 (""Courts in this district regularly apply th[e] rule"" that "" ‘the
works themselves supersede and control contrary descriptions of them’ contained in the pleadings or elsewhere"") (citing cases).

47 May never actually alleges that he licensed anything, but rather that he ""gave permission."" The SAC does not expressly allege that May received any
revenue for having given permission but does assert that May “was given proper credit in the film"" for it. (SAC. 4 73.)

48 May's brief states that he ""would absolutely develop or license secondary uses of his lyrics/lyrical phrase/song,"" thereby implicitly suggesting the
absence of any licensing history or existing market for his now 30-year-old work. (PI. Mem. at 19-20.) The likelihood of there being a market for use of the
Phrase in particular seems all the more unlikely given that there appear to be many sources other than May's song where the Phrase can be found. (
See, e.g. , Koonce Decl. Ex. F, G, H, J, L, P, S, U.)

429 May does not address this issue in his brief and conceded the point at oral argument. (Argument Transcript at 23.)

50 The absence of such letters would suggest that May did not consider subsequent events to be new acts of infringement.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

JULIE A. ROBINSON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE

In this lawsuit, Plaintiff Assessment Technologies Institute, LLC (""ATI"") brings the following claims against Defendant Cathy
Parkes, doing business as Level Up RN, arising out of her sale and distribution of nursing-education study material:
copyright infringement under the Copyright Act, misappropriation of trade secrets under the Defend Trade Secrets Act
(""DTSA"") and the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (""KUTSA""), unfair competition under Kansas law, and breach of
contract under Kansas law. Before the Court are Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 295), Defendant's
Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 298), and Defendant's Motion for Leave to File Sur-Reply in Opposition to Plaintiff's
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 351). For the reasons explained fully below, the Court grants Defendant's
motion for leave to file surreply, denies Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, and grants in part and denies in part
Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

|. Summary Judgment Standard

Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party demonstrates that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact
and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 1In applying this standard, the court views the evidence and all
reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. 2""There is no genuine issue of material
fact unless the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is such that a reasonable jury could
return a verdict for the nonmoving party."" 3

[588 F.Supp.3d 1189]

A fact is ""material"" if, under the applicable substantive law, it is ""essential to the proper disposition of the claim."" 4An issue of
fact is ""genuine"" if ""the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.""©

To prevail on a motion for summary judgment on a claim upon which the moving party also bears the burden of proof at trial,
the moving party must demonstrate ""no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party."" Defendant
raises several affirmative defenses in response to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment that are not separately raised in
Defendant's motion for summary judgment. In considering these affirmative defenses, the Court is mindful that

when the plaintiff moves for summary judgment on an entire claim, it is necessarily also moving for summary
judgment on any affirmative defenses to that claim. It is therefore incumbent on a defendant that wishes to
prevent entry of summary judgment on the claim to come forward with evidence showing the existence of a
genuine factual dispute concerning an affirmative defense that, if ultimately successful, would defeat the claim. Z

Thus, the Court rejects Plaintiff's contention that the Court should not consider the affirmative defenses invoked in
Defendant's response to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment because they were not raised in Defendant's own motion
for summary judgment. The Court considers whether Defendant has come forward with evidence showing a genuine issue
of material fact concerning an affirmative defense that would defeat Plaintiff's claims if successful.

Finally, summary judgment is not a ""disfavored procedural shortcut;"" on the contrary, it is an important procedure ""designed
to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action."" 2In responding to a motion for summary
judgment, ""a party cannot rest on ignorance of facts, on speculation, or on suspicion and may not escape summary
judgment in the mere hope that something will turn up at trial."" 2

Il. Factual Background
A. Evidentiary Rulings

Before reciting the uncontroverted facts in this matter, the Court must rule on the following evidentiary issues: (1)
Defendant's authentication and foundation objections; (2) Plaintiff's hearsay objections; and (3) Plaintiffs objections to
Defendant's affidavit as self-serving. In considering these objections, the Court is mindful that summary judgment evidence
need not be ""in a form that would be admissible at trial."" 1° But ""the content or

[588 F.Supp.3d 1190]

substance of the evidence must be admissible."" 11 As the advisory committee note to the 2010 Federal Rule amendment
explains: ""The burden is on the proponent to show that the material is admissible as presented or to explain the admissible
form that is anticipated."" 42""The requirement is that the party submitting the evidence show that it will be possible to put the
information, the substance or content of the evidence, into an admissible form."" 13

1. Defendant's Authentication and Foundation Objections

Defendant objects that several exhibits Plaintiff offers in support of its motion for summary judgment are not properly
authenticated. To meet the authentication requirement in Fed. R. Evid. 901(a), ""the proponent must produce evidence
sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.""14 An affidavit is not required to authenticate
every document submitted with a motion for summary judgment. 45""[D]ocuments produced during discovery that are on the
letterhead of the opposing, producing party are authentic per se for purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence 901."" 18 Moreover,
a document may ""be sufficiently authenticated taking into consideration the ‘[a]ppearance, contents, substance, internal
patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances, even if they do not appear on [the
opposing party's] letterhead."" 12 The Tenth Circuit has counseled that ""the bar for authentication of evidence is not
particularly high."" 18

Defendant also raises foundation objections. Under Fed. R. Evid. 602, a witness ""may testify to a matter only if evidence is
introduced sufficient to support a finding that [he] has personal knowledge of the matter."" The witness's own testimony can
provide evidence of personal knowledge. 12

a. Schuman Declaration

Plaintiff submitted the declaration of its counsel Brett Schuman to authenticate many of the challenged summary judgment
exhibits—Exhibits 21-30 and 33. Schuman attests in the declaration that he has ""personal knowledge of the facts set forth
in this declaration,"" and that each exhibit is a true and correct copy. 22 Schuman states that Exhibits 21-27 are true and
correct copies of documents produced by Plaintiff during discovery, which are Bates stamped. Schuman further states that
Exhibits 28-30 are versions of ATI's Terms and Conditions—Exhibit 28 was marked and introduced during Defendant's
deposition, while the other two versions

are Bates stamped. Finally, Schuman states that ""Exhibit 33 is a true and correct copy of a log of user activity on ATI's
website for the ATI user ‘Cathy A Parkes,’ with a physical address at ‘2852 Camino Serbal, Carlsbad, California,’ and an
email address of ‘cathy@leveluprn.com,’ that was produced by ATI in this Action under Bates No. ATI0124227."" 21

The Court overrules and denies Defendant's objection as to Exhibits 22-27, 29, 30, and 33 because Schuman's declaration
reveals the source of the records—they were all produced during discovery and bear Plaintiff's Bates stamp. 22 The Court
easily finds that Schuman, as one of Plaintiff's attorneys, has personal knowledge that these documents were produced by
Plaintiff during discovery. Moreover, the Court has reviewed the exhibits and finds that their contents, coupled with
Schuman's declaration and their Bates stamps, sufficiently authenticate them. Exhibit 28, Plaintiff's 2013 Terms and
Conditions, does not contain a Bates stamp, and although it was introduced during Defendant's deposition, her testimony is
not sufficient to authenticate it. 22 However, ATI offers the declaration of Jeff Marsh with its summary judgment reply, which
sufficiently authenticates Exhibit 28. Marsh is the Test Security Manager at Ascend Learning, which is the parent company
of ATI, and has worked there since 2012. He is responsible for ""establishing and implementing any new policies and
procedures"" to make ATI content secure, and attests to having personal knowledge that the 2013 Terms and Conditions
exhibit is a true and correct copy. 24Marsh's job responsibilities allow the Court to easily infer that he has personal
knowledge about the authenticity of these documents. This is sufficient under Fed. R. Evid. 602 to demonstrate the witness's
personal knowledge. Defendant's objection to Exhibit 28 is overruled and denied.

b. Exhibit 21

Defendant objects to Exhibit 21, Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's Second Set of Interrogatories, because it was not
""signed under oath by anyone who is competent to testify to the facts contained therein, or who has personal knowledge of
the facts."" 25 The Court agrees with Plaintiff that Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) allows a party to support a factual position by
citing to interrogatory answers, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(5) only requires that the person who ""makes"" the answers sign
them. Plaintiff's attorneys signed the answers to interrogatories. And Schuman—one of the answer's signatories—states in
his declaration


--- Page 3 ---
[588 F.Supp.3d 1192]

that this document is what it says it is. The Court finds this is sufficient under the Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 and 33, and Fed. R. Evid.
901 ; therefore, the objection is overruled and denied.

c. Preliminary Injunction Hearing Exhibit 1

Defendant objects to Plaintiff's reliance on ATI's User Terms and Conditions offered and admitted during the preliminary
injunction hearing as ATI Exhibit 1, filed as Doc. 14-10. The parties specifically stipulated to the authenticity of this exhibit in
the Pretrial Order. 22 Therefore, Defendant's objection is overruled and denied.

d. Preliminary Injunction Hearing Exhibit 14-11

And finally, Defendant objects to Mark Williams-Abrams’ Declaration, which was admitted by stipulation during the
preliminary injunction hearing. 22 Defendant argues that Williams-Abrams lacks personal knowledge to support the statement
in { 30 of his declaration that ""[s]tudents taking the ATI Proctored Exams must click the ‘I Agree’ box next to the following
terms that are conspicuously displayed on a screen prior to beginning an ATI Proctored Exam [screen shot of the terms and
check box]."" 28 The objection is overruled and denied. Abrams-Williams attests in the declaration that he has personal
knowledge of the facts stated therein, and his personal knowledge can easily be inferred from his position as Chief Product
Officer at ATI, which is described in §§ 4—5 of the declaration. This is sufficient under Fed. R. Evid. 602 to demonstrate the
witness's personal knowledge. 22 Defendant's objection goes to the weight and not the admissibility of his testimony.

2. Plaintiff's Hearsay Objection to Exhibits 821 and 822

Plaintiff objects that Defendant's Exhibits 821 and 822 are inadmissible hearsay. 2° These exhibits memorialize an October
19, 2018 conversation between Defendant's husband, Bill Parkes, and Becky Pontes, the Senior Corporate Paralegal and
Intellectual Property Specialist for Ascend Learning, ATI's parent company. 3! Exhibit 821 is a calendar entry for Bill Parkes
with notes about the conversation. Exhibit 822 is an instant message from Bill Parkes setting forth his notes from the
conversation. These objections are overruled and denied.

""‘Hearsay’ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in
[588 F.Supp.3d 1193]

evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted."" 32 The proponent of the summary judgment evidence must make some
showing that the substance of the evidence would be admissible at trial by either demonstrating that an exception to the
hearsay rule applies, or that the declarant would testify to the document's contents. 33

To the extent Bill Parkes’ notes are offered to show that he made them and they were relayed to Defendant, they are not
being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Pontes’ statements in these exhibits are also admissible for the truth of the
matter asserted because they are statements by a party opponent. This exclusion to the hearsay rule applies if the
""statement is offered against the opposing party"" and was either ""made by the party in an individual or representative
capacity,"" ""made by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on the subject,"" or ""made by the party's agent
or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed."" 34 It is undisputed that Pontes had a
conversation with Bill Parkes on October 19, 2018, and it is undisputed that Pontes was making the statement on behalf of
ATI. To the extent Pontes disputes the content of the conversation, that goes to the weight and not the admissibility of
Exhibits 821 and 822. Plaintiff's hearsay objections to exhibit 821 and 822 are overruled and denied.

3. Plaintiff's Objection to Defendant's Declaration

Plaintiff repeatedly objects that Defendant's declaration is ""self-serving,"" and thus not sufficient to create a genuine issue of
material fact. But Plaintiff fails to elaborate on why the self-serving nature of the declaration mandates its exclusion. As the
Tenth Circuit has explained, ""virtually any party's testimony can be considered ‘self-serving,’ and self-serving testimony is
competent to oppose summary judgment."" 25A declaration is competent summary judgment evidence if it ""is based upon
personal knowledge and sets forth facts that would be admissible in evidence."" 36 Plaintiff offers no argument as to why or
how the declaration is not based on personal knowledge. The Court has reviewed the declaration and finds that Defendant's
statements therein satisfy the personal knowledge requirement because they relay her first-hand experiences and
impressions. Plaintiff's objections are overruled and denied because they go to the credibility of Defendant's sworn
statements, not their admissibility. 22

Plaintiff separately lodges a meritorious objection that certain statements in Defendant's declaration are inadmissible
conclusions of law about whether Plaintiff's material is protectable under copyright law or constitutes a trade secret. $8 The
Court disregards Defendant's declaration to the extent

[588 F.Supp.3d 1194]
it advances legal opinions or attempts to apply the law to the facts of this case. 32
B. Uncontroverted Facts

Having resolved the parties’ evidentiary objections, the Court now recites the following material facts, which are


--- Page 4 ---
uncontroverted, stipulated, or viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.

Plaintiff ATI is a provider of educational and assessment nursing education resources, which include review modules,
practice tests to assess students’ understanding of specific content areas, and proctored examinations administered in a
secure, proctored environment to assess students’ nursing knowledge. The review modules are textbooks that are divided
into nine topic areas: (1) Fundamentals for Nursing; (2) Nursing Leadership and Management; (3) Nutrition for Nursing; (4)
RN Adult Medical Surgical Nursing; (5) RN Community Health Nursing; (6) RN Maternal Newborn Nursing; (7) RN Mental
Health Nursing; (8) RN Nursing Care of Children; and (9) RN Pharmacology for Nursing. Plaintiff created editions of its
review modules covering these nine topic areas in 2013 and 2016. Plaintiff owns valid U.S. copyright registrations for each
edition of its review modules.

The selection, organization, and arrangement of nursing information in each review module is developed by many ATI
employees across different ATI departments.

Plaintiff also publishes quizzes within its nine review modules that it sells to the public and resells on Amazon. Plaintiff
includes quizzes in its Comprehensive NCLEX Review book that is sold to the public and can be purchased on Amazon. 42

Proctored Exams

Plaintiff expends substantial resources to develop its proctored exams. They are stored in ATI's secure servers at a secure
third-party data center facility. Access to Plaintiff's facilities is restricted by keycard access and keycards are only provided to
employees and/or consultants that have signed agreements containing strict non-disclosure and confidentiality provisions.
ATI rigorously protects the confidentiality of its proctored exams in order to maintain its competitive edge.

Plaintiff's proctored exams are administered in a secure testing environment. Students are prohibited from bringing into the
testing center any electronic devices or personal electronics. Students are only permitted to bring into the testing center an
ATl-provided calculator, number two pencils, and scratch paper. Students taking the ATI proctored exams are presented
with the following confidentiality terms that are conspicuously displayed on a screen prior to beginning the exam:

All assessment questions are the copyrighted property of Assessment Technologies Institute®, LLC. The
removal or attempt to remove questions or other assessment material from the test site is prohibited. It is
forbidden under federal copyright law to copy, reproduce, record, distribute, or disclose these assessment
questions by any means, in whole or in part. A violation of this type can result in civil and criminal penalties. 4+

Students are required to check an ""| agree"" box next to these terms.
The proctored exams are supervised by a proctor. The proctor remains present
[588 F.Supp.3d 1195]

during the entire test administration. Proctors must adhere to an ATI Proctor Process Script and review and agree to an ATI
Proctor Oath. There are eligibility requirements that a person must meet before becoming an ATI Proctor. Before the test,
proctors remind test takers of their obligation to keep confidential any information contained in the exam and that they may
not discuss the contents of the proctored exam outside the testing center. Proctors remind test takers that unauthorized
disclosure of any information on the proctored exam is subject to penalty and legal damages. Plaintiff trains proctors to
monitor and report any instances of unauthorized disclosure of proctored exam information.

Plaintiff creates its proctored exams through substantial review in collaboration with experts to ensure that the subject matter
presented is accurately tested. The proctored exams assess the proficiency of nursing students for accreditation as nursing
professionals. They test student knowledge of nursing topics, including concepts that appear on the NCLEX. Each question
presented on an ATI proctored exam is written by Plaintiff's employees or consultants. Each ATI proctored exam question
also undergoes psychometric evaluation before being included.

Practice Exams

Plaintiff also produces practice exams for each of the ATI proctored exam topics. According to Dr. Jerry Gorham, the Chief
Measurement and Testing Officer at ATI, the purpose of the practice exams ""is to give the student a flavor for the kind of
content they're going to see on a proctored exam, give them a sense for the kind—the topic areas they're going to
encounter, have them become comfortable with formats."" 42 The practice exams at issue in this case were registered with
the Copyright Office. Like the ATI proctored exams, ATI practice exams are original works created by ATI through intensive
collaboration of ATI educational, nursing, and test development experts to ensure that relevant topics and sub-topics are
accurately, adequately, and proportionately tested in a unique and non-biased manner.

The process for creating, developing, reviewing, editing, and finalizing items for ATI practice exams is substantially similar to
the process described above for the ATI proctored exams. However, practice exams are not proctored or monitored and can
be accessed from any location through ATI's secure online portal. When students take the practice exams, they are not
prevented from taking notes that can be studied later. According to Plaintiff's records, many of the practice exams have
been accessed thousands of times. 42

ATI Terms and Conditions


--- Page 5 ---
Nursing students enrolled with Plaintiff's nursing school clients generally have access to its products—the review modules,
practice exams, and proctored exams—through its online portal, which is available to students who have registered for an
ATI account through affiliation with their nursing school. Before creating an account with ATI, students must review and
affirmatively accept ATI's Terms and Conditions. Users can only access Plaintiff's products, including the practice exams, by
clicking a box indicating ""Yes, | Agree"" next to the following language: ""| have read and understand the ATI Terms and
Conditions, and agree to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and policies described therein, including, but not limited to,
the following specific consents."" 4

[588 F.Supp.3d 1196]

The Terms and Conditions include the following provisions: (a) ""You agree to use ATI Products and ATI Services only as
permitted under this Agreement""; (b) ""You agree that ... you will not disclose any portion of ATI Products to any other person
or entity""; and (c) ""[y]ou agree not to copy ... or create any derivative works of or based on the ATI Products."" 45

Defendant's Use of ATI Materials

Defendant attended California State University-San Marcos (""CSUSM"") from January 2013 through December 2015 in the
Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing program. At CSUSM, one specific type of ATI proctored exam, the ATI
Comprehensive Predictor Exam, is administered before a student may take the NCLEX. Students in this program must
achieve a minimum requisite score in order to sit for the NCLEX. If a student fails to achieve the minimum passing score on
the ATI Proctored Exam three times, that student cannot sit for that year's administration of the NCLEX. Instead, the student
must wait until the next NCLEX administration the following year. Accordingly, at the CSUSM nursing program, achieving a
minimum requisite score on the ATI proctored exams is required for nursing licensure.

While in nursing school, Defendant tutored her fellow classmates with new and difficult nursing concepts. Defendant
received the 2013 ATI Review Modules in early 2013 as part of the mandatory ATI package that all students at her school
had to purchase. After graduation, but before October 2018, Defendant purchased the 2016 ATI Review Modules on
Amazon, with the exception of the RN Pharmacology for Nursing Edition 7.0, which she purchased on January 26, 2019.

As a student at CSUSM, Defendant created an ATI account. Defendant first accepted ATI's Terms and Conditions in 2013 at
the time she created her student account. Defendant accessed the practice exams and proctored exams while a student
enrolled at CSUSM. She took three different administrations of the ATI proctored exam in 2015. Each administration of the
ATI proctored exam followed the standard secure procedure that applies to all of ATI's proctored exams. A CSUSM faculty
member proctored all of the ATI proctored exams Defendant took in 2015 under strict protocols to make sure students did
not take notes or take anything out of the exam room. Defendant took at least 230 ATI Practice Exams while she was a
student at CSUSM.

Defendant eventually graduated at the top of her class from CSUSM with a 4.0 GPA. She has worked as a practicing nurse
for a cumulative five years since graduation, currently working as a part-time wound-care nurse. After graduating from the
CSUSM program in December 2015, Defendant accessed ATI practice exams through her ATI account on at least 43
occasions. She did this ""so that [she] could brush up on [her] knowledge in the various nursing subject areas in order to
more effectively teach students the key concepts they needed to know."" 48 Defendant testified during her deposition that she
took the tests after graduation in order to refresh her knowledge and explain the nursing concepts well in her YouTube
videos. Defendant did not have access to the proctored exams after graduation.

Defendant accepted ATI's Terms and Conditions on July 24, 2018 at 4:33 p.m. before accessing an ATI practice exam.
[588 F.Supp.3d 1197]

And she accepted ATI's Terms and Conditions again on January 8, 2019 at 8:47 p.m. before logging into her account.

Defendant's Initial Videos and Study Cards

Chief Digital Advisors, LLC (""CDA"") is a California limited liability company that currently does business under the name
""Level UP RN."" Defendant's husband, Bill Parkes, is the Chief Executive Officer and Defendant is the Chief Educator at
CDA. CDA used the name ""Pass the ATI"" until October 2018.

In 2017, Defendant created nursing tutorial videos that were posted to a ""Pass the ATI"" YouTube Channel. 42 The following
video playlists were posted: (1) Community Health Nursing, (2) Nursing Fundamentals, (3) Nursing Leadership, (4) Maternal
Newborn, (5) Medical Surgical Nursing, (6) Mental Health Nursing, (7) Nutrition for Nursing, and (8) Pharmacology for
Nursing. Defendant explained the purpose of her initial videos as follows:

[Mly goal with this [YouTube channel] is to go through each of the ATI books and my plan is to do them all ... and
go over all of the main points and the things that ATI seems to focus on and like[s] to ask questions about so it
helps kind of streamline your studying to the most important things. 48

In the first video of each playlist, Defendant stated that she used ATI's review module books to create the videos in each
playlist—she held up the hard copy edition of the ATI review module that she planned to cover during that playlist. In four of
the eight videos, she stated that the 2013 and 2016 editions of ATI's review modules were very similar and that the audience
could follow along with either version. For these initial videos, Defendant ""used the ATI modules and made notes alongside


--- Page 6 ---
highlighted facts with her tricks/hints for remembering the information. Then she would make the videos, explaining the
highlighted facts and her tricks/hints as she went through the modules, giving attribution to ATI."" 42

Defendant discussed in the initial videos information she learned from taking practice exams. For example, she states in one
video:

So, just as with all the other books, ATI may ask you questions about anything in these books, and sometimes
they ask you stuff that's actually not in these books. I'm just gonna try to focus on some of the key concepts that
I've seen in a lot of the practice tests and in the tests I've taken with ATI in the past. 52

Defendant admits that she included information in her initial videos based on the questions she saw on ATI's practice
exams. 51

Defendant created ""Pass the ATI""-branded study cards that were posted at the URL, www.passtheati.com. In May 2018,
CDA began selling Defendant's study cards on this website with its first set, Pharmacology for Nursing Students. By October
12, 2018, the following four sets of study cards were offered for sale on the website: Pharmacology for Nursing Students,
Community Health Nursing Cards, Nutrition for Nursing, and Nursing Fundamentals.

[588 F.Supp.3d 1198]

Defendant used both the 2013 and 2016 ATI Review Modules to create her study cards, in addition to other sources
including nursing school textbooks, nursing school notes, her experience as a practicing nurse, and various online sources.
82 For each study card deck, Defendant ""ordered the topics in a way that allowed students to ‘roughly’ follow along with their
ATI books."" 53For the first two study card decks, she ""built out this content in a Word document before moving it to a PDF,""
but ""[flor most decks, she entered information directly into a PDF file."" 54 Defendant created the study card files with the
corresponding ATI Review Modules in front of her, for the purpose of sending the document to her third-party printer to have
the study cards made. Defendant admits she used some ""very similar examples"" to ATI in order to illustrate certain nursing
concepts in her study cards, but that ""as soon as [she] was alerted that that was not okay, then [she] took them out right
away."" 55

ATI's Review of Defendant's Products

Jeff Marsh is the Director of Test Security for Plaintiff, and he supervises Karen Wood, the Test Security Administrator.
Plaintiff's Test Security Team monitors the Internet to find material that is substantially similar to ATI's intellectual property,
and locates improper disclosure of Plaintiff's proctored exam material.

The Test Security Team received several reports about Defendant's YouTube videos from nursing school and student
customers between April and October 2018. Wood reviewed five or six videos posted by Defendant before responding to the
first report on April 4, 2018, explaining that ""[t]he videos from Cathy Parkes are—fortunately—not a violation of ATI
intellectual property. In the videos she goes over information in various chapters of ATI's Study Materials, which is
considered fair use. They're kind of like Cliffs Notes.... [T]here's also no security risk."" 5&

The Test Security Team received another report about Defendant's YouTube videos from a nursing school customer on May
21, 2018. This customer was concerned that its students were scoring higher on the proctored exams after watching
Defendant's videos, and requested that Plaintiff conduct a psychometric review of the school's proctored exams to see if the
instructors’ concerns had any merit. Wood responded by email the next day, copying Marsh:

I'm familiar with the youtube videos and have investigated them in the past. The wom[aJn in the videos is merely
going over information that's in our Review Modules, so there's no real benefit that a student couldn't obtain by
using the Review Modules themselves. She's a good tool for students to use, so the scores could possibly be
because of her.

There's nothing she's doing that constitutes copyright or IP infringement, she's providing a service much like

Cliffs Notes which is considered fair use since she's not saying she's ATI or even using significant portions of our
materials. So if students want to use her as a source, they're actually smart for doing that.

[Redacted] 52

Marsh performed a statistical analysis on that school's test scores and determined that the ""data has come back ‘clean,’
which indicates to us that the testers had a legitimate understanding of the material."" 58

[588 F.Supp.3d 1199]
Marsh found no evidence of cheating or other impropriety.

The Test Security Team received another report about Defendant's YouTube videos on June 26, 2018, this time from ATI
employee Michael Hux. Wood responded the same day:

This is a youtuber we're aware of. Her videos are just her going through our review modules giving helpful
information/tips/etc. She's not sharing information that's on our proctored assessments or violating any copyright


--- Page 7 ---
infringement. It's just like if someone used Cliff's Notes to study for a test. 52

On August 10, 2018, Agnes Di Stasi, an ATI Nurse Education Account Executive told a nursing school customer that
Defendant's YouTube videos are protected by fair use law and that ATI cannot legally have the videos removed. DiStasi also
told this customer that she had never had a student who clearly remembered the items on an assessment two or three year
after taking it. 82

On September 5, 2018, in response to a nursing student's report about Defendant's YouTube videos, Wood stated that ""
[t]his youtuber is only reviewing our Review Modules and we have no reason to believe she's doing anything wrong. It's just
like a Cliff's Notes situation."" &

On September 7, 2018, in response to a nursing customer's report about Defendant's YouTube videos, Jamie Fiorucci-
Hughes, Chief of Staff/Vice President of Operations, Clinical Health for ATI's parent company, stated that ""we had our test
security team review and they indicated there is nothing copywritten in her videos and that they are primarily study tips so
we have no problem with students using them if they are helpful."" £2

That same day, ATI received an inquiry from a nursing school administrator asking if Defendant's YouTube videos were
authorized. Wood responded on September 10 to the ATI employee who received the inquiry, stating:

The person who made the videos is not associated with ATI and is not endorsed by ATI, but there's nothing
illegal or actionable about what she's doing. It's just like Cliff's Notes: she's reviewing the books and giving people
helpful tips on studying. As long as she's not presenting herself as us (she's not) or giving information on our
proctored assessments (again, she's not) then she's within her rights due to ""fair use."" §3

Wood forwarded her email to Marsh and Becky Pontes in the legal department.

Wood sent two other emails on September 19 and 28, 2018, respectively, to fellow ATI employees who inquired about
Defendant's YouTube videos, advising them that they are not a problem, and are ""like Cliff's Notes."" 4 In the September 28
email, Wood stated that the legal department was planning to ask Defendant to change the name of the website and post a
disclaimer.

ATI Challenges Defendant's Use of ATI Trademarks
On September 6, 2018, ATI employee Kendra Darigan was instructed by someone at ATI to purchase three sets of study
[588 F.Supp.3d 1200]

cards from the ""passtheati"" website, and she complied. On October 12, 2018, Pontes sent a cease-and-desist email to
Defendant with the subject line ""Trademark Infringement"" that was approved by Christine Erickson, in-house counsel for
ATI:

It has recently come to my attention that you have created a website, www.passtheati.com, in which you provide
some of the same, or similar services as ATI. In addition, you are using ATI Trademarks on many social media
sites, including, but not limited to, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. As you may be aware, using a registered
trademark in a manner other than fair use constitutes trademark infringement. Your use of ATI Trademarks
clearly infringe upon ATI's intellectual property rights as ATI did not authorize, consent to, or grant permission to
you to use ATI Trademarks in any manner. Your continued and unauthorized use of ATI Trademarks in a manner
other than fair use, may constitute unfair competition, intentional trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and
unjust enrichment, and seems to be an attempt to confuse consumers by misleading them into believing you are
affiliated with, or endorsed by, ATI.

As you can assume, ATI places the highest priority on its reputation and intellectual property rights and will act
zealously to protect its interests. Therefore, we expect that you will appreciate our concerns and resolve this
matter immediately. ©

Defendant forwarded the email to Bill Parkes on October 15, 2018, who responded to Pontes on October 16. His email
states in part:

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We had no intention whatsoever of creating consumer confusion of
any kind. This is not our area of expertise and we were not aware that this would be an issue.

We have already begun making changes and will do so at best speed so that we can address your concerns so
as to remove any potential confusion this may have created in the marketplace.

We have already removed ‘Pass The ATI’ from the banner image on our website yesterday and are in the
process of renaming and rebranding our Instagram, Facebook and YouTube presence. &

By October 18, 2018, Bill Parkes rebranded the www.passtheati.com website to the domain name www.leveluprn.com, and
included a footer on the new website disclaiming any affiliation between ATI and Level Up RN. Pontes emailed Bill Parkes
on October 19 that ""[t]he footnote on the website looks good,"" and that she would try to call him that morning. &2 That same


--- Page 8 ---
day, Bill Parkes spoke to Pontes on the phone for 15 to 30 minutes. Bill Parkes took contemporaneous notes during the
phone call indicating that Pontes told him: (1) ATI believed that Defendant was helping students greatly; (2) ATI knew that
Defendant was not using ATI's content; (3) ATI thought what Defendant was doing was ""awesome""; (4) Defendant taught to
the curriculum and not the tests; (5) ATI had reviewed the study cards and had no copyright concerns; (6) Pontes had
listened to a dozen of Defendant's videos and thought Defendant was ""great"" and ATI would love to have her as an
instructor; (7) after ATI started looking at Defendant's work product, it concluded that Defendant was helping people and it
was ""wonderful""; (8) Pontes loved the new name, Level Up

[588 F.Supp.3d 1201]
RN; (9) ATI did not see any copyright issues; and (10) he should tell his wife that she is doing a ""fantastic job."" $8

After this call, Bill Parkes copied his notes into a text message and sent them to Defendant. Defendant responded that she
was relieved to hear that ATI did not have any concerns with the content she had created. Defendant had no prior
experience with copyright issues, nor contrary advice from a lawyer or anyone else that they were violating any of ATI's
copyrights or improperly disclosing test information. Defendant felt ""exceedingly confident,"" based on the positive feedback
Bill Parkes had communicated to her from Pontes, ""that we were doing the right thing and doing so with the full support of,
and validation from, ATI."" 2

Bill Parkes did not hear from Pontes again until December 3, 2018, when she notified him by email that Level Up RN's
Privacy Policy, Terms of Services, and YouTube channel still included references to ""Pass the ATI,"" and she requested that
he remove them. Her email indicated that ""various customers ... think the website is somehow affiliated with ATI and/or
violating copyrights."" 22 Bill Parkes replied to Pontes on the same day to inform her that he had removed the remaining
references to ATI in the Privacy Policy and Terms of Services—he had missed those references in the initial rebranding. He
further noted that he had reviewed the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service on CDA's YouTube channel and had not found
any references to ATI. He requested that Pontes ""let me know where any reference remains on YouTube."" 2 After
December 3, 2018, Bill Parkes did not receive any further communications from Pontes. Pontes kept Erickson apprised of
her communications with Bill Parkes.

After changing the name of the business to Level Up RN, Defendant created for sale the following sets of study cards under
the Level UP RN brand: (1) Nursing Fundamentals, (2) Nutrition for Nursing, (3) Community Health Nursing, (4)
Pharmacology for Nursing, (5) Pediatric Nursing, (6) Mental Health Nursing, (7) Medical Surgical Nursing, (8) Nursing
Leadership, and (9) Maternal Newborn Nursing. For sets originally branded ""Pass the ATI,"" the only change Defendant
made before selling them under the Level Up RN brand was to change the branding from Pass the ATI to Level Up RN
—""content-wise they were all the same before and after the rebrand."" “2 Defendant also created approximately 90 additional
videos that were posted on Level Up RN's YouTube channel. During that same time period, CDA invested over $900,000 in
creating, marketing, advertising, selling, and fulfilling orders for the study card decks Defendant created. Defendant spent
hundreds of hours creating these additional study cards and videos.

2019 Customer Reports About Level Up RN's Products

By February 2019, Wood still had only reviewed five or six of Defendant's videos. She continued to field questions from ATI
customers about Defendant's videos. On January 17, January 28, and February 5, 2019, Wood wrote internal emails
indicating that she reviewed ""many of the videos"" and characterized them as fair use. In her January 28 email, Wood stated
that ""[nJothing myself nor Legal has found indicates Cathy Parkes’ videos are anything other than good study tools."" 2 She
indicated

[588 F.Supp.3d 1202]

that the analytics ""we performed"" on one of the topic areas did not reveal ""group preknowledge"" that would be ""suspect."" 24
She also stated that ""we've already examined"" the study cards ""and they're general nursing notes."" 5

Other ATI employees relayed similar findings to customers who inquired about Defendant's products. Kristi Burgess
responded to a customer's email on December 4, 2018, that ""Our Legal and Security teams are both aware. As of now, they
are not violating copyright, but we are monitoring closely."" 22On February 7, 2019, Fiorucci-Hughes responded to an email
from a customer stating: ""Legal has determined that what she covers is simply test taking strategies and content areas not
copyright infringement.... Watching Cathy's video's [sic] would have no impact on student proficiency level outside of
understanding ways to prepare."" “ The next day, Fiorucci-Hughes sent a similar email to another customer.

Marsh also sent several internal emails explaining that the legal team had reviewed the videos and could not find that they
were infringing, or exposed ATI content that gave students an advantage on the proctored exams. For example, on May 6,
2019, Marsh sent an email to a member of ATI's nursing education department, stating in part:

Last year when we first learned about Cathy, we had our Legal team look at all of her videos, and they could not
find anything infringing upon our Copyrights. At that time, we also had some nursing content experts for ATI look
at the videos, and they determined that they do not take any of our direct content, and they actually are a very
good learning tool for students without giving away any proprietary information.

Since that time last year, we have been monitoring Cathy and watching any new videos that come out, and we
also have contact with her. It was ascertained that her intentions are only to help nursing students study and not


--- Page 9 ---
provide anyone with an unfair advantage. If at any point we notice that this changes, we'll work with the Legal
department to perform the proper actions in relation to her videos or channel.

[Redacted] 28

Four days later, Defendant received a letter from Lawrence Robins, outside counsel for ATI, alleging that her YouTube
videos infringed ATI's copyrights. On behalf of ATI, Robins requested that Defendant ""immediately remove all videos from
your YouTube page and website that contain material taken or derived from ATI's works."" “ Yet, after this letter was sent,
Marsh sent an email to an ATI nursing school customer that there was ""no copyrightable ATI content"" in the videos, and ""
[w]e have determined that she is a fairly good study tool, similar to a test prep company."" £2

Defendant's Revised Videos

On June 27, 2019, Level UP RN removed ""videos of concern"" from its YouTube channel and uploaded over 200 new videos
created by Defendant that do not explicitly reference ATI (""the revised videos""). The revised videos were recorded between
May and September 2019. In these revised videos, Defendant provides

[588 F.Supp.3d 1203]

tips to her viewers about what they will see on their ""exams,"" but omits explicit references to ""ATI"" or ATI's proctored exams.
Instead, she tells the audience to ""definitely remember"" certain facts, or that a certain piece of information was ""important,""
""super important,"" or ""key"" to remember. Defendant created these videos extemporaneously, without a script. By this time,
Defendant did not independently remember any of the proctored exam questions from the exams she took in 2015.

Defendant had been receiving comments on her YouTube channel, including suggestions for topics for her to cover and
users’ ways of remembering information to share with her and her YouTube community. In May or June 2019, Defendant
created a document summarizing these comments, in order to be sure that she covered the suggested topics when she
revised her videos. She used the list to help create her revised videos.

The videos created by Defendant have always been available to the public at no charge. Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on August
27, 2019, alleging claims based on the videos and seven of the nine study card decks Defendant created. On December 9,
2019, after this Court enjoined Defendant from selling these seven study card decks, CDA stopped selling them. By July
2020, CDA stopped selling the other two study decks.

Ill. Discussion

Plaintiff asserts the following claims for relief in this matter: (1) copyright infringement; (2) misappropriation of trade secrets
under the DTSA and the KUTSA,; (3) unfair competition under Kansas law; and (4) breach of contract under Kansas law.
aintiff moves for partial summary judgment on liability as to all claims. Defendant responds that there are genuine issues of
aterial fact on the elements of each claim, and submits evidence in support of several affirmative defenses. Defendant
separately moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's trade secrets claims, the unfair competition claim, and the damages
lement of Plaintiff's breach of contract claim. The Court considers each of Plaintiff's claims in turn before turning to
efendant's affirmative defenses.

D
A. Copyright Infringement
P

jaintiff moves for summary judgment on its copyright infringement claim, which alleges that Plaintiff owns a valid copyright
or its 2013 and 2016 review modules, and that Defendant copied protectable elements of the review modules with her (1)
initial YouTube videos; (2) Level Up RN study cards; and (3) revised YouTube videos. As an initial matter, the Court notes
hat it is not bound by its preliminary injunction finding that Plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim that
Defendant copied the protectable elements of Plaintiff's review modules. The Court addresses this claim anew in light of a
different and more robust record, new legal authority in the Tenth Circuit, 8! arguments raised by the parties in their summary
judgment briefs, and different standards. 82

588 F.Supp.3d 1204]

The elements of a copyright infringement claim are: ""(1) ownership of a valid copyright and (2) ‘copying of constituent
elements of the work that are original.’ "" 3A certificate of registration of a copyright is prima facie evidence of the validity of
he copyright and facts stated in its certificate. &4 It is uncontroverted that ATI owns valid copyright registrations for its 2013
and 2016 review modules, and Defendant concedes that Plaintiff has established this element as a matter of law. 85

But Defendant challenges whether Plaintiff can establish the second element of its copyright infringement claim. To prove
his second element, Plaintiff must demonstrate both ""(1) that [Defendant], as a factual matter, copied portions of [Plaintiff's]
work; and (2) that those elements of the work that were copied were ‘protected expression and of such importance to the
copied work that the appropriation is actionable.’ "" 86 Plaintiff maintains that the evidence demonstrates Defendant copied its
review modules, and that the material copied from the review modules constitutes original, protected expression. Defendant
responds that there are genuine issues of material fact on these issues that preclude summary judgment.

1. Factual Copying


--- Page 10 ---
To prove factual copying, Plaintiff must demonstrate that Defendant copied portions of its review modules through direct or
indirect proof. 8? Direct evidence is ""evidence, which if believed, proves the existence of a fact in issue without inference or
presumption."" 88 While ""[d]irect proof of copying is often hard to come by,"" a plaintiff can indirectly prove copying ""by
establishing that Defendant[ ] had access to the copyrighted work and that there are probative similarities between the
copyrighted material and the allegedly copied material."" 82

Plaintiff argues that there is direct, uncontroverted evidence of copying because Defendant admitted using the review
modules in the initial videos themselves, encouraging her viewers to follow along with their review modules, and during
discovery admitted using her highlighted copies of the ATI review modules to make the initial videos and study cards.
Defendant responds that notwithstanding these admissions, there is a genuine issue of material fact about whether she
""copied"" the material because she ""jumped around"" to cover only material she believed was important, and she added her
own material, including tips, tricks, and hints for remembering certain information. Plaintiff also offers evidence

[588 F.Supp.3d 1205]

of Plaintiff's highlighted copies of the review modules, which she admitted to using as a template while she prepared her
study cards. The Court agrees that there is strong evidence of factual copying given Defendant's admissions, but need not
resolve whether there is a genuine issue of material fact on this issue. As described below, assuming Plaintiff can establish
factual copying as a matter of law, it cannot demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact about whether
Defendant copied the protected expression in Plaintiff's review modules.

2. Protected Expression

To establish the protected expression component of the second element of Plaintiff's copyright claim, ""a court must
determine (1) which elements of the copyrighted work are protectable, and (2) whether these elements are substantially
similar to the accused work."" 2° This component is a mixed question of law and fact and determines whether a defendant's
factual copying constitutes actionable copyright infringement. 21

a. Protectable Elements—Compilation

Plaintiff asserts that its review modules are protected as compilations. Under the Copyright Act, a ""compilation"" is defined as
""a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected, coordinated, or
arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship."" 92 As the Tenth Circuit
recently explained: ""This definition contains the following three criteria: ‘(1) the collection and assembly of pre-existing
material, facts, or data; (2) the selection, coordination, or arrangement of those materials; and (3) the creation, by virtue of
the particular selection, coordination, or arrangement, of an “original” work of authorship.’ "" 28

To meet the third criteria of a compilation, Plaintiff's selection, coordination, or arrangement of nursing facts ""must be (1)
original and (2) a work of authorship."" 24 Defendant argues that Plaintiff's arrangement of nursing facts is not original. The
originality requirement involves the compiler's ""choices as to selection and arrangement, so long as they are made
independently ... and entail a minimum degree of creativity."" 25 It is the compiler's choices of ""which facts to include, in what
order to place them, and how to arrange the collected data so that they may be used effectively by readers"" that are
protected, so long as they are sufficiently original. 22 The Supreme Court has explained the originality requirement for a
compilation as follows:

A compiler may settle upon a selection or arrangement that others have used; novelty is not required. Originality
requires only that the author make the selection or arrangement independently ( i.e. , without copying that
selection or arrangement from another work), and that it display some minimal level of creativity. Presumably, the
vast majority

[588 F.Supp.3d 1206]
of compilations will pass this test, but not all will. 22

The Court previously determined in its December 9, 2019 Order that Plaintiff curated, digested, and presented nursing facts
in a unique way while retaining the accuracy of the underlying public information. The summary judgment record reaffirms
this finding. On this record, it is uncontroverted that the selection, organization, and arrangement of nursing information in
each ATI review module was developed by many ATI employees across different ATI departments. While the underlying
nursing facts in the review modules are not protectable, Plaintiff's choice of which facts to include, the order in which to
include them, and how they are arranged are original. Defendant points to no evidence demonstrating that Plaintiff copied
the exact selection and arrangement of its nursing facts from another source or that there is but one way to arrange and
collect the nursing facts covered by the review modules. 28 Thus, the review modules are an original work of authorship and
qualify as a compilation.

However, Plaintiff's ""protectable expression is ‘limited to the selection, coordination, and/or arrangement of that specific
content, and [does] not apply to the format and layout itself."" 22 For this reason, Defendant correctly asserts that the
protection associated with Plaintiff's review modules, which are indisputably fact-based works, is ""thin."" 122s the Supreme
Court has explained, this is because


--- Page 11 ---
a subsequent compiler remains free to use the facts contained in another's publication to aid in preparing a
competing work, so long as the competing work does not feature the same selection and arrangement... ""[T]he
very same facts and ideas may be divorced from the context imposed by the author, and restated or reshuffled
by second comers, even if the author was the first to discover the facts or to propose the ideas."" 101

The extent to which Defendant copied Plaintiff's protectable expression—its organization, selection, and arrangement of
nursing facts—is at the center of the parties’

[588 F.Supp.3d 1207]

dispute in this case. The finder of fact must determine whether Defendant's videos and study cards feature the particular
selection and arrangement of nursing facts that Plaintiff used in the review modules, or, instead, whether Defendant only
copied raw facts and ""restated and reshuffled"" them in such a way that is distinguishable from the review modules. To
determine whether Defendant copied not just raw facts, but the specific selection and arrangement of nursing facts used by
Plaintiff, the Court next turns to the second part of the protected expression inquiry—whether the two works are
substantially similar.

b. Substantial Similarity

Substantial similarities are present where ""the accused work is so similar to the plaintiffs work that an ordinary reasonable
person would conclude that the defendant unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff's protectible expression by taking material of
substance and value."" 1°2 In a compilation case, "" ‘the court must compare the allegedly infringing work as a whole’ when
determining whether the two works are substantially similar."" 128 The Tenth Circuit cautions against breaking the compilation
up into protected and unprotected elements when undertaking this inquiry. 44

Plaintiff urges that the following evidence demonstrates substantial similarity: (1) Defendant uses the same organization,
structure, and arrangement of nursing facts in her products; (2) Defendant uses many of the same illustrative examples in
her products; (3) the study cards use similar phraseology, word choice, titles, and groupings of facts; (4) Defendant used the
review modules as a template and guide when creating her initial videos; and (5) Defendant used her study cards to create
the revised videos.

Defendant responds that her products contain substantial differences in the selection, organization, and sequence of
material as compared to the review modules. She also maintains that the nursing facts included in the review modules are
presented in a standard order and structure used by all nursing textbooks, and that the nine subjects organized by ATI are
standard subject areas of nursing facts. Defendant further asserts that she used many sources to create the study cards,
including the review modules, and that many of the nursing facts in her study cards are also included in the other research
sources she used. Finally, Defendant maintains that the illustrative examples Plaintiff claims were copied are not unique or
original to

[588 F.Supp.3d 1208]
ATI, and are instead standard illustrative examples.

As described below, the Court finds there is a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of substantial similarity. To be
sure, there is uncontroverted evidence that Defendant utilized the same subject areas as the review modules when creating
her products, and that she used several of the same illustrative examples for nursing facts as the review modules. But it is
controverted whether, when the compilations are viewed as a whole, Defendant's organization, arrangement, selection of
nursing facts, and copying of illustrative examples demonstrate substantial similarity.

i. Organization, Structure, and Arrangement

Like Plaintiff's review modules, Defendant's study cards and videos are divided into nine broad subject areas. And
Defendant named her nine subject areas the same as or substantially similar to Plaintiff's review modules. Defendant
explicitly stated in her initial videos that she organized her videos so that the viewer could follow along with the review
modules. However, a reasonable jury could determine that the structure and arrangement of nursing facts within these
subject areas are not substantially similar. Plaintiffs products are textbooks containing highly detailed information.
Defendant's products are videos and study cards that contain far less detail, and are designed to be used as quick study
tools for exams.

Moreover, Defendant offers evidence of differences in organization and sequence. The first comparison offered by Plaintiff,
Unit 2-Chapter 7 in the Pharmacology review module, is instructive and representative. Defendant created six study cards
by allegedly copying information in this chapter dealing with medications for anxiety, trauma, and stressor-related disorders.
While Plaintiff organized these medications by body system and then disorder, Defendant organized by body system and
then drug class, creating one card for each of six drug classes covered in this review module chapter. 122 The front of each
card contains the name of the category and type of medication (e.g., Anxiety and Depression, SSRIs), and the back of each
card lists the names of the medications, and information such as ""indications,"" ""mode of action,"" ""side effects,"" and ""key
points."" 1°6 The information on the back of each card is brief, often in list form. A reasonable jury could conclude that these
are more than ""minor"" differences in structure and arrangement, as urged by Plaintiff, and that they weigh against a finding
of substantial similarity.


--- Page 12 ---
Defendant's initial videos contain more information than the study cards, but still less information than the review modules,
and there is a genuine issue of material fact about the similarities between the products’ substructures. For example, while
Defendant utilized some of the substructure of the Fundamentals for Nursing review module in her Nursing Fundamental
videos, she skipped over a large swath of information, and retitled several chapters to emphasize facts she wanted to cull
out and emphasize. The Fundamentals of Nursing review module contains 42 chapters, yet Defendant created only 24
Nursing Fundamentals videos that skipped over much of ATI's subject matter, and that did not replicate ATI's naming
conventions. 122

[588 F.Supp.3d 1209]

It is also controverted that Defendant's videos follow the same order as the review modules. Defendant offers evidence that
her study cards eliminate repetition from the review modules, and reorder nursing facts in certain sections. 128A reasonable
jury could conclude that Defendant's omissions and changes in sequence weigh against a finding of substantial similarity.

The basis for Plaintiff's argument that the revised videos are infringing is that Defendant relies on her study cards. For the
reasons discussed above, the Court finds a genuine issue of material fact about whether the revised videos, which are
based on the study cards, are substantially similar to the organization, structure, and arrangement of nursing facts in
Plaintiff's review modules.

ii. Selection of Nursing Facts

Next, Plaintiff maintains there is no genuine issue of material fact that Defendant copied Plaintiff's selection of nursing facts
when she created her products. As already discussed in the context of organization, structure, and arrangement,
Defendant's products do not include the level of detail included in Plaintiff's review modules, and she omitted entire chapters
of information from the review modules in her products. This was deliberate—Defendant attests that she set out to create
products that contained only the key facts for nursing students to learn while studying for their nursing exams, including tips,
tricks, and mnemonic devices. Defendant also offers evidence that she used not only the review modules, but many other
sources of nursing facts to create her products, including her own nursing experience and other nursing textbooks. 122

The parties each offer numerous lengthy exhibits comparing and highlighting the similarities and differences between the
content of their products. And the Court can confirm upon reviewing these exhibits that there are both similarities and
differences in the selection of nursing facts. However, the Court is mindful that any side-by-side comparison of these
products must be tempered by the Tenth Circuit's direction to compare them as a whole, a task in which neither party
sufficiently engaged in their briefs. 112 Accordingly, the Court finds that the extent to which Defendant selected the same
nursing facts as Plaintiff did in its review modules, when viewed as a whole, is a genuine issue of material fact.

iii. Illustrative Examples
Finally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant's use of several of the same illustrative
[588 F.Supp.3d 1210]

examples utilized by Plaintiff in its review modules establishes substantial similarity. The Court previously found at the
preliminary injunction phase that Defendant's copying of these examples was highly probative of substantial similarity
because they constitute part of the ""selection"" of nursing facts that is protected as part of Plaintiff's compilation. But in
opposition to summary judgment, Defendant submits detailed information about all of these examples, explaining why she
chose the examples she did and identifying other sources that include the same examples. 1‘'In many instances, Defendant
maintains that she merely used examples for certain concepts that are the most commonly used examples in the field. Thus,
she maintains that the examples are not unique to ATI. Moreover, Defendant attests that she used many examples that
were different from examples used by ATI. Given this competing evidence, Defendant's use of some of the same examples
utilized by Plaintiff in the review modules is not sufficient to meet Plaintiff's substantial summary judgment burden as the
moving party that bears the burden of proof at trial.

In sum, the Court finds that even if it assumes that Defendant engaged in factual copying of Plaintiff's review modules when
she created her videos and study cards, there is a genuine issue of material fact about whether she copied Plaintiff's
protected expression. A reasonable jury could conclude that the many differences between the two works prohibit a finding
that Defendant's products are so similar to the review modules that an ordinary person would conclude that she unlawfully
appropriated Plaintiff's original organization, selection, and arrangement of nursing facts when viewed as a whole. Because
a reasonable jury could determine that ""the accused work is [not] so similar to the plaintiffs work that an ordinary reasonable
person would conclude that the defendant unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff's protectible expression by taking material of
substance and value,"" 1""? Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on its copyright infringement claim must be denied.

3. Derivative Works
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's initial videos, revised videos, and study cards also violate Plaintiff's exclusive right to
prepare derivative works based on its review modules under 17 U.S.C. § 106(2). That provision states in relevant part that

""the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights ... to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted
work."" 113 A derivative work is:

a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,


--- Page 13 ---
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other
form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions,
annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a
""derivative work"". 114

Plaintiff spends no time in its brief acknowledging the definition of derivative work or explaining why, as a matter of law,
Defendant's products constitute derivative works. This alone requires the Court to deny summary judgment. Moreover,
whether Defendant's products

[588 F.Supp.3d 1211]

""transformed, adapted or recast the original work into a new and different one"" is a genuine issue of material fact for many of
the same reasons outlined above. 1'5 Defendant has come forward with evidence that she used many sources, including her
own experience, to create her products and that, to the extent she relied on the review modules, she relied only on their
nonprotectable elements. For these reasons, summary judgment is denied on Plaintiff's derivative works copyright
infringement claim.

B. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets

The parties cross-move for summary judgment on Counts 3 and 4, which allege misappropriation of trade secrets under the
DTSA and KUTSA. The elements required to establish this claim are almost identical under the two statutes: (1) existence of
a trade secret; (2) the acquisition, use, or disclosure of the trade secret without consent; and (3) that the individual acquiring,
using, or disclosing the trade secret knew or should have known the trade secret was acquired by improper means. 1/8
""Under the DTSA, the trade secret must also ‘relate[ ] to a product or service used in, or intended for use in, interstate or
foreign commerce.’ "" “2 The Court considers below the first two elements of Plaintiff's misappropriation of trade secrets
claim as applied to the proctored exams and practice exams. Because these two elements are dispositive, the Court need
not separately address the knowledge element.

1. Existence of a Trade Secret

Plaintiff claims that its proctored exams and practice exams are trade secrets. Trade secrets under the DTSA are ""all forms
and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information"" if the owner takes ""reasonable
measures to keep such information secret"" and ""the information derives independent economic value ... from [that
information] not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, another person.""
118 Similarly, under the KUTSA, a trade secret

means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process,
that:

(i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being
readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or
use, and

(ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. 112

Whether a trade secret exists is a question for the trier of fact. 122 The proponent of the claim must come forward with some
evidence showing that the information alleged to be a trade secret meets the definition. 121

a. Proctored Exams
Defendant argues that the proctored exams are not trade secrets because
[588 F.Supp.3d 1212]

they constitute nursing facts and concepts that are generally known or reasonably ascertainable through legitimate means.
Specifically, Defendant urges that the same nursing facts are available through the publicly available review modules and
practice exams. The Court finds no genuine issue of material fact about whether the proctored exams, as defined by Plaintiff,
are trade secrets.

First, Defendant's assertion that ATI makes its practice exams available online to the public without first establishing an ATI
account and agreeing to certain terms and conditions is not supported by the summary judgment record. The Court finds no
evidence that the practice exams are generally available to the public. 122 Although some of ATI's quizzes are available for
purchase, it is uncontroverted that the practice exams can only be accessed by account holders who first agree to ATI's
Terms and Conditions, which include nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions. And Defendant's comparison chart
between the allegedly misappropriated proctored exam test items and practice exam test items do not reflect that they are
identical. Therefore, even if the proctored exams questions Defendant allegedly misappropriated are asked in a similar way
on the practice exam, it does not take away from the protected status of the proctored exam test items.

Second, Plaintiff does not claim that the nursing facts within its proctored exams constitute trade secrets; it claims that the
exams themselves are trade secrets. While it is true that the proctored exams test students on their understanding of


--- Page 14 ---
nursing facts, Defendant wholly fails to support her claim that the proctored exams themselves are publicly available.
Plaintiff claims trade secret protection in ""the specific test items on the ATI Proctored Exams, i.e. , the specific combinations
of questions and answers , and the presentation of those question/answer sets, in the ATI Proctored Exams."" 123 Defendant
offers no evidence that the allegedly misappropriated questions and answers from the proctored exams are published in
either the review modules or the practice exams.

The uncontroverted facts establish that Plaintiff maintains security controls regarding the storage of its proctored exam
materials and regarding the use and administration of its proctored exam in a controlled testing environment, that students
who sit for administrations of the exam must expressly agree to the ATI Proctored Exam Terms that prohibit disclosure of
any information contained within the proctored exam, and that test takers must agree to ATI's Terms and Conditions, which
prohibit use of any information contained in the proctored exams, for any purpose other than those allowed under those ATI
Terms and Conditions.

Moreover, it is uncontroverted that proctors undergo training regarding the proper procedures to administer the exam and
are required to review and agree to the ATI Proctor Oath. It is uncontroverted that the setting within the testing room itself is
controlled and that proctors must remain present during the entire test administration. It is uncontroverted that proctors
enforce rules regarding test administration, including restricting the use of any unauthorized electronic device, restricting the
items that students may take

[588 F.Supp.3d 1213]

into the testing center, and monitoring and reporting any instances of unauthorized disclosure of ATI's proctored exam
information. These uncontroverted facts establish as a matter of law that Plaintiff's proctored exams—the specific test items
—are trade secrets under the DTSA and Kansas law.

b. Practice Exams

Plaintiff recently amended its trade secret claims to add allegations that Defendant misappropriated its practice exams. 124
Specifically, in an interrogatory response submitted toward the end of discovery, Plaintiff identified twelve specific practice
exams that it claims were filed confidentially with the Copyright Office in response to Defendant's request that it identify each
trade secret it claims Defendant disclosed. Defendant argues that the practice exams are not trade secrets because (1) they
were registered with the Copyright Office and are therefore publicly available; and (2) Plaintiff makes them available for sale
without taking sufficient measures to assure the questions and answers remain confidential.

i. Copyright Registration

Defendant first argues that the practice exams are not trade secrets because Plaintiff made them part of the public record
when it deposited them with the Copyright Office at the time of copyright registration. Although it is undisputed that Plaintiff
filed its practice exams with the Copyright Office, the parties dispute whether the practice exams were filed under
regulations governing registration of secure tests, which allows a copyright applicant to maintain the confidentiality of test
materials submitted to the Copyright Office (the ""secure test rule""). 125 As part of its argument that the practice tests were
publicly disclosed when registered with the Copyright Office, Defendant argues that the practice exams would not meet the
definition of secure tests under the 37 C.F.R. § 202.20(b)(4) because they were not administered under supervision at a
specified test center like the proctored exams.

Plaintiff submitted with its reply the declaration of Lawrence Robins, its copyright attorney who registered the practice
exams’ copyrights, stating that he deposited the twelve attached practice exams identified in Plaintiff's earlier interrogatory
response under the secure test rule in 2015. 126 Robins further states that ""[i]n all cases where | have submitted an ATI
Proctored or Practice Exam to the Copyright Office for registration, | have done so under the applicable rules for registering
""Secure Tests"" ... to maintain the confidentiality of ATI's Proctored and Practice Exams."" 122

Defendant's motion for leave to file a surreply on this limited issue is granted for the reasons prescribed by the Court in its
earlier Order denying without prejudice her request to file a surreply. 128 Defendant submitted with her proposed surreply
excerpts from Robins’ deposition, which she urges demonstrates that he lacks personal knowledge about whether the twelve
practice exams were filed as secure tests. Robins’

[588 F.Supp.3d 1214]

declaration is not inadmissible for lack of personal knowledge. Robins represented Plaintiff with respect to the registration of
its copyrighted works since at least 2013. He was and continues to be responsible for registering Plaintiff's proctored and
practice exams. He signed all of the copyright certificates for the twelve practice exams attached to his declaration. Robins
has sufficient personal knowledge to testify about the documents on which his name appears, about his practice with
respect to applying for copyright registration for Plaintiff's products, and about whether he recalls specifically registering
these exams under the secure test rule.

Defendant essentially asks the Court to give Robins’ declaration little weight on the basis of his deposition testimony. To be
sure, Robins testified in the deposition that he does not have a specific recollection of registering the twelve practice exams
at issue, and that he does not ""really recall"" his general procedure for filing under the secure test rule prior to 2018. 122On the
other hand, Robins testified that he is confident that secure test copyrights issued for the practice exams because ""for
purposes of this litigation, | have never filed an application for this client that was not filed under the Secure Test process.""


--- Page 15 ---
130While this witness may not have a specific recollection of reviewing and submitting copyright applications for each of the
twelve specific practice exams in 2015, Defendant provides the Court with no reason to question Robins’ personal
knowledge that all exams he submitted for copyright registration in 2015 were submitted under the secure test rule. The
Court must not weigh the credibility of the witness on summary judgment. A reasonable jury could believe Robins’ testimony
that he filed all exams under the secure test rule, or alternatively, it could disregard his testimony based on his limited
specific recollection as to these twelve tests and the fact that the tests do not meet the definition of secure tests in the
regulation. In the absence of some other documentary evidence showing how the practice exams were filed, a genuine
issue of material fact exists about whether the practice exams were publicly filed with the Copyright Office in 2015 when they
were registered. 131

ii. Terms and Conditions

Defendant next argues that even if the practice exams were filed under the secure test rule, they do not qualify as trade
secrets because Plaintiff otherwise did not take reasonable measures to keep them secret. It is uncontroverted that Plaintiff
used a substantially similar process for creating, developing, reviewing, editing, and finalizing items for its practice exams as
for the proctored exams. But certain important measures are not taken with the administration of practice exams that are
taken with the proctored exams; namely, the practice exams are not administered in a controlled environment with a proctor.
And unlike proctored exams, it appears that users can take practice tests an unlimited number times—Defendant took 240
tests as a student and 43 tests after graduation.

[588 F.Supp.3d 1215]

Plaintiff maintains that it took reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of its practice exams by limiting access to
account holders who must log in to a secure online portal and agree to Plaintiff's Terms and Conditions, which include
confidentiality and nondisclosure requirements. Defendant responds that a confidentiality agreement, standing alone, is
insufficient proof of taking reasonable means to protect the practice exam's confidentiality. Defendant argues further that
Plaintiff has hundreds of thousands of customers with online accounts, so asking them to click a checkbox online to agree to
its terms and conditions is not enough to prove that it took measures to protect the practice exams’ confidentiality absent a
showing that Plaintiff enforced those terms and conditions.

In considering this element of Plaintiff's trade secret claim, the Court is mindful that ""Kansas law does not require the holder
of a trade secret to maintain its complete secrecy; rather Kansas law requires merely that the holder of a trade secret
exercise reasonable efforts under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy."" 132 The Court finds a genuine issue of material
fact remains about whether Plaintiff took reasonable measures to maintain the practice exams’ confidentiality. As already
discussed, Plaintiff is correct that there is no evidence that it made the practice exams available to the public by publishing
them. 123 Rather, it is uncontroverted that the practice exams can only be accessed by account holders who first agree to
ATI's Terms and Conditions, which include nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.

The parties cite to competing caselaw from outside of this district about whether nondisclosure and confidentiality
agreements, standing alone, confer trade secret protection. 124 However, several cases within this district have found that
confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions support a party's claim that it took reasonable measures to protect the
confidentiality of its alleged trade secrets, albeit in the employment context. 185The

[588 F.Supp.3d 1216]

Court follows this case law in concluding that confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, like those in Plaintiffs Terms
and Conditions, constitute evidence that Plaintiff took reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of its products that
could only be accessed through its online portal by account holders, including the practice exams. Although Plaintiff has met
its summary judgment burden of submitting evidence that its practice exams meet the definition of trade secret, the Court
cannot find on this record that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for Plaintiff on this issue. A reasonable jury
could determine that the sheer number of times account holders have accessed the practice exams outside of a controlled,
proctored environment demonstrates that it did not take reasonable efforts under these circumstances to maintain their
confidentiality, despite the requirement that account holders agree to its terms and conditions online. 136

2. Acquisition, Use, or Disclosure Without Consent

Plaintiff asserts that Defendant misappropriated ATI's proctored exams and twelve practice exams by disclosing them in her
videos. Defendant disputes disclosing the questions and answers from either the proctored exams or the practice exams.

a. Proctored Exams

Plaintiff first argues that Defendant ""acquired"" the proctored exams ""repeatedly"" when she took three proctored exams in
2015 as a nursing student. It is uncontroverted that Defendant took the proctored exams three times in 2015, that each
administration of the ATI proctored exams followed the standard secure procedure that applies to all of ATI's proctored
exams, and that a CSUSM faculty member proctored all of the ATI proctored exams Defendant took in 2015 under strict
protocols to make sure students did not take notes or take anything out of the exam room.

Defendant states in her declaration that she was not allowed to and did not take any notes or attempt to copy exam
questions during those proctored exams. She also states that she did not recall the questions and answers from proctored
exams she took in 2015 when she created her videos. Plaintiff responds that Defendant's declaration is self-serving and


--- Page 16 ---
constitutes hearsay. As already explained, these objections are overruled and denied. Defendant has firsthand knowledge
about whether she copied exam questions and a finder of fact is entitled to find her credible. The fact that the statements are
self-serving does not render them inadmissible. Nor are these statements made by third-party declarants, so there is no
basis for a hearsay objection. Plaintiff offers no evidence that controverts Defendant's testimony that she did not take notes
or otherwise remember the exam questions and answers from the proctored exams she took in 2015 when she created her
videos in 2017-2019.

Next, Plaintiff argues that Defendant accessed the exam questions by soliciting proctored exam questions and answers from
customers on her YouTube channel and incorporating that information into the revised videos. Plaintiff argues that
Defendant ""continued to receive ATI Proctored Exam and/or ATI Practice Exam questions and answers from nursing
students."" 182 To support this contention,

[588 F.Supp.3d 1217]

Plaintiff cites Defendant's deposition testimony and Exhibit 2 to the Schuman Declaration, submitted with its response to
Defendant's motion for summary judgment. 138 Defendant identified the exhibit as a summary she created of comments on
her YouTube channel with suggestions for topics to cover or ""[the commenters’] ways of remembering information that they
were sharing with the community and with me."" 182 She selected the comments that were included in the document; she
""didn't add all the ‘love your videos’ or ‘thank you so much’ or anything of that stuff; right? If there were suggestions on
‘opics, then—or, like, tricks or mnemonics for remembering stuff, then that's really what | was gleaning from the YouTube
channel."" 14° Defendant prepared Exhibit 2 before making the revised videos in order to incorporate topics that her viewers
suggested she cover.

A reasonable jury could find that Exhibit 2 does not show that Defendant disclosed test items—questions and answers—
rom the proctored exams in her revised videos. First, the comments do not include specific questions and answer sets from
proctored exams. Second, while the document includes topics that the commenters noticed on an ""exam"" or ""test,"" none of
he comments specify whether they came from ATI proctored or practice exams. 14! For example, several comments stated
hat there were questions about certain topics, or identified general nursing facts that they remembered from a test. 142
Comments that seemingly include part of a question or answer do not make clear what type of test the commenter took, nor
does Plaintiff offer evidence that they were made part of Defendant's alleged video disclosures. 143 There is no evidence in
he record about the identities of the commenters, or whether they in fact took ATI's proctored exams.

Plaintiff's misappropriation of trade secret theory relating to its proctored exams

588 F.Supp.3d 1218]

is internally inconsistent. On the one hand, Plaintiff argues that the specific question and answer test items from the
proctored exams constitute its trade secret. Plaintiff invokes trade secret protection for the specific combinations of
questions and answers (including the ""distractor"" answers), and the presentation of those question/answer sets, in its
proctored exams. And it disclaims that the specific proctored exam questions and answers are replicated in the practice
exams, taking pains to distinguish questions that appear similar, on the basis that substantially-similar questions have
different distractor answers. Indeed, Dr. Gorham testified that the purpose of the practice exams ""is to give the student a
flavor for the kind of content they're going to see on a proctored exam, give them a sense for the kind—the topic areas
they're going to encounter, have them become comfortable with formats."" 144

On the other hand, Plaintiff contends that Defendant misappropriated not the specific questions and answers on the
proctored exams, but the topics and concepts tested on either the proctored exams or the practice exams. In other words,
Plaintiff claims that its specific questions and answers are trade secrets, yet Defendant misappropriated those trade secrets
not by revealing specific questions and answers from the proctored exams, but by disclosing concepts regularly tested on
the proctored exams—concepts that it explicitly disclaims constitute its trade secrets. Given Plaintiff's specific position that it
is the question and answer sets from the proctored exams that constitute trade secrets, Plaintiff's more generic evidence of
misappropriation is insufficient to show that the trade secrets themselves were disclosed by Defendant. 145

Plaintiff argues that Defendant cannot avoid liability by arguing that she disclosed only part of Plaintiff's trade secrets, relying
in part on the fact that Defendant's terms and conditions included a provision that: ""You agree that ... you will not disclose
any portion of ATI Products to any other person or entity."" 146 But Plaintiff fails to submit evidence that Defendant disclosed
even a portion of the alleged trade secret—the specific test questions or answers—in her videos. Merely identifying

[588 F.Supp.3d 1219]

topic areas and nursing facts about which Plaintiff tends to test does not amount to disclosure of a portion of the trade secret
as defined by Plaintiff.

In an apparent attempt to resolve this inconsistency, Plaintiff argues that Defendant disclosed test items on the proctored
exams by ""tipping off"" her viewers to questions and answers. To support this claim, Plaintiff relies on Dr. Gorham's lay
opinion testimony, and on an exhibit documenting incidents where it claims Defendant emphasized in her videos question
and answer test items from its proctored exams. 142 This exhibit presents quoted excerpts from Defendant's videos next to
proctored exam question and answer items. These are the same instances presented to the Court at the preliminary
injunction hearing. The exhibit includes Defendant's statements in certain videos about information being ""important,"" ""super
important,"" a ""key one,"" or ""a big one"" to know, or that her viewers should ""be familiar with"" or ""definitely remember"" certain


--- Page 17 ---
nursing facts ""for your exam."" 148 Dr. Gorham testified in his deposition that Defendant's language in these instances
signaled to the viewer that she was flagging a test item, which he called ""teaching to the test."" 149

None of statements identified by Plaintiff in the comparison chart include test items from the proctored exams. Defendant
does not present questions and answers at all. The closest Defendant comes to referencing specific exam questions in the
comparison chart are six instances where she references a ""test."" For example, on the Medical Surgical Nursing Video
(Video 22), at 5:07-5:14, Defendant discusses ""some important points in terms of nursing care of patients who have
pacemakers.... You should always assess for hiccups, and this is super important for the test."" 459 The corresponding
proctored exam question asks [Redacted] While Defendant's tip indicated [Redacted] her video did not reveal the question,
nor the distractor answers.

As another example, on the Medical Surgical Nursing Video (Video 14) at 1:17-1:32, when discussing chest tubes,
Defendant states that ""if you see a test question with these different findings for a patient and you see a drainage level of like
120 mL over the last hour, that is not expected—that's really high."" 15"" The actual proctored exam question asks about
[Redacted] 152 While Defendant certainly predicted a test question dealing with [Redacted] the number was not identical, nor
did she disclose the actual question or distractor answers.

As another example, on the Maternal Newborn Nursing Video (Video 12) at 3:03-3:25, Defendant discusses magnesium in
the context of gestational hypertension. She states that watching for several specific signs of magnesium toxicity is ""a key
one that you need to be familiar with,"" and that ""whenever you see that on a test, that is usually—you know, your priority
patient."" 453 The corresponding proctored exam question identified by Plaintiff asks [Redacted]

Plaintiff's comparison chart does not demonstrate that Defendant misappropriated Plaintiff's proctored test items from
Plaintiff's proctored exam in her videos. Neither Exhibit 2 nor the comparison

[588 F.Supp.3d 1220]
chart include disclosures of specific proctored exam questions and answers. 154

Defendant also submits evidence that she used the ""tipping"" terminology identified by Plaintiff throughout her videos, well
beyond the incidents documented in Plaintiff's comparison chart. She provides an explanation in her declaration for each
incident of misappropriation identified in Plaintiffs comparison chart, and attests that she did not know that they were in fact
tested on the proctored exam. Finally, the evidence demonstrates that Marsh performed a statistical analysis on at least one
school's proctored exams to determine if Defendant was teaching to the test and found no evidence of impropriety.
Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is denied on its proctored exam trade secret claim. Defendant's motion
for summary judgment is granted because Plaintiff has failed to submit evidence from which a reasonable jury could
conclude that Defendant misappropriated its proctored exam test items.

b. Practice Exams

Defendant does not move for summary judgment on the misappropriation element of Plaintiff's practice exam claim, which is
largely based on certain admissions by Defendant that any similarities between her videos and ATI's products are to the
practice exams and not the proctored exams.

It is uncontroverted that Defendant disclosed in the initial videos information she learned from taking ATI's practice exams.
155 And Defendant admits that she included information in her initial videos based on the questions she saw on ATI's practice
exams. 1581n response to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, Defendant argued that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that
she disclosed information from the twelve practice exams it claims are trade secrets. This argument was based on the fact
that Plaintiff failed to submit the twelve practice exams with its summary judgment motion, or otherwise show particular
disclosures from those twelve exams. In reply, citing this as a ""circular attorney argument,"" Plaintiff again pointed to
Defendant's admissions from her deposition.

As part of Defendant's surreply, which this Court allows to address the new Robins’ declaration and attached practice
exams disclosed and attached for the first time to Plaintiffs reply, she argues that Plaintiff still fails to identify the questions,
answers, or other specific information in the practice exams that it claims Defendant disclosed. She addresses in the
surreply the specific deposition citations in Plaintiff's reply brief that it maintains evidence disclosure. The Court has
reviewed that deposition testimony and agrees that none of Defendant's admissions reference specific exam questions and
answers, nor do they reference the twelve specific practice tests that Plaintiff alleges are trade secrets. It is uncontroverted
that Defendant took over 200 practice exams. Her statements in the videos and deposition testimony explaining those
statements make clear that she was referencing the types of questions or trends she has noticed from taking so many
exams, not specific test items or even specific tests.

For example, Plaintiff's first citation discusses the following ""disclosure"" Defendant

[588 F.Supp.3d 1221]

made in her video about the Community Health practice exam: ""So one is that when you take your Community Health
Nursing exam, you'll find that ATI will be asking you questions that aren't necessarily specific to the community."" 52 When
asked about this statement and whether she was referring to proctored or practice exams, Defendant testified:


--- Page 18 ---
| took a lot of practice exams including multiple ATl Community Health practice exam[s]. And if you take those
practice exams, it's very clear that the type of questions they ask you actually aren't all focused on Community
Health Nursing. They're kind of like questions on medications or pediatrics or other things kind of disguised as
community health questions. 158

Defendant similarly testified elsewhere that her statements about students being ""likely to see"" certain concepts on the tests
were based on her experience taking many practice exams where ""certain facts or concepts, like, constantly reinforced
through those practice exams and through my reading, and so | would definitely tell my viewers some of the key facts |
would definitely know because | had seen them so many times on practice exams."" 152

Another specific disclosure cited by Plaintiff is from the Medical Surgical Nursing video, where Defendant stated that ""[a]n
example of a black tag situation would be a penetrating head wound .... A patient is not really going to come back from that.
And so if they're not dead, they will likely die soon. So there's an example there. So just know those classifications because |
have seen questions on ATI about those."" 182 When asked where the statement came from, Defendant testified that she was
""referring to the ATI practice exams that [she] took"" before graduation. 161 Again, there is no disclosure identified that
involves test questions or answers, and Defendant does not refer to any specific practice exam in the admissions cited by
Plaintiff.

Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on this element of Plaintiff's practice exam claim.
Defendant does not separately move on this element of the practice exam trade secrets claim; she only moves for summary
judgment on whether the practice exams constitute trade secrets. Because the Court finds that a genuine issue of material
fact exists on the first element of that claim, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.

C. Unfair Competition

Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on its unfair competition claim that arises under Kansas law. Defendant moves for
summary judgment on the basis that this claim is preempted by both the Copyright Act and the KUTSA.

Plaintiff's unfair competition claim in the Pretrial Order is alleged as follows:
[588 F.Supp.3d 1222]

Parkes wrongfully accessed ATI's proprietary content; reproduced, displayed, and distributed that content; and
created derivative works from that content, in violation of her contractual obligations under ATI's Terms and
Conditions. Parkes further wrongfully created and promoted content using ATI's goodwill without ATI's consent,
and unjustly profited therefrom. Parkes’ wrongful actions are likely to cause mistake, confusion, or deception as
to Parkes’ affiliation, connection, or association with ATI, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval by ATI of
Parkes’ infringing works. Parkes’ wrongful actions constitute unfair competition. 182

Kansas law recognizes a claim for unfair competition. 18 Courts in this district have predicted that Kansas would adopt the
Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition for this tort, 484 which provides the following guidance:

One who causes harm to the commercial relations of another by engaging in a business or trade is not subject to
liability to the other for such harm unless:

(a) the harm results from acts or practices of the actor actionable by the other under the rules of this
Restatement relating to

(1) deceptive marketing, as specified in Chapter Two
(2) infringement of trademarks and other indicia of identification, as specified in Chapter Three;

(3) appropriation of intangible trade values including trade secrets and the right of publicity, as specified in
Chapter Four;

or from other acts or practices of the actor determined to be actionable as an unfair method of competition, taking
into account the nature of the conduct and its likely effect on both the person seeking relief and the public .... 185

Comment g to the Restatement discusses the residual clause of liability in subsection (a), and advises: ""A competitor who
diverts business from another ... through the wrongful use of confidential information, for example, may in some
circumstances be subject to liability for unfair competition even if the conduct is not specifically actionable under the rules
relating to deceptive marketing or the appropriation of trade secrets."" 186

As Judges Vratil and Crabtree have explained, Kansas views this common law claim broadly:

Unfair competition ... does not describe a single course of conduct or a tort with a specific number of elements; it
instead describes a general category into which a number of new torts may be placed when recognized by the
courts. The category is open-ended, and nameless forms of unfair competition may be recognized at any time for
the protection of commercial values. 182


--- Page 19 ---
Having explained the scope of an unfair competition claim under Kansas law, the Court turns to Defendant's preemption
arguments.

[588 F.Supp.3d 1223]
1. Copyright Act Preemption

First, Defendant argues that the Copyright Act preempts enforcement of state common law or statutory claims within the
scope of the Act. 188 To determine whether the Copyright Act preempts Plaintiff's state-law unfair competition claim, the
Court must determine whether the rights asserted by Plaintiff in that claim ""are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights
within the general scope of the copyright, as specified in 17 U.S.C. § 106."" 182Section 106 ""grants to the copyright owner the
exclusive rights to (1) reproduce the copyrighted work; (2) prepare derivative works; (3) distribute copies of the work; (4)
perform the work publicly; and (5) display the work publicly."" 122 However, ""when a state law violation is predicated upon an
act incorporating elements beyond mere reproduction or the like, the rights involved are not equivalent and preemption will
not occur."" 421

Plaintiff argues that its unfair competition claim is predicated upon an additional element beyond a copyright violation—
violation of a confidential relationship—because the claim is premised on Defendant's violation of ATI's Terms and
Conditions. Because confidentiality is not an element of a copyright claim, Plaintiff argues that preemption should not apply.
The Court agrees. The Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition contains a residual clause that permits unfair competition
claims premised on a breach of confidential information. Plaintiff's claim as alleged in the Pretrial Order is so premised—
Plaintiff claims that Defendant violated her contractual obligations under ATI's Terms and Conditions by accessing, using,
and reproducing Plaintiff's proprietary content. Breach of a confidential relationship is an extra element that keeps Plaintiff's
claim from being preempted by the Copyright Act. 122

2. KUTSA Preemption

Next, Defendant argues that the unfair competition claim is preempted by the KUTSA. Plaintiff again responds that because
it asserts an extra element that a confidential relationship was breached, its unfair competition claim is not preempted. The
KUTSA contains a preemption provision that is identical to Section 7 of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act : ""Except as provided
in subsection (b), this act displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary and other law of this state providing civil remedies for
misappropriation of a trade secret."" 123 This provision explicitly ""does not affect ‘other civil remedies that are not based on
misappropriation of a trade secret.’ ""124

In 2011, the Kansas Supreme Court made clear in Wolfe Electric, Inc. v. Duckworth that the KUTSA does not prohibit
misappropriation of ""confidential information"" that does not meet the statutory definition of a trade secret. 125""[O]nly

[588 F.Supp.3d 1224]

such defined ‘misappropriation,’ i.e. , limited to trade secrets, can serve as the basis for recovery under KUTSA for
compensatory and exemplary damages, injunctive relief, and attorney fees."" 178 The Kansas Supreme Court found errors
with jury instructions that were overly inclusive on the KUTSA claims; they erroneously instructed the jury that the plaintiff
could recover under the KUTSA for misappropriated trade secrets and ""mere confidential information."" 1“ The court also
found instructional error with business tort instructions that allowed the plaintiff to recover for misuse of trade secrets,
despite the fact that the KUTSA is the exclusive remedy for such recovery. 178 However, the court explicitly refrained from
ruling on the issue of whether the KUTSA ""displace[s] other tort causes of action for recovery of damages for nontrade
secrets,"" because the defendants had not previously raised the issue. 172

In attempting to resolve this state law issue, the Court ""must look to the rulings of the state's highest court and, where no
controlling state decision exists, the Court must endeavor to predict how the state's highest court would rule."" 182 In making
hat determination, the Court may consider ""analogous decisions by the state Supreme Court, the decisions of the lower
courts in the state, the decisions of the federal courts and of other state courts, and the general weight and trend of
authority."" 181 Here, the state's highest court has not decided the operative question: whether the KUTSA preempts an unfair
competition claim seeking recovery for misappropriation of confidential information that does not meet the definition of a
rade secret.

There is a split of authority regarding the scope of the UTSA's preemption provision. The first line of cases ""holds that the
UTSA preempts only those civil claims based upon trade secrets as defined in the statute, but does not preempt civil claims
based on information that fails to meet that statutory definition."" 182 Under this approach, the plaintiff may present alternative
heories of relief, in the event that certain information does not qualify as a trade secret under the Act. 183 The second line of
cases holds that ""determining whether the allegedly misappropriated information constitutes a trade secret is irrelevant for
preemption purposes because the UTSA preempts all claims based upon the unauthorized use of information, even if the
information does not meet the statutory definition of a trade secret."" 184 Another line of cases applies a ""same facts"" standard
hat asks whether the Plaintiff's claim is ""merely a restatement of the same operative facts"" of the UTSA claim. 185

588 F.Supp.3d 1225]

Although the Kansas Supreme Court withheld ruling on the preemption issue in Wolfe Electric , it repeatedly cited with
approval First Advantage Background Services Corp. v. Private Eyes, Inc. , where the Northern District of California


--- Page 20 ---
considered whether the California Uniform Trade Secret Act (""CUTSA"") preempts a state law claim based on disclosure of
confidential information. 18° That case held that because the CUTSA only provides a remedy for misappropriation of trade
secrets, the plaintiff's fraud claim premised on disclosure of confidential information was preempted ""[i]f the confidential
information [the defendant] allegedly disclosed was in fact a protectible trade secret."" 182 However, the court concluded that:

[The defendant] may continue to pursue the claim for false promise, so long as the confidential information at the
foundation of the claim is not a trade secret, as that term is defined in CUTSA. If, in subsequent pleadings or
briefs, or at trial, it is established that the disclosures on which [the plaintiff] bases this claim were trade secrets,
the claim will be dismissed with prejudice. 188

The First Advantage decision is in accord with the Kansas Court of Appeals’ unpublished decision in LendingTools.com, Inc.
v. Bankers’ Bank, N.A. 182 There, the court considered whether the KUTSA displaces other tort claims as an alternative
theory of recovery for misappropriation of nontrade secrets. 12° After considering the plain language of the statute, the court
held that the KUTSA ""does not preempt tort claims based on the misappropriation of information that falls outside of the
statutory definition of a trade secret."" 191

This Court predicts that the Kansas Supreme Court would follow First Advantage and LendingTools.com and find that the
KUTSA does not displace common law torts based on the misappropriation of confidential information that falls short of
meeting the definition of trade secret. This Court has already granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant on Plaintiff's
misappropriation of trade secrets claim based on the proctored exams because Plaintiff has not submitted evidence that
Defendant misappropriated those trade secrets as Plaintiff defined them. The Court denied summary judgment on the
practice exams claim because a genuine issue of material fact exists about whether the practice exams are trade secrets
under the DTSA and KUTSA; Defendant did not move for summary judgment on the misappropriation element of that claim.
To the extent Plaintiffs unfair competition claim is premised on use or disclosure of information that is ultimately found to
constitute trade secrets, it is preempted by the KUTSA, and the claim must be dismissed. However, to the extent Plaintiff's
claim seeks to recover for disclosure of confidential information that is ultimately found to fall short of constituting trade
secrets, Plaintiff may continue to pursue the claim. Therefore, Defendant's summary judgment motion is denied on its
preemption defense; Plaintiff may continue to pursue its unfair competition claim based on the misappropriation of

[588 F.Supp.3d 1226]
confidential information that does not meet the definition of trade secret.
3. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment

Plaintiff argues that the Court should grant summary judgment in its favor on the liability component of its unfair competition
claim, incorporating by reference its arguments on the copyright and misappropriation of trade secrets claims. For
substantially the same reasons explained in the Court's analysis of the copyright and misappropriation of trade secrets
claims, summary judgment is not warranted in Plaintiffs favor. Genuine issues of material fact exist on issues of substantial
similarity between the products, whether the practice exams constitute trade secrets, and whether Defendant disclosed
confidential information from the proctored exams that falls short of trade secrets—an argument not formally addressed by
either party. As such, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on its unfair competition claim is denied.

D. Breach of Contract

Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on the liability component of its breach of contract claim. Defendant moves for
summary judgment solely on the basis that because Plaintiff does not seek monetary damages, it cannot maintain a breach
of contract claim under Kansas law.

Under Kansas law, a party establishes breach of contract by proving five elements: ""(1) the existence of a contract between
the parties; (2) sufficient consideration to support the contract; (3) the plaintiff's performance or willingness to perform in
compliance with the contract; (4) the defendant's breach of the contract; and (5) damages to the plaintiff caused by the
breach."" 192

It is uncontroverted that the first three elements of Plaintiff's claim are met. Plaintiff submitted evidence that a contract exists
between the parties. Defendant agreed to ATI's Terms and Conditions three different times when she was an ATI-account
holder. The Court has overruled Defendant's authentication objections to those exhibits, which is the only argument
Defendant offers to controvert the existence of a contract. Defendant received consideration because she accessed and
used Plaintiff's products between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for her agreement to abide by Plaintiff's Terms and
Conditions. Plaintiff performed under the contract by giving Defendant access to its products.

There is a genuine issue of material fact however about whether Defendant breached the agreement by ""copying and
distributing ATI's copyrighted works,"" or ""by accessing ATI's online content for purposes not authorized by ATI."" 198 As
discussed earlier in this Order, the Court finds a genuine issue of material fact exists about whether Defendant copied
Plaintiff's materials and about whether she created derivative works. According to Defendant, she taught nursing facts that
are not proprietary to Plaintiff. A genuine issue of material fact exists about the extent to which the parties’ products are
similar beyond publicly-available nursing facts.

Plaintiff argues that Defendant breached the agreement by admitting to using the practice exams to create her videos. As
the Court discussed on the misappropriation of trade secrets claims, Plaintiff oversells these admissions. Plaintiff admitted


--- Page 21 ---
[588 F.Supp.3d 1227]

taking many practice exams and using her overall knowledge of the nursing concepts and question topics, as well as other
sources, to create her videos. But a reasonable jury could conclude that these admission do not show that she ""used"" the
practice exams in violation of the Terms and Conditions. Thus, summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff is not appropriate.

Defendant moves for summary judgment on the fifth element of this claim because Plaintiff did not suffer actual damages; it
only seeks injunctive relief. According to Defendant, Plaintiff must seek monetary damages to prevail on its breach of
contract claim. The Court agrees with Plaintiff that it is not required to prove monetary damages in order to recover. Instead,
""if damages at law cannot adequately compensate the injury sustained from the breach or cannot be reasonably measured,
then the remedy at law is inadequate and injunctive relief ... may be appropriate because of irreparable injury."" 1%

Defendant replies that if Plaintiff's claim involves loss of goodwill, customers, and competitive advantage, it has failed to
submit evidence to support these components of its claim. The Court disagrees. The same evidence Defendant relies on
in support of its affirmative defenses—the many emails sent to Plaintiff by customers and sales representatives asking
whether Defendant was affiliated with ATI—demonstrates loss of goodwill and competitive advantage. Defendant's motion
for summary judgment on this claim is therefore denied.

E. Affirmative Defenses

In response to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, Defendant asserts several affirmative defenses. Plaintiff contends
Defendant's affirmative defenses fail because she did not raise them in her own motion for summary judgment. As
discussed under the summary judgment standard, the Court disagrees. While the Court cannot grant summary judgment in
favor of Defendant on these affirmative defenses since they were not raised as part of Defendant's motion, the Court must
deny Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment if it finds genuine issues of material fact on these affirmative defenses. The
Court has already denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the elements of its claims; thus, the Court provides the
following brief analysis of Defendant's affirmative defenses as additional support for denying Plaintiffs motion for summary
judgment.

1. Equitable Estoppel

First, Defendant raises equitable estoppel as a defense to all claims raised by Plaintiff. As a defense to a copyright claim,
courts typically require the following showing:

(1) the plaintiff must know the facts of the defendant's infringing conduct; (2) the plaintiff must intend that its
conduct shall be acted on or must so act that the defendant has a right to believe that it is so intended; (3) the
defendant must be ignorant of the true facts; and (4) the defendant must rely on the plaintiff's conduct to its
injury. 198

[588 F.Supp.3d 1228]

Defendant has submitted evidence in support of each element. Defendant's evidence demonstrates that both ATI's Test
Security Department and Legal Department were aware of Defendant's products. Defendant points to a series of emails
beginning in April 2018 from customers and sales representatives to ATI's Test Security Department about Defendant's
videos. The oft-repeated responses from ATI's Test Security Department indicated that Plaintiff had reviewed the videos,
that Defendant was not doing anything ""illegal,"" that her products were ""like Cliffts Notes,"" and that she was doing Plaintiff's
clients a service. Many of these emails indicate that the legal department had reviewed the emails. By September 6, 2018,
ATI employee Kendra Darigan was instructed to purchase Defendant's study cards to review. Although ATI's legal team sent
Defendant a letter demanding that she remove its trademarks from her products, the letter conveys that Plaintiff was aware
of Defendant's products and does not raise concerns about copyright infringement.

Bill Parkes took contemporaneous notes during an October 18, 2018 phone call with Pontes, indicating that Pontes told him:
(1) ATI believed that Defendant was helping students greatly; (2) ATI knew that Defendant was not using ATI's content; (3)
ATI thought what Defendant was doing was ""awesome""; (4) Defendant taught to the curriculum and not the tests; (5) ATI
had reviewed the study cards and had no copyright concerns; (6) Pontes had listened to a dozen of Defendant's videos and
thought Defendant was ""great"" and ATI would love to have her as an instructor; (7) after ATI started looking at Defendant's
work product, it concluded that Defendant was helping people and it was ""wonderful""; (8) Pontes loved the new name, Level
Up RN; (9) ATI did not see any copyright issues; and (10) he should tell his wife that she is doing a ""fantastic job."" 12% These
comments are consistent with Plaintiff's emails to customers and employees asking about Defendant's products.

After this call, Bill Parkes copied his notes into a text message and sent them to Defendant. Defendant responded that she
was relieved to hear that ATI did not have any concerns with the content she had created. Defendant had no prior
experience with copyright issues, nor contrary advice from a lawyer or anyone else that they were violating any of ATI's
copyrights or improperly disclosing test information. Defendant felt ""exceedingly confident,"" based on the positive feedback
Bill Parkes had communicated to her from Pontes, ""that we were doing the right thing and doing so with the full support of,
and validation from, ATI."" 128 After receiving this feedback, and removing trademark concerns identified by ATI, Defendant
did not receive any further communication from Pontes. Defendant proceeded to spend hundreds of hours and
approximately $900,000 creating new study cards and video content.

Plaintiff responds to this evidence by arguing that Wood only reviewed five or six videos when she wrote her emails


--- Page 22 ---
disclaiming illegal conduct by Defendant, and that Pontes only reviewed two or three snippets from the videos before she
spoke to Parkes. It argues further that Pontes’ discussion with Parkes only addressed trademark infringement. A reasonable
jury could conclude that regardless of how many videos Wood and Pontes claim to have watched, their outward statements
convey that Plaintiff had reviewed all of Plaintiff's products and was aware of Defendant's allegedly infringing conduct in

[588 F.Supp.3d 1229]

2018. Moreover, a reasonable jury could rely on Bill Parkes’ call notes with Pontes and credit his recollection that the call
also addressed copyright issues. Because there are genuine issues of material fact on this affirmative defense, it is an
additional reason to deny Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the copyright claim.

Plaintiff's state law claims may also be subject to an equitable estoppel affirmative defense. ""Equitable estoppel is the effect
of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby it is precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting rights against another
person relying on such conduct."" 122 To demonstrate equitable estoppel under Kansas law, Defendant must demonstrate

that another party, by acts, representations, admissions, or silence when that other party had a duty to speak,
induced the party asserting estoppel to believe certain facts existed. The party asserting estoppel must also
show that the party reasonably relied and acted upon such belief and would now be prejudiced if the other party
were permitted to deny the existence of such facts. 222

The same facts outlined above are sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact on this affirmative defense under
Kansas law.

2. Implied Consent by Waiver and Acquiescence

Defendant next asserts an affirmative defense to Plaintiff's copyright claim on the basis that she was granted an implied
license by waiver or acquiescence to use Plaintiff's products. There is no Tenth Circuit authority for determining when a
copyright owner conveys an implied license, but other jurisdictions have construed the defense narrowly: ""implied non-
exclusive licenses should be found only in narrow circumstances where one party created a work at the other's request and
handed it over, intending that the other copy and distribute it."" 2°! The defense applies ""[w]hen an owner's conduct ‘clearly’
manifests ‘a consent to ... use’ of copyrighted material."" 222 Some courts have held that an implied license can arise ""where
the totality of the parties’ conduct supported such an outcome,"" in the absence of a work-for-hire agreement. 2° Similarly, ""
[u]nder Kansas law, ‘[w]aiver is ordinarily the intentional relinquishment of a known right and is a voluntary act.’ Although
waiver must be knowing and intentional, intent may be inferred from conduct, and the knowledge may be actual or
constructive, but ‘both knowledge and intent are essential elements.’ ""2°

For the reasons stated above on the estoppel defense, Defendant offers evidence that raises a genuine issue of material
[588 F.Supp.3d 1230]

fact about whether Plaintiff's conduct manifested an intent for Defendant to use Plaintiff's materials. There is a genuine issue
of material fact about whether Plaintiff's statements to Bill Parkes on October 18, 2018 were made with knowledge and intent
to waive their claims in this case.

3. Fair Use

Finally, Defendant argues that the fair use defense precludes summary judgment on the copyright claim. Section 107 of the
Copyright Act provides in relevant part:

[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work, ... for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
(including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In
determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall
include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 205

As the Supreme Court recently explained, this list of factors is not exhaustive, and some factors may prove more important
in some contexts than in others. 228 For example, ""copyright's protection may be stronger where the copyrighted material is
fiction, not fact, where it consists of a motion picture rather than a news broadcast, or where it serves an artistic rather than a
utilitarian function."" 227 Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact. 228

Defendant has offered sufficient evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact about whether the fair use defense
bars Plaintiffs copyright claim. Plaintiff argues that the uncontroverted evidence shows that Defendant copied the review


--- Page 23 ---
modules for her own for-profit business. But as already discussed, there is a genuine issue of material fact about whether
Defendant copied the protectable elements of Plaintiff's copyright. In fact, the central issue on the copyright claim is whether
she copied protectable rather than the nonprotectable elements of the compilation copyrights. And while it is true that
Defendant's sale of study cards is commercial in nature, the videos are available to the public free of charge. And this is but
one factor relevant to the fair use inquiry. The nature of the copyrighted work, which is purely informational, and the fact that
Defendant did not reproduce the review modules in their entirety weigh in favor of Defendant. Some of the emails Plaintiff
sent to customers and employees indicate that Plaintiff considered Defendant's videos fair use. The Court will not conduct
an extensive analysis of the fair use factors for purposes of summary judgment given that Plaintiff barely addresses it in the
reply. However, the Court concludes that Defendant has come forward with evidence that raises a genuine issue of material
fact on this affirmative defense and provides additional support for denying Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the
copyright claim.

22 The parties ""stipulated"" to the authenticity of the documents they produced during discovery. Doc. 293 at 5 § 2.c.1-2. Plaintiff ""stipulates"" that its
documents are what they say they are and Defendant does the same for her own documents. It is unclear why these statements are included in the
stipulation section of the Amended Pretrial Order given that neither party agrees that their opponent's documents are authentic. Tellingly, Defendant picks
and chooses when to rely on Plaintiff's stipulation—relying on it at least once in its own statements of fact when it cites to Plaintiff's Bates-numbered
documents. See Doc. 335 at 10 n.1.

23 See Doc. 346-1 at 33:16-20 (""I don't recall seeing this document. I'm assuming this was probably the document, but | didn't read when | hit ‘agree,’ but

objections. These facts cite to paragraphs in Defendant's declaration that do not reference statements made by a third-party declarant and thus, do not
appear to fall within the rule against hearsay. For example, there is no basis for a hearsay objection to Defendant's statement that she did not take notes
during the proctored exams she took in nursing school, her statement that she did not have access to the proctored exams after graduation, or her
statement that she does not remember the proctored exam questions. See Doc. 300 4 6, 13.

are medically defined and standard. See, e.g. , id. and Doc. 337-22. While this may demonstrate that certain nursing facts are medically defined, it does
not demonstrate that ATI's decision to organize and select nursing facts in the review module as it did is medically dictated or unoriginal. Moreover, the
Court considered evidence at the preliminary injunction stage about how other nursing texts organized the same nursing facts covered in the review
modules and found that the review modules’ overall organization is unique among nursing-education resources. Doc. 59 at 12-13.

121 Id,

122 Defendant cites to William-Abrams’ deposition, but he testified that while he believed there were certain materials sold by ATI that are available for
purchase by the public, he was not sure which products, and that the head of marketing would know the answer to that question. Doc. 298-2 at 50:7-25.
Dr. Gorham states in his declaration that users can only access ATI's products by agreeing to the Terms and Conditions. Doc. 14-9 § 13. Defendant does

145 To the extent this finding is inconsistent with the Court's preliminary injunction ruling, the Court reconsiders and clarifies its ruling at this time. The
summary judgment record is far more robust than the record at the preliminary injunction hearing, the parties’ theories on this claim are clearer, and the
Court has had time to conduct further research on this issue. See Been v. O.K. Indus., Inc. , 495 F.3d 1217 , 1224-25 (10th Cir. 2007) (explaining that

injunction order on summary judgment). In its preliminary injunction order, the Court considered and rejected authority cited by Defendant for the
proposition that it must compare the original and misappropriated materials side-by-side. Doc. 59 at 32-34. The Court found that the cases cited by
Defendant were inapposite because they discussed copyright infringement, and not misappropriation of trade secrets. See Am. Registry of Radiologic
Technologists v. Bennett , 939 F. Supp. 2d 695 (W.D. Tex. 2013) ; Educ. Testing Serv. v. Simon , 95 F. Supp. 2d 1081 (C.D. Cal. 1999) ; Nat’ Conf. of
Bar Exam'rs v. Saccuzzo , No. 03CV0737BTM (NLS), 2003 WL 21467772 (S.D. Cal. June 10, 2003). While the Court stands by this discussion of those
particular cases, it has been unable to find authority to support Plaintiff's position that ""disclosure"" of Plaintiff's trade secrets can be accomplished by
disclosing test concepts or question topics rather than specific test items, given Plaintiff's definition of its protected trade secrets in this case as the test
items themselves.

OPINION AND ORDER
GREGORY H. WOODS, United States District Judge
|. INTRODUCTION

In June of 2017, Plaintiff Jonathan Otto attended a friend's wedding at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey. To the
surprise of the celebrants, President Trump, the owner of the venue, crashed the wedding. The guests seem to have been
delighted by the appearance of this unexpected guest, who lingered at the reception to take photographs with the
newlyweds and sign autographs. Otto took the opportunity to capture the moment and snapped a photo on his iPhone, and
later texted it to another guest at the wedding, Sean Burke. The next morning, Otto discovered that the image had gone
viral: it had been published on the social media platform Instagram and in several media outlets, including Esquire.com,
operated by Defendant Hearst Communications. Perhaps recognizing a lucrative business opportunity, Otto retained
counsel the following day and quickly filed a copyright in the image. Otto brought this action, among several others against
various media publishers, alleging that his copyright in the photograph had been infringed.

Before the court are cross motions for partial summary judgment. Otto seeks judgment on Hearst's liability for copyright
infringement and the affirmative defenses asserted by Defendant. Pl.'s Memo iso Mot. for Part. Summ. J. (Dkt. No. 36) (""PI.'s
Memo""). Defendant seeks judgment on its fair use defense and on whether Hearst's alleged infringement was willful. Def.'s
Memo iso Mot. for Part. Summ. J. and Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (Dkt. No. 51) (""Def.'s Memo.""). Stealing a copyrighted
photograph to illustrate a news article, without adding new understanding or meaning to the work, does not transform its
purpose—regardless of whether that photograph was created for commercial or personal use. For this reason, among
others, Plaintiff's motion is granted in whole and Defendant's motion is denied in whole.

[345 F.Supp.3d 420]
Il. BACKGROUND +
A. Facts

1. The Parties

Plaintiff in this matter is Jonathan Otto, a Vice President at Deustche Bank. This suit arose from a photograph Otto took on
his iPhone at a private wedding, which was subsequently published by several media outlets, including Defendant. Otto,
self-described as just a ""guy with an iPhone,"" is not and has never been a professional photographer. Pl.'s Memo. at 1;
Det.'s 56.1 Stmt. 29 7-8.

Defendant Hearst Communications, Inc. is a corporation organized under Delaware law. Compl. (Dkt. No. 1) 46. Hearst is a

magazines, and as relevant here, on the Internet. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. ¢§ 12-13, 25. One of the media outlets owned by Hearst
is the Esquire magazine and website. /d. J 25, 52. As a media conglomerate, Hearst sometimes licenses photographs for
use in its publications. /d. 14-18. To assist with this process, Hearst employs in-house attorneys who are familiar with
copyright law and licensing practices in the publishing industry. /d.

2. The Wedding

On June 10, 2017, Otto attended his friend's wedding at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Def.'s
56.1 Stmt. 94 1, 6, 9. To the guests’ surprise, Donald Trump, President of the United States and owner of the club,
appeared at the wedding. /d. { 3. President Trump stayed to sign autographs and take photographs with the couple. Ex C to
Compl. (Dkt. No. 1-3) (""Esquire Article""). Seizing the opportunity to capture a ""remarkable"" event, Otto took several
photographs of President Trump on his iPhone, including the one at issue in this matter (the ""Photograph""). Def.'s 56.1
Stmt. {4 29-30, 32; see also Compl. § 7; Ex. A to Compl. (the ""Photograph""). The Photograph depicts President Trump with


--- Page 2 ---
the bride, Kristen Piatowski. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. § 28; see the Photograph. Other wedding guests took similar photographs.
Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. ¥ 41.

At the time Otto took the Photograph, his intention was to document an important memory and newsworthy event. Def.'s
56.1 Stmt. 33; Ex. A to Bishop Decl. (Dkt. No. 57-1) (""Otto Tr."") at 15:22-16:3, 19:7-9. He planned to use the Photograph
for personal, rather than commercial, purposes, and did not intend to share the photograph with friends and family or share it
on social media. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. 94 31-32; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. (Dkt. No. 72) 4 123-24. After taking the photo,
Otto used an iPhone editing application to modify the image. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. 34. Otto's name was entered in the
copyright section of the Photograph's data. /d. § 35. One other wedding guest, Sean Burke, asked Otto to share the
Photograph with him, which he did by text message. /d. 38. Otto did not ask how Burke planned to use the Photograph,
and the two did not discuss the Photograph any further that night. Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s 56.1

[345 F.Supp.3d 421]

Stmt. 9§ 125, 127; Otto Tr. at 25:21-23. Otto did not share the Photograph with anyone else and did not post the
photograph on his own social media platforms. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. 7 36, 39.

3. The Publication

On Saturday, June 11, the day after the wedding, Otto discovered that the Photograph he sent to Burke had been published
in several media outlets, including TMZ, CNN, the Washington Post, and the Daily Mail. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. { 42. Otto reached
out to TMZ via Twitter, notifying them that they had used his photograph without permission and that he wanted to be

Instagram account. /d. § 78, 80. Many other photographs depicting President Trump at the wedding were also circulated on
the Internet. /d. 94 79, 81.

That same day, Hearst ran its own article on Esquire's website entitled ""President Trump is the Ultimate Wedding Crasher.""
Compl. q 11; Esquire Article. The article, written by Peter Wade, described President Trump's appearance at the wedding
and was illustrated by three pictures, including the Photograph. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. 4] 54, 67; see Esquire Article. Wade, who
is no longer employed with Esquire, had learned about the event from an article in The Hill. Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s 56.1 Stmt.

to find the original source"" and had come across several photos on Ms. Piatowski's Instagram. Sebastian Decl. iso Def.'s
Mot. for Part. Summ. J. (Dkt. No. 54) (""Sebastian Decl."") { 3-6; Ex. A to Sebastian Decl. (""Wade and Sebastian Slack
Conversation""). Wade used the photographs from Ms. Piatowski's Instagram in the article, crediting her account as the
source of the photos. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. 4 49-50; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. § 138-39.

The Esquire article reads:

The most recognizable guest at Kristen Piatowski and Tucker Gladhill's wedding on Saturday night wasn't even
invited. President Donald Trump crashed the couple's wedding taking place at Trump National Golf Club in
Bedminster, New Jersey.

Photos surfaced on Instagram showing the husband and wife smiling with President Trump, who apparently
stopped by to greet the couple and shake hands with the guests.

Trump has become such a fixture at nuptials at his resorts, the Bedminster club once advertised a Trump
appearance as a potential feature of booking a wedding there, according to a now-discontinued brochure
obtained by the New York Times:

""If [Trump] is on-site for your big day, he will likely stop in & congratulate the happy couple. He may take some
photos with you but we ask you and your guests to be respectful of his time and privacy.""

[345 F.Supp.3d 422]
This was Trump's 24th visit to a golf course since he was elected. In addition to making an appearance, it looks
like Trump also took the time to sign autographs for fans. One photo showed Trump with a Sharpie, waving a
Make America Great Again hat.

4. The Suit

The day after the Photograph was published widely on the Internet, Otto hired counsel and registered the Photograph with
the Copyright Office. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. 4 83-84. The application was approved and Otto currently possesses a registration
certificate, numbered VA 2-055-309 and dated June 12, 2017. /d. 90-92; see also Ex. L to Otto Decl. (Dkt. No. 38-12)

alleged unauthorized distribution of the Photograph. Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. ¥ 133. Otto has filed five copyright
infringement suits in this District against various media companies for the unauthorized use of the Photograph, including this
case. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. 4 102-06. The other four suits have settled, at least one of which resulted into a retroactive
licensing agreement for the Photograph's use. /d. § 107, 110.

Ill. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate when ""the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the
movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) ; see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett 477 U.S. 317,

material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.’ "" (quoting former Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) ) ).
A genuine dispute exists where ""the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,""
while a fact is material if it ""might affect the outcome

former Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) ). ""The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [non-movant's] position will be
insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant]."" Anderson__ 477 U.S. at

examined on its own merits, and in each case all reasonable inferences must be drawn against the party whose motion is
under consideration."" /d. at 121 (citations omitted).

IV. DISCUSSION
In his motion for partial summary judgement, Otto seeks judgment on
[345 F.Supp.3d 424]

Hearst's liability for copyright infringement, on Hearst's assertion of the fair use defense, and on Hearst's remaining
affirmative defenses. In its cross-motion, Hearst also moves for partial summary judgment on its fair use defense, in addition
to whether its alleged infringement was willful—the result of which determines Plaintiff's ability to seek statutory damages
under 17 U.S.C. § 504(c). For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion is granted in whole and Defendant's motion is denied
in whole.

A. Copyright Infringement

Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on the issue of copyright infringement by Hearst, alleging that Hearst has infringed on
its copyright by unlawfully appropriating the Photograph for its use. Pl.'s Memo. at 9. The Court finds that the undisputed
facts demonstrate Hearst's liability for copyright infringement and Plaintiff's motion is granted.

The Copyright Act grants the owner of the copyright the exclusive right to authorize the reproduction, distribution, and
preparation of derivatives of the owner's work. 17 U.S.C. § 106 ; see Harper & Row Publishers. Inc. v. Nation Enterprises
471 U.S. 539 , 546-47, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . To establish liability for an infringement claim, a plaintiff
must prove that (1) she holds a valid ownership interest in the relevant copyrights, and (2) the defendant has ""actually
copied"" her work._Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v. Caro! Pub. Grp.. Inc. , 150 F.3d 132 , 137 (2d Cir. 1998). After establishing
actual copying, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the copying was unlawful by proving a ""substantial similarity"" exists
between the defendant's work and the ""protectable elements"" of her copyrighted work. /d. The Defendant here only argues
that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Otto has a valid ownership interest in the copyright of the
Photograph.

1. Ownership of a Valid Copyright

A certificate of registration from the United States Register of Copyrights constitutes prima facie evidence of the valid
ownership of a copyright. Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony Records, 351 F.3d 46 , 51 (2003) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 410(c) ). Hearst
argues that summary judgment should be denied on this issue because there exists a genuine issue of material fact
regarding whether the copyright certificate proffered by Otto actually protects the photograph at issue. Def.'s Memo. at 37—
38. This position is based on the fact that the copyright certificate that Otto originally submitted with his briefing did not
include a copy of the photograph deposited with the United States Copyright Office. /d. However, the issue was easily
resolved when Otto filed on the docket a certified deposited copy of the copyright registration that included the Photograph,
of which he requests the Court take judicial notice. See Mot. for Judicial Notice (Dkt. No. 76-78). Under Federal Rule of
Evidence 201, the Court can take judicial notice of a fact not subject to reasonable dispute. Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Here,
Hearst has not set forth any evidence that would support a finding that the registration is invalid, and examining the record
before the Court, no reasonable juror could find it so. The certified and deposited copy of the registration clearly shows that
the photograph at issue is the one protected by the certificate. See Ex. B to Freeman Decl. iso PI.'s Mot. for Judicial Notice
(Dkt. No. 78-2) (""Certified Copyright Registration"").

In addition, Otto has submitted three affidavits which support a finding that he owned a valid copyright in the Photograph.
See Otto Decl. { 23-26; Halperin Decl. iso Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (Dkt No. 39)

345 F.Supp.3d 425]

(""Halperin Decl."") 4 6-8; Liebowitz Decl. iso Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (Dkt No. 71) (""Liebowitz Decl."") 44 4-8.
The day after the Photograph appeared in media outlets, Otto retained the services of counsel who registered his copyright
in the Photograph with the United States Copyright Office. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. §§ 83-84, 90-92. The first affidavit is from Otto,
he second is from defense counsel Richard Liebowitz who supervised the application process, and the third is from Donna
Halperin, an employee of the Liebowitz Law Firm who submitted the application. Defendant has moved to strike Ms.
Halperin's affidavit on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to disclose her in his Rule 26 disclosures. Def.'s Mot. to Strike (Dkt.
No. 55) at 3-4. The Court need not address this issue as the certified and deposited copyright registration and remaining
wo affidavits are more than sufficient to determine that Otto owned a valid copyright in the Photograph. Thus, regardless of
he availability of Ms. Halperin's testimony, a reasonable jury could only find that Otto has satisfied the first element of his
infringement claim.

2. Actual Copying and Substantial Similarity


--- Page 5 ---
Once a valid copyright registration is established, ""a plaintiff must [ Jshow that his work was actually copied ... [and] then
must show that the copying amounts to an improper or unlawful appropriation."" Castle Rock._150 F.3d at 137 (2d Cir. 1998)
(citing Laureyssens v. Idea Group. Inc., 964 F.2d 131 , 139-40 (2d Cir. 1992). Actual copying may be shown with direct or
circumstantial evidence that the defendant had access to the copyrighted work and that there are probative similarities
between the works. /d. After actual copying is established, the plaintiff must proceed to demonstrate that the copying was
improper or unlawful by showing that the second work is substantially similar to protected elements of the original work. /d.

Here, the parties do not contest the fact that Hearst actually copied Otto's photograph for its use in the Esquire Article, nor
that the works are substantially similar because they are the same photograph. The parties do not dispute Hearst did not
have Otto's permission to use the Photograph, making the appropriation unlawful. As such, the remaining elements of
Plaintiff's copyright infringement claim have been met.

Accordingly, because Otto has established that he owns a valid copyright in the image, and because the actual copying and
substantial similarity elements have been met, the Court finds that Hearst infringed upon Otto's exclusive right to control the
reproduction and distribution of his photograph. Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on this issue is granted.

B. Affirmative Defenses

Both Otto and Hearst seek summary judgment on Defendant's fair use defense. Otto additionally seeks judgment on
Hearst's remaining defenses: (1) failure to state a claim (first defense); (2) non-infringement (third defense); (3) waiver (sixth
defense); (4) consent (sixth defense); and (5) release (eighth defense). Pl.'s Memo. at 23-24. Where, as here, ""a plaintiff
uses a summary judgment motion ... to challenge the legal sufficiency of an affirmative defense—on which the defendant
bears the burden of proof at trial—a plaintiff may satisfy its rule 56 burden by showing that there is an absence of evidence
to support an essential element of the non-moving party's case.""_F.D./.C. v. Giammettei , 34 F.3d 51 , 54 (2d Cir. 1994)
(citing Celotex.. 477 U.S. at 325 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 ).

[345 F.Supp.3d 426]
1. Fair Use

The purpose of copyright law is ""[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts ...,"" U.S. Const., Art. |, § 8, cl. 8, and
""expand public knowledge and understanding ... by giving potential creators exclusive control over copying of their works,
thus giving them a financial incentive to create informative, intellectually enriching works for public consumption."" Authors
Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 212 (2d Cir. 2015). ""[W]hile authors are undoubtedly important intended beneficiaries
of copyright, the ultimate, primary intended beneficiary is the public, whose access to knowledge copyright seeks to
advance by providing rewards for authorship."" /d. Thus, the fair use doctrine is a statutory exception to copyright
infringement, permitting the unauthorized use of a protected work for certain purposes such as criticism, comment, teaching,
scholarship, research, or, as relevant here, news reporting. 17 U.S.C. § 107.

""[T]he fair use determination is an open-ended and context sensitive inquiry,"" weighing four non-exclusive statutorily
provided factors in light of the purposes of copyright. Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 705 (2d Cir. 2013). The fair use
factors are (1) the purpose and character of the use; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the
potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107. The Second Circuit has held that these statutory
factors are not requirements and that the party requesting a judgment of fair use need not demonstrate that every factor
weighs in its favor. Cariou__714 F.3d at 705 . However, ""[t]he ultimate test of fair use is whether the copyright law's goal of
promoting the Progress of Science and useful Arts would be better served by allowing the use than by preventing it."" Castle
Rock, 150 F.3d at 141.

Although ""[flair use is a mixed question of law and fact,"" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 560 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 , the Second
Circuit has resolved fair use determinations at the summary judgment stage where the moving party shows there are no
genuine issues of material fact_Wright v. Warner Books, Inc. , 953 F.2d 731 , 735 (2d Cir. 1991) (""The fact-driven nature of
the fair use determination suggests that a district court should be cautious in granting Rule 56 motions in this area; however,
it does not protect the copyright holder from summary disposition of her claims where there are no material factual
disputes.""); see also Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp. . 137 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 1998) (affirming summary judgment
awarded to defendants on basis of fair use defense).

Specifically in cases pertaining to the media's secondary use of a copyrighted work, as in this matter, the Second Circuit has
consistently held that that ""First Amendment concerns are protected by and coextensive with the fair use doctrine."" Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, Inc. v. Comline Bus. Data, Inc. , 166 F.3d 65 , 74—75 (2d Cir. 1999) ;see also Twin Peaks Prods.. Inc. v.
Publications Int'l, Ltd., 996 F.2d 1366 , 1378 (2d Cir. 1993) (holding that ""except perhaps in an extraordinary case, ‘the fair
use doctrine encompasses all claims of First Amendment in the copyright field.’ "") (quoting New Era Pubs. Int'l, ApS v. Henry
Holt & Co.__873 F.2d 576 , 584 (2d Cir. 1989) ). Therefore, ""[w]hile an entity's status as a news publication may be highly
probative on certain relevant inquiries, such as whether that entity has a fair use defense to copyright infringement, it does
not render that entity immune from liability under intellectual property laws.""

[345 F.Supp.3d 427]


--- Page 6 ---
Sarl Louis Feraud Int'l v. Viewfinder, Inc. , 489 F.3d 474 , 480 (2d Cir. 2007). Otherwise stated, while free speech concerns
are clearly relevant to the fair use analysis, the First Amendment does not ""categorical[ly] protect[ ]"" against claims of
copyright infringement. /d. (""The fact that an entity is a news publication engaging in speech activity does not, standing
alone, relieve such entities of their obligation to obey intellectual property laws."").

i. Purpose and Character of the Work

The first factor, termed ""the heart of the fair use inquiry,"" looks to the purpose and character of the secondary use and
whether the use was for commercial or nonprofit educational purposes._On Davis v. The Gap. Inc. , 246 F.3d 152 , 174 (2d
Cir. 2001). The central purpose of the first factor is to determine ""whether and to what extent the work is transformative.""
Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.,510 U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) . ""If the secondary use
adds value to the original—if the copyrightable expression in the original work [must be] used as raw material, transformed
in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings—this is the very type of activity that the
fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society."" Castle Rock 150 F.3d at 141 (internal citations omitted);
see also Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. . 448 F.3d 605 , 608 (2d Cir. 2006) (observing that a transformative
use ""adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or
message."") (citing Campbell__510 U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ); Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust , 755 F.3d 87 , 96 (2d
Cir. 2014) (""A use is transformative if it does something more than repackage or republish the original copyrighted work."").
""With regard to photographs, ""[uJsing a photo for the precise reason it was created does not support a finding that the nature
and purpose of the use was fair."" See BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, Inc., 196 F.Supp.3d 395, 407 (S.D.N.Y.
2016).

First, to the extent that Defendant is arguing that its use of the Photograph in the article is fair because the Photograph was
created for personal use and Hearst used it for news, the Court is unpersuaded. Def.'s Memo. at 11-12. The Court has not
ound any law supporting this point, and the existing precedent requires the opposite conclusion. Though news reporting is
specifically named in 17 U.S.C. § 107 as a potential method of fair use, ""a news reporting purpose by no means guarantees""
such a finding. Harper & Row._471 U.S. at 557 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . The Second Circuit has recognized that in matters where
he secondary use falls under the category of news reporting, ""the need to convey information to the public accurately may
in some instances make it desirable and consonant with copyright law for a defendant to faithfully reproduce an original work
without alteration."" Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. , 756 F.3d 73 , 84 (2d Cir. 2014). When such uses are
ound to be transformative, courts often ""emphasiz[e] the altered purpose or context of the work, as evidenced by
surrounding commentary or criticism."" /d. To be clear, however, commentary is not necessary to the fair use defense, only
hat the secondary use provide ""new expression, meaning, or message"" to the original. Cariou__714 F.3d at 706 (""The law
imposes no requirement that a work comment on the original or its author in order to be considered transformative""). After
all, ""[t]he promise of copyright would be an empty one if it could be avoided merely by dubbing the infringement a fair use
‘news report ....’"" Harper & Row. 471 U.S. at 557 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; see also Swatch Grp.__ 756 F.3d at 85 (""A

345 F.Supp.3d 428]
news organization thus may not freely copy creative expression solely because the expression itself is newsworthy."").

It would be antithetical to the purposes of copyright protection to allow media companies to steal personal images and
benefit from the fair use defense by simply inserting the photo in an article which only recites factual information—much of
which can be gleaned from the photograph itself. If so, amateur photographers would be discouraged from creating works
and there would be no incentive for publishers to create their own content to illustrate articles: why pay to create or license
photographs if all personal images posted on social media are free grist for use by media companies, as Hearst argues
here? Indeed, it seems that this interpretation of the law would hinder ""the Progress of Science and useful Arts,"" U.S. Const.,
Art. |, § 8, cl. 8, and the creation of ""informative, intellectually enriching works for public consumption."" Google, Inc.__804
F.3d 202 , 212 (2d Cir. 2015).

The Court does not believe that this is an ""extraordinary case"" in which the need for news reporting should take precedence
over copyright protections. Twin Peaks_ 996 F.2d at 1378 ; see also Time Inc. v. Bernard Geis Assocs. , 293 F.Supp. 130 ,
146 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (holding that the defendants’ use of images from a copyrighted film on President Kennedy's
assassination was fair where there was a public interest in having the information available and the author presented his
own theory and explanation of the murder). Though ""news reporting is a widely-recognized ground for finding fair use under
the Copyright Act,"" the use of an image solely to illustrate the content of that image, in a commercial capacity, has yet to be
found as fair use in this District. BWP Media, 196 F.Supp.3d 395, 407 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) ; see also Barcroft Media, Ltd. v.
Coed Media Grp., LLC , 297 F.Supp.3d 339, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (""CMG's articles did not comment on, criticize, or report
news about the Images themselves; instead, they used the Images as illustrative aids because they depicted the subjects
described in its articles. CMG's argument, if accepted, would eliminate copyright protection any time a copyrighted
photograph was used in conjunction with a news story about the subject of that photograph. That is plainly not the law."").

Second, Hearst asserts that the article transformed the Photograph's purpose because Wade added commentary regarding
the President's availability for photographs at the wedding and a broader trend in the President's behavior. Def.'s Memo. at
13-17. Defendant supports this point by arguing that the image substantiates the story, as in Calkins v. Playboy Enterprises
Int'l_Inc. , 561 F.Supp.2d 1136 , 1141 (E.D. Cal. 2008), andNunez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp. , 235 F.3d 18 (1st Cir.
2000) , two cases which are not binding on this Court.



--- Page 7 ---
In any case, those two cases are distinguishable from the present facts. In Calkins, the article that used a copyrighted
photograph added biographical information to provide insights to the public on the personal life of the subject and in Nunez,
the photograph ""itself was the story"" where the media publisher reported on a controversy that arose because of the
copyrighted photograph. Here, unlike in Calkins and Nunez, the Esquire Article solely uses the Photograph for illustrative
purposes without adding ""new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings"" to the image, Castle Rock.
150 F.3d at 141 , in furtherance of ""the Progress of Science and useful Arts."" U.S. Const., Art. |, § 8, cl. 8. Hearst used the
Photograph for the same reason Otto took the Photograph: to depict a memorable event—the President's presence at a
private

[345 F.Supp.3d 429]

wedding. See Psihoyos v. Nat'l Exam'r, No. 97-cv-7624 (JSM), 1998 WL 336655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 22, 1998) (""The
Examiner's use is not transformative, because its piece uses the photo to show what it depicts.""). Otto took the picture of
President Trump with the bride because he wanted to capture something he determined was a noteworthy event. Esquire
reported on the wedding and published the Photograph for this same purpose. Even examining Esquire's use of the
Photograph from the wedding and the accompanying text as a whole, nothing about the article ""places it in a context
different from that in which it was displayed"" as a standalone image. BWP Media, 196 F.Supp.3d at 405.

The first factor also asks whether the image was used for a commercial or nonprofit educational purpose, where commercial
use tends to weigh against a finding of fair use. See NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst. _ 364 F.3d 471 (2d Cir. 2004) . ""The crux of
the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit
from exploitation of copyrighted material without paying the customary price."" Harper & Row. 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct.
2218 . If the court determines that the work was transformative, the commercial or nonprofit nature of the use has less
significance. Id. The Second Circuit has ""recognized that ‘[a]lmost all newspapers, books and magazines are published by
commercial enterprises that seek a profit.’ "" Swatch. 756 F.3d at 83 (alteration in original) (quoting Consumers Union of
U.S., Inc. v. Gen. Signal Corp. . 724 F.2d 1044 , 1049 (2d Cir. 1983) ). Accordingly, although a work may be commercial in
nature, courts ""do not place much significance on that fact"" when the work has been found to be transformative."" Cariou.,
714 F.3d at 708 . Here, Defendant does not dispute that it received advertising revenue from the Esquire Article, although,
because Defendant's use was not transformative, its commercial purpose has less significance. 3

[345 F.Supp.3d 430]

Because Defendant's use of the Photograph is not transformative and that use was commercial, the first factor weighs
against a finding of fair use.

ii. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second factor, which looks to the nature of the copyrighted work, weighs in favor of Hearst. In reviewing the second
factor, courts will determine whether a work is expressive or creative rather than factual or informational, and unpublished
versus published, with the scope of fair use applying more narrowly to creative and unpublished works. Blanch v. Koons
467 F.3d 244 , 256 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted);see also Harper & Row._471 U.S. at 563 -64, 105 S.Ct. 2218 .
""The law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy."" Harper & Row.
471 U.S. at 563 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; accord HathiTrust, 755 F.3d at 96 (""The second factor considers whether the copyrighted
work is of the creative or instructive type that the copyright laws value and seek to foster."" (internal citation omitted) ).

Photographs can vary on the spectrum of factual to creative. A photograph's informational purpose ""does not negate a
finding of imaginativeness or creativity."" Mathieson v. Associated Press , No. 90-cv-6945 (LMM), 1992 WL 164447, at *6
(S.D.N.Y. June 25, 1992). ""Although photographs are often ‘factual or informational in nature,’ the art of photography has
generally been deemed sufficiently creative to make the second fair use factor weigh in favor of photographer-plaintiffs.""
Baraban v. Time Warner, Inc. , No. 99-cv-1569 (JSM), 2000 WL 358375, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2000).

Plaintiff here asserts that the Photograph is creative, but does not offer any analysis beyond that conclusory statement.
However, unlike the staged photograph in Barbaran , the Photograph here was spontaneously taken to document its
subjects, as they were in the moment. Otto did not direct or pose the subjects of the photo, nor control the lighting or the
background. Based on these facts, the photograph is more factual than creative and narrowly favors Defendant. See N.
Jersey Media Grp. Inc. v. Pirro , 74 F.Supp.3d 605, 620 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (finding that the second factor favored fair use
where the defendant ""did not create the scene or stage his subjects—to the contrary, he plainly acknowledged that the
photograph ‘just happened.’ "").

Publicly released works qualify for far less protection from use by others than do unpublished materials. Harper & Row._471.
U.S. at 564 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . This is because a ""plaintiff's right to control the first public appearance of the [photo] is not
implicated [in such scenarios], nor does there exist any ‘race to publish,’ "" which lends itself to a finding of fair use.
Mathieson, 1992 WL 164447, at *6. Here, the parties do not dispute that the Photograph was widely disseminated and
previously published prior to Defendant's use. As such, Hearst's article did not threaten Otto's right of first publication.

Because the Photograph is factual and published, this factor weighs in favor of fair use. However, this Circuit has noted that


--- Page 8 ---
the second factor does not carry much weight in the fair use analysis and is ""rarely found to be determinative."" On Davis.
246 F.3d at 175 .

[345 F.Supp.3d 431]
iii. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

The third factor, ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole,"" weighs
against a finding of fair use. 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). Courts will ask ""whether the quantity and value of the materials used are
reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" Blanch__467 F.3d at 257 (citing Campbell__510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct.
1164 ). ""The more of a copyrighted work that is taken, the less likely the use is to be fair."" Infinity Broad. Corp. v. Kirkwood ,
150 F.3d 104 , 109 (2d Cir. 1998). The third factor of the fair use inquiry is influenced heavily by the first factor, focusing on
whether ‘the extent of ... copying’ is consistent with or more than necessary to further ‘the purpose and character of the use.’
"" Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 144 (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 —-87, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

Here, Hearst used a slightly cropped but otherwise unedited version of Otto's photograph. Plaintiff asserts that the article
could have been published without Otto's photograph, either relying on the text alone to convey the message, or on the
other two images used in the article which are not the subject of litigation. Pl.'s Memo. at 20. The Court declines to take a
position on the editorial decisions made by Defendant. The Court must additionally comment on Plaintiff's absurd position
that Defendant should have hired its own photographer to take photos of President Trump at the wedding. /d. It would
clearly be impossible for news companies, even ones as large as Hearst, to assign photojournalists to cover every single
potential news story, let alone one that occurred unexpectedly and at a private, closed event.

Hearst correctly states that using a protected work in entirety constitutes fair use when the purpose of the use requires it. Bill
Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 613 . Therefore, Hearst takes the position that the third factor is neutral at most because the
article's use of the entire photograph was reasonable in light of its asserted purpose—""to provide commentary on the
President's proclivity for seeking the attention of his fans and making himself available for photos and autographs."" Def.'s
Memo. at 11. Defendant heavily relies on Nunez for its position that using less of the photograph would have made the
photo useless to the story, and that a text-only article would not properly convey Hearst's message. However, this matter is
different from Nunez. As discussed above, in Nunez, a core part of the Court's analysis was rooted in the fact that the
newspaper's use of the photograph was transformative. Therefore, in that instance, providing a full-scale version of the
photograph provided much-needed context for potential readers to understand the piece. Nunez. 235 F.3d at 24 . In this
matter, where Hearst used the entirety of the image in an article that neither discussed the photograph itself nor transformed
its use, no reasonable factfinder could find that the third factor weighs in favor of Defendant.

iv. Effect of the Use on the Potential Market.

The fourth and last fair use factor examines the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work. 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). The inquiry requires courts to look to whether infringement will affect ""traditional, reasonable, or
likely to be developed markets."" Bill Graham Archives_, 448 F.3d at 614 (emphasis added). The harm to the value of the
original must be more than speculative, such as where the secondary use ""results in widespread revelation of

[345 F.Supp.3d 432

sufficiently significant portions of the original as to make available a significantly competing substitute."" Google, Inc.__ 804
F.3d at 223 . In short, this factor is ""concerned with secondary uses that, by offering a substitute for the original, usurp a
market that properly belongs to the copyright holder."" /nfinity Broad. Corp... 150 F.3d at 110 ; see Campbell,_510 U.S. at 590
, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (holding that courts are required to consider the extent of market harm in addition to ‘whether unrestricted
and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant ... would result in substantially adverse impact on the
potential market for the original.’ "") (quoting Nimmer § 13.05 [A][4] (at 13-187 in 1997 edition) ). Thus, ""[flair use, when
properly applied, is limited to copying by others which does not materially impair the marketability of the work which is
copied."" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566 -67, 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; see also Twin Peaks, 996 F.2d at 1377 (finding that the fourth
factor favored plaintiff where the secondary use ""risk[ed] impairment of the market for the copyrighted works themselves or
derivative works that the author is entitled to license.""). There also exists a ""close linkage between the first and fourth
factors, in that the more the copying is done to achieve a purpose that differs from the purpose of the original, the less likely
it is that the copy will serve as a satisfactory substitute for the original."" Google, Inc.__804 F.3d at 223 (citing Campbell__510
U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

The Second Circuit has ""recognized the danger of circularity in considering whether the loss of potential licensing revenue
should weight the fourth factor in favor of a plaintiff.""Ringgold v. Black Entm't Television, Inc., 126 F.3d 70 , 81 (2d Cir.
1997) (citing Am. Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc. , 60 F.3d 913 , 929 n.17, 931 (2d Cir. 1994) ). ""Since the issue is
whether the copying should be compensable, the failure to receive licensing revenue cannot be determinative in the
plaintiff's favor."" /d. ""Only an impact on potential licensing revenues for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed
markets should be legally cognizable when evaluating a secondary use's effect upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work."" Am. Geophysical, 60 F.3d at 930 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In cases where courts
have found the fourth factor to weigh in favor of the defendant, it was undisputed that Plaintiff had no intention of entering
the market, or was unable to take advantage of use in that manner. See Swatch_._756 F.3d at 91 (finding the fourth factor



--- Page 9 ---
weighed in favor of the defendant where the defendant conceded that it had no interest in exploiting the protected aspects
of the work); Pac. & S. Co. v. Duncan , 744 F.2d 1490 , 1496 (11th Cir. 1984) (noting that the fourth factor may not favor
copyright owner when the secondary user ""profits from an activity that the owner could not possibly take advantage of"").

This is not the case here. It is clear from Otto's communications with TMZ and Burke the morning after the wedding that he
did have an interest in entering the market upon realizing the value of his work. The creator of a work should not be
precluded from future profits should they lack the marketing prowess to capitalize on their work at the time of creation.
Duncan _, 744 F.2d at 1496 (""Copyrights protect owners who immediately market a work no more stringently than owners
who delay before entering the market.""). Otto's status as an amateur photographer with an iPhone does not limit his right to
engage in sales of his work.

Publishing the Photograph without permission essentially destroys the primary market for its use. As the owner of the
[345 F.Supp.3d 433]

work, Otto had the right to try to sell the Photograph to media outlets, if he decided to do so. The fact that the Photograph
was reported on so widely indicates that there was indeed a market for it. Hearst has done nothing to show that the general
audience for Otto's photograph would not be equally satisfied with its version. Thus, the publication can reasonably be
expected to harm Plaintiff's ability to license the work for publication and use in derivative works. Because the images are
nearly identical, Defendant's unauthorized publication impacts the market for the work—simply put, more supply, less
demand. If the practice of using photographs without licensing were to become widespread, ""the market for such images
would diminish correspondingly: [i]f media outlets could use such images for free, there would be little or no reason to pay

or works."" Barcroft , 297 F.Supp.3d at 355. Accordingly, the fourth factor weighs against a finding of fair use.
v. Balance

On balance, weighing the four non-exclusive factors in light of the purposes of copyright, the Court finds that Hearst's use of
he image was not fair. The fact that Hearst's commercial use did not transform the Photograph's purpose or add new
meaning to the image; the fact that Hearst used the work in its entirety; and the potential harm to any financial opportunities
Otto might reasonably pursue for use of the photo, outweigh the fact that the image is factual and published. Allowing a
news publisher to poach an image from an individual's social media account for an article that does little more than describe
he setting of the image does not promote ""the Progress of science and useful Arts."" U.S. Const., art. |, § 8, cl. 8 ; see Castle
Rock__150 F.3d at 141 . Accordingly, no reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of the Hearst on the issue of fair use and
Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the defense is granted.

The Court must remind the parties, however, of the ""fact-driven nature"" of the fair use inquiry and thus, the outcome may
have been different in a similar scenario. Wright v. Warner Books, Inc. . 953 F.2d 731 , 735 (2d Cir. 1991). It is not
unreasonable to think that the use could be considered fair in another matter involving a news publisher's incorporation of a
personal photograph. Though the Court did not find fair use in this particular instance, it does not preclude a finding of fair
use in other matters, depending on the balance of the fair use factors. Therefore, the Court emphasizes that a finding of fair
use in a matter involving personal photographs used by the media might be readily sustainable on facts other than those
presented here.

C. Other Defenses to Liability

Plaintiff has moved for summary judgment on Defendant's remaining affirmative defenses: (1) failure to state a claim; (2)
non-infringement; (3) waiver; (4) consent; and (5) release. Pl.'s Memo. at 23-24. Defendant has not responded to Plaintiff's
arguments concerning any of the defenses other than waiver and consent. However, Defendant's failure to oppose Plaintiff's
motion on those defenses does not in itself justify the granting of summary judgment. ""[W]here the non-moving party
‘chooses the perilous path of failing to submit a response to a summary judgment motion, the district court may not grant the
motion without first examining the moving party's submission to determine if it has met its burden of demonstrating that no
material issue of fact remains for trial.’"" Vermont Teddy Bear Co., Inc. v. 1-800 Beargram Co. , 373 F.3d 241, 244 (2d Cir.
2004) (quoting Amaker v. Foley . 274 F.3d 677 , 681 (2d Cir. 2001) ). Plaintiff here has met his burden of demonstrating

[345 F.Supp.3d 434]
that no material issue of fact exists and judgment is granted.

First, regarding Otto's alleged failure to state a claim: a complaint must plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is
plausible on its face."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 , 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) . ""A claim
has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the
defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868
(2009) . Here, Otto provided sufficient information in his complaint that allowed this Court to ""draw the reasonable inference""
that Hearst is liable for copyright infringement, and thus, judgment is granted in favor of Otto.

Second, as discussed above, there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding Otto's copyright infringement claim, and
the Court has found that Hearst is liable for infringement. Judgment is granted in favor of Otto on the defense of non-
infringement as well.


--- Page 10 ---
The third and fourth defenses are based on similar arguments and therefore the Court will discuss them together. Hearst
asserts that there are material questions of fact regarding whether Otto intended to waive his copyrights by sending the
photograph to Burke. Def.'s Memo. at 39. Similarly, Hearst argues that Otto's communications with Burke indicates that Otto
granted an implied license to use the Photograph and therefore consented to broad dissemination of the work. /d.

""To establish waiver, defendants must show that plaintiffs ‘relinquished a right with both knowledge of the existence of the
right and an intent to relinquish it."" Voest-Alpine Int'l Corp. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. , 707 F.2d 680 , 685 (2d Cir.
1983) (citations omitted). ""A waiver may arise by express agreement or by such conduct or failure to act as to evince an
intent not to claim the purported advantage."" Capito! Records, Inc. v. Naxos of Am., Inc. , 262 F.Supp.2d 204 , 211 (S.D.N.Y.
2003) (internal citations omitted). The Second Circuit has not yet developed a test for determining whether a copyright owner
has conveyed an implied license, however, it ""has followed the lead of other appeals courts and cautioned that implied non-
exclusive licenses should be found only in narrow circumstances where one party created a work at the other's request and
handed it over, intending that the other copy and distribute it."" Psihoyos v. Pearson Educ., Inc. , 855 F.Supp.2d 103 , 120
(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Weinstein Co. v. Smokewood Entm't Grp. , LLC, 664 F.Supp.2d 332 , 344 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) ). ""[T]he
question comes down to whether there was a ‘meeting of the minds’ between the parties to permit the particular usage at
issue."" Id. at 124 (citing Ulloa v. Universal Music and Video Distrib. Corp. , 303 F.Supp.2d 409 , 416 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) ).

Hearst asserts that in providing the photo to Burke without ""any restrictions on Mr. Burke's use or transmission of the
Snapshot""—which resulted in the Photograph being published on social media and news outlets like Hearst—Otto may have
intended to fully allow Burke to do ""anything he wanted"" with the Photograph. Def.'s Memo. at 39. However, in reviewing the
evidence in the record, namely, Otto's interactions with Burke and TMZ after the Photograph was published, and the
absence of any prior communication between Otto and Burke that could be construed as such a license, no reasonable jury
could find that Otto intended to waive his rights in the Photograph by texting it to Burke nor that Otto intended for Burke to
disseminate the Photograph. Even if Otto allowed Burke to share the image,

[345 F.Supp.3d 435]

there is no evidence that there was a similar agreement or ""meeting of the minds"" with Hearst, the party in this matter. Def.'s
56.1 Stmt. 9 64-62. As such, judgment is granted for Otto on the defenses of waiver and consent.

Finally, there is no evidence that Otto entered into an agreement with Hearst, or any other parties, to release his copyright
infringement claims. Both parties agree that Otto and Hearst had no communication prior to this suit and that Hearst did not
know Otto was the copyright owner of the Photograph until receiving the Complaint. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. §§ 64-66. Therefore,
the affirmative defense of release must similarly be granted.

D. Willfulness

Defendant has moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether its copyright infringement was willful. Def.'s Memo. at
40-42. The Court finds that, based on the record, a reasonable jury could differ as to whether Defendant is liable for willful
infringement under 17 U.S.C. § 504(c) and thus, summary judgment must be denied.

After establishing liability for copyright infringement, the copyright owner may elect to recover either statutory damages or
actual damages and profits. See 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1) (""[T]he copyright owner may elect, at any time before final judgment
is rendered, to recover, instead of actual damages and profits, an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved
in the action, with respect to any one work, for which any one infringer is liable ... in a sum of not less than $750 or more
than $30,000 as the court considers just.""). Should the copyright owner choose to recover statutory damages, the burden
falls on her to prove that the infringement is willful. /d. If the Court determines that the plaintiff has met that burden, it may, in
its discretion, enhance the statutory damages award up to $150,000 per infringed work. /d. § 504(c)(2). Alternatively, if the
infringer ""was not aware and had no reason to believe that"" its acts ""constituted an infringement,"" the Court may ""reduce the
award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200."" /d.

A copyright infringement is ""willful"" within the meaning of Section 504(c)(2) if plaintiff shows ""(1) that the defendant was
actually aware of the infringing activity, or (2) that the defendant's actions were the result of ‘reckless disregard’ for, or
‘willful blindness’ to, the copyright holder's rights."" /sland Software & Computer Serv., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. , 413 F.3d 257 ,
263 (2d Cir. 2005). In other words, defendant's knowledge may be inferred from his or her conduct._N.A.S. /mport, Corp. v.
Chenson Enterprises, Inc., 968 F.2d 250 , 252 (2d Cir.1992). While "" ‘[g]enerally speaking, summary judgment is not a tool
well suited to determining willfulness,’ "" Young-Wolff v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. , 12-cv-5230 (JPO), 2016 WL 154115, at *10
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 12, 2016) (quoting Close-Up Int'l, Inc. v. Berov , 382 F. App'x 113, 117 (2d Cir. 2010) ), "" [t]he summary
judgment rule would be rendered sterile ... if the mere incantation of intent or state of mind would operate as a talisman to
defeat an otherwise valid motion.’"" Res. Developers, Inc. v. Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Found., Inc. , 926 F.2d 134 , 141
(2d Cir. 1991) (quoting_Meiri v. Dacon , 759 F.2d 989 , 998 (2d Cir. 1985) ); see also Lipton v. Nature Co. , 71 F.3d 464 , 472
(2d Cir. 1995) (""Although courts are generally reluctant to dispose of a case on summary judgment when mental state is at
issue, it is permissible to do so where there are sufficient undisputed material facts on the record to make the question
appropriate for summary judgment.""). ""Nevertheless, at the summary judgment

[345 F.Supp.3d 436]


--- Page 11 ---
stage, although an inference of constructive knowledge or reckless conduct seems the better of the possible inferences that

can be drawn, we must still draw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party."" /sland Software_._413 F.3d 257 , 264 (2d
Cir. 2005).

Defendant argues that it is entitled to a finding of summary judgment that it did not willfully infringe because Plaintiff has not
satisfied his burden under Section 504(c)(2). It is clear here that Hearst did not have actual notice of its infringement. Def.'s
Memo. at 40. There is no evidence that Hearst knew of Otto's ownership of the Photograph before this suit was filed. The
issue then is whether Hearst had constructive knowledge of its infringement.

Otto asserts that the fact that Hearst is in the publishing business and has knowledge regarding copyright law and licensing
procedures supports a finding of willfulness, citing Fallaci v. New Gazette for this proposition. Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for
Summ. J. and Rep. to Def.'s Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (Dkt. No. 70) (""Pl.'s Rep."") at 32-33. In that case, the defendant
news publisher took an article originally published by the Washington Post and published a translation of it, using the original
article's photograph and author's name._Fallaci v. New Gazette Literary Corp. . 568 F.Supp. 1172 , 1173 (S.D.N.Y. 1983).
The court's finding in Fallaci that the defendant willfully infringed was based on defendant's position as the publisher of a
copyrighted newspaper and the fact that the defendant failed to appear and defend itself in the litigation. /d. However, it is
not clear to this Court that an entity's status as a media publisher alone can establish a reckless disregard for the copyright
holder's rights. Fallaciis consistent with other Second Circuit cases which have determined media publishers were willful
where the incriminating facts included more than just defendant's presence in an industry that frequently interacts with
copyright laws. See Fitzgerald Pub. Co. v. Baylor Pub. Co. , 807 F.2d 1110 , 1115 (2d Cir. 1986) (finding willfulness where
the defendant had a copy of the contract for which the limit of its use could have been ascertained and circulated internal
memoranda discussing those limits); Castle Rock Entm't v. Carol Pub. Grp., Inc. , 955 F.Supp. 260 , 267 (S.D.N.Y. 1997),
aff'd sub nom. Castle Rock Entm't.__ 150 F.3d 132 (finding willfulness where the defendants had constructive notice of the
infringement because they had experience with the copyright laws and the work included copyright information, as well as
actual notice of the infringement but continued to publish and distribute the work). In other words, in those cases,
defendants continued their infringement even ""after receiving a specific warning."" Twin Peaks_,_ 996 F.2d at 1382 (finding
willfulness where the defendant knew of the copyright in the work and continued its use even after it had been warned that it
was infringing).

Otto further argues that Hearst was ""willfully blind"" to the infringement because the supervising editor failed to review the
Photograph prior to publication, consult counsel, and inquire regarding the identity of the copyright holder. Pl.'s Rep. at 34—
35. However, the testimony of the supervising editor shows that he understood Wade to have complied with Hearst's custom
and practice in obtaining images from their owners. Sebastian Decl. 4 11. There is no evidence to the contrary and despite
the fact that discovery was completed here, Otto did not take the depositions of the Esquire Article's author or other Hearst
employees, or any other individuals who could attest to the Defendant's state of mind at the time of publication.

Otto also highlights the fact that Hearst removed the Photograph prior to the filing
[345 F.Supp.3d 437]

of the suit as evidence that Hearst acted willfully. Pl.'s Rep. at 1. Plaintiff cites no cases which support this conclusion. In
similar cases, willfulness was found when defendants had been informed of their potential infringement and still continued to
use the protected work. See N.A.S. Imp., 968 F.2d at 253 (holding that infringement was willful when the Defendant was
notified in several letters of the infringement and had agreed to stop selling the infringing items but failed to do so); Yurman
Studio. Inc. v. Castaneda , 591 F.Supp.2d 471 , 504 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (finding that a genuine dispute of material fact existed
where the defendants took several actions to prevent infringement, including stopping the sale of a number of infringing
products at plaintiff's request, precluding summary judgment for plaintiff). However, in this matter, unlike in Plaintiff's
interactions with another media outlet, TMZ, Plaintiff never contacted Hearst before filing the complaint. The parties do not
dispute that Otto never contacted Hearst, or that Hearst was never informed by Otto that its use of the photographs was
impermissible prior to this litigation.

However, there do exist issues of material fact that could result in a reasonable jury finding for Otto, precluding summary
judgment for Hearst. Otto points to the fact that Hearst has been sued numerous times in the recent past as evidence of
willfulness. A reasonable jury could find that this allegedly recurring pattern of infringement warrants a willful blindness for
acting in accordance with the copyright holder's rights, and therefore statutory damages. Walt Disney Co. v. Best , No. 88-
cv-1595 (SWk), 1990 WL 144209, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 1990) (""Shortly after agreeing to settle an earlier suit based on
its sales of unauthorized and counterfeit watches, WTD was found to be selling unauthorized and counterfeit Mickey Mouse
telephones. Defendant's past infringement is a strong indication that it was familiar with the law and willfully violated it."");
Lauratex Textile Corp. v. Allton Knitting Mills Inc. , 517 F.Supp. 900 , 903-04 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (""Moreover, it appears that
Levine, through other of his corporations, has been a defendant to copyright infringement suits brought by converters ten
times (including this action) in the last five years.... The inference is inescapable that Levine has made a practice of copying
the designs of other converters, and that an award of statutory damages is appropriate as a deterrent to further activity of
this kind."").

In addition, Defendant highlights the fact that it retrieved the Photograph from the Instagram account of Laura Piatowski and
credited Ms. Piatowski's Instagram account in its article. Def.'s Memo. at 40-41. However, this does not carry as much
weight as Defendant might hope: even if Defendant believed Ms. Piatowski to be the true owner and copyright owner of the


--- Page 12 ---
Photograph, there is no evidence in the record that would suggest that Hearst attempted to solicit a license or approval from
Ms. Piatowski prior to using the Photograph. See Sebastian Decl. ¥§ 10-11.

Based on the undisputed evidence in the record and viewing all facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable jury
could find that Hearst acted willfully when infringing on Otto's copyright and summary judgment must be denied.

V. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Otto's motion for partial summary judgment is GRANTED on the issues of Hearst's liability for
copyright infringement and Hearst's assertion of its affirmative defenses. Hearst's motion for partial summary judgment is
DENIED on both the issues of fair use and willfulness.

The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motions pending at Dkt. Nos. 36, 51, and 55.
SO ORDERED.

Notes:
1The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.

2 References to ""Def.'s 56.1 Stmt."" are to the Rule 56.1 statement and counterstatement submitted in connection with Hearst's motion for summary
judgment and in response to Otto's motion and Rule 56.1 statement. References to ""PI.'s Resp. to Def.'s 56.1 Stmt."" are to the Rule 56.1
counterstatement submitted by Otto in response to Hearst's motion and Rule 56.1 statement. In both cases, the Rule 56.1 counterstatements contain
both the assertions of the moving party and the responses of the non-moving party.

3 Though the nature of Defendant's conduct may be relevant to the first factor, Plaintiff misstates the law by implying that the Court is required to consider
""pad faith"" under the first factor, then corrects this point in a later footnote. Pl.'s Memo. at 10, 16 (compare ""Courts within the Second Circuit examine
three sub-factors to determine the purpose and character of use, including whether the secondary use is: (1) transformative; (2) for commercial
purposes; and (3) in bad faith."" with ""While Plaintiff is not aware of any case that requires the Court to consider the defendant's conduct, NX/VM Corp .
suggests that defendant's conduct may be weighed in the analysis of the first factor.""). Plaintiff asserts that Hearst acted in bad faith because it ""(a) failed
to provide attribution on the Photograph; (b) failed to conduct due diligence concerning the identity; (c) removed the infringing content from its website
after this lawsuit was filed; and (d) failed to consult counsel prior to publication."" The Court is not aware of any cases in this Circuit in which these factors
alone indicate bad faith on Defendant's part and reminds Plaintiff that bad faith is not determinative of the first factor's outcome. See NXIVM Corp._, 364
F.3d at 479 .

Regardless, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Defendant has acted in bad faith and this argument bears no weight on the first factor. Indeed, the cases
that Plaintiff relies on in support of this position are not on point. Plaintiff cites Rogers v. Koons in arguing that Hearst's failure to credit Otto when using
the Photograph demonstrates an ""absence of good faith and fair dealing."" Pl.'s Memo. at 17. However, Hearst did not take any affirmative action to
remove the copyright information from the Photograph, unlike the defendant in Rogers who tore the copyright mark off of the original work. See Rogers

v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301 , 309 (2d Cir. 1992). Plaintiff additionally cites Barcroft , 297 F.Supp.3d at 349, for its position that because Hearst took down the
Photograph after receiving the complaint, it does not harbor a good faith belief in its own defenses. PI.'s Memo. at 17. But Barcroft is not on point here.
The Barcroft court discussed the defendant's state of mind under the defense of waiver, and in any case, unlike the parties in Barcroft , Hearst and Otto
never engaged in licensing negotiations prior to the photo's removal.

Author: PER CURIAM:

Raanan Katz holds the copyright to a candid photograph (the Photo) of himself in which his tongue
protrudes askew from his mouth. Katz considers the Photo un7 flattering and embarrassing."" Irina Che-
valdina copied the Photo into several scathing blog posts she wrote about Katz and his business practices.
Katz appeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Chevaldina on his copyright infringement
claims, brought pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 501. Katz argues the district court erred in finding Chevaldina was
entitled to summary judgment based on her affirmative defense that her use of the Photo constituted fair use
under 17 U.S.C. § 107. Upon review, we affirm.

I. BACKGROUND

Katz is a minority investor in the Miami Heat basketball team and a commercial real estate tycoon who
owns and operates shopping centers through corporate entities collectively known as RK Centers. In
February 2011, Seffi Magriso, a professional photographer, took a photograph of Katz while Katz was
standing courtside at a basketball practice in Jerusalem. The Photo is a candid headshot of Katz in which his
eyebrows are arched sharply upwards and his tongue is sticking out of his mouth. In Katz’s opinion, the
Photo is “ugly,” “embarrassing,” and “compromis *1181 ing.” Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, published the
Photo online in an article about Katz’s interest in buying the Hapoel Jerusalem basketball team.

Chevaldina is a disgruntled former tenant in one of Katz’s shopping centers. She found the Photo
through a Google image search. Chevaldina created a blog devoted to sharply criticizing Katz and the
business practices of RK Centers. From May 3, 2011, to September 24, 2012, Chevaldina published 25 blog
posts that reproduced the Photo and criticized Katz. Chevaldina reproduced the Photo in her blog posts in

3/2/25, 6:39 PM - HeinOnline.org

three ways: (1) copied in its unaltered, original state; (2) accompanied by sharply worded captions; or (3)
cropped and pasted into mocking cartoons. For example, in a September 18, 2011 blog post where the Photo
was copied in its unaltered, original state, Chevaldina lambasted Katz for allegedly ripping off a “young
American Jewish single mother of [a] special needs child,” calling him “the most immoral human-being in
the world.” In a September 12, 2012, blog post, Chevaldina criticized Katz’s litigation strategies as frivolous
and copied the Photo with a caption across Katz’s chest that says, “HE RIPPED-OFF SPECIAL NEEDS
LITTLE JEWISH GIRL.” In a February 19, 2012, post about Katz’s preparation for a deposition, Chevaldina
cropped Katz’s face and superimposed it against a cartoon dunce hat.

On June 3, 2012, Magriso assigned all of his rights in the Photo to Katz. Katz then filed a complaint
against Chevaldina alleging direct copyright infringement.” The parties filed cross-motions for summary
judgment. The magistrate judge entered a Report and Recommendation (R & R) that recommended granting
summary judgment to Chevaldina because her use of the Photo constituted fair use. Katz timely filed
objections to the R & R. The district ’ court overruled the objections, adopted the R & R, and granted
summary judgment to Chevaldina. Katz timely appealed.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW

We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment, viewing all facts and reasonable
inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Beal v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 20 F.3d
454, 458-59 (11th Cir.1994). “Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact
and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id.; see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).

III. DISCUSSION

The only issue in this appeal is whether Chevaldina’s use of the Photo in her blog posts constitutes fair
use, as a matter of law, under Section 107 of the Copyright Act. Under Section 107, “[njotwithstanding the
provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work ... for purposes such as'criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is
not an infringement of copyright.” 17 U.S.C. § 107.

In deciding whether a defendant’s use of a work constitutes fair use, courts must weigh the following
four factors: (1) the purpose and character of the allegedly infringing use; (2) the nature of the copyrighted
work; (3) the amount of the copyrighted work used; (4) and the effect of the use on the potential market or
value of the copyrighted work. Id. These four statutory factors are not to be treated in isolation from one
another. See Campbell *1182 v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 1170-71, 127
L.Ed.2d 500 (1994). Rather, they are “[a]ll are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of
the purposes of copyright.” Id., 510 U.S. at 578, 114 S.Ct. at 1171. Based on our weighing of the factors
discussed below, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Chevaldina because her use
of the Photo in each blog post constituted fair use.? We discuss each factor in turn.

A. Purpose and Character of the Work

The first factor — the purpose and character of- the allegedly infringing work — requires consideration
of “(1) whether the use serves a nonprofit educational purpose, as opposed to a commercial purpose; and (2)
the degree to which the work is a transformative use, as opposed to a merely superseding use, of the
copyrighted work.” Peter Letterese & Assocs., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enters., 533 F.3d 1287, 1309
(11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). The district court did not err in concluding Chevaldi-na’s use of the
work was both noncommercial and transformative.

Every use of the Photo on the blog was of a primarily educational, rather than commercial, character.
Chevaldina unabashedly criticized and commented on the dealings of Katz, his businesses, and his lawyers.
Chevaldina’s blog posts sought to warn and educate others about the alleged nefariousness of Katz, and she
made no money from her use of the photo. See 17 U.S.C. § 107 (designating “criticism” and “comment” as fair
use).

Katz argues the Photo served a primarily commercial purpose because, in a March 4, 2012, blog post,
Chevaldina said she was “in the process of writing a book ‘Why RK Centers Was The Wrong Choice.’ ” Thus,
Katz argues, Chevaldina used the Photo to advertise for commercial book sales. Che-valdina’s reference to

https://heinonline.org/HOL/CaseLawaA Iterative ?native_id=11687063&cop=&collection=all 2/5


--- Page 3 ---
3/2/25, 6:39 PM - HeinOnline.org
her intention to write a book about her experiences with Katz does not alone, however, transform the blog
post into a commercial venture. Overall, the blog post retains her educational purpose of lambasting Katz
and deterring others from conducting business with him. See March 4, 2012 Blog Post (“I hope my book will
help ambitious people in their dream to be successful without selling the[ir] soul to the [d]evil.”). Moreover,
the link between Chevaldina’s commercial gain and her copying of the Photo was attenuated given that
Chevaldina never wrote a book nor made any profits whatsoever. See Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v.
Bloomberg L.P., 756 F.3d 73, 83 (2d Cir.2014) (discounting commercial nature of use where “the link
between the defendant’s commercial gain and its copying is attenuated such that it would be misleading to
characterize the use as commercial exploitation” (quotations and alterations omitted)).

Chevaldina’s use of the Photo was also transformative. A use is transformative when it “adds something
new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or
message.” See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. at 1171. Chevaldina’s use of the Photo was transformative
because, in *1183 the context of the blog post’s surrounding commentary, she used Katz’s purportedly “ugly”
and “compromising” appearance to ridicule and satirize his character. See Swatch, 756 F.3d at 84 (“Courts
often find such uses [of faithfully reproduced works] transformative by emphasizing the altered purpose or
context of the work, as evidenced by the surrounding commentary or criticism.”); A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye v.
iParadigms, LLC, 562 F.3d 630, 639 (4th Cir.2009) (“The use of a copyrighted work need not alter or
augment the work to be transformative in nature.”); Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 268 F.3d 1257,
1270 (11th Cir.2001) (finding trans-formative use where work was “principally and purposefully a critical
statement”).

Chevaldina’s use of the Photo was noncommercial and transformative. Accordingly, the first factor
weighs in favor of fair use.

B. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second fair use factor — the nature of the copyrighted work — “recognizes that there is a hierarchy
of copyright protection in which original, creative works are afforded greater protections than derivative
works or factual compilations.” Suntrust, 268 F.3d at 1271. In evaluating this factor, courts consider (1)
whether the work was previously published and (2) whether the work is primarily creative or factual. See
Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 563-64, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 2232, 85 L.Ed.2d
588 (1985).

There is no dispute that the Photo was published prior to Chevaldina’s use. As such, the time of
publication weighs in favor of fair use. See Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811, 820 (9th Cir.2003)
(holding publication of images on internet before defendant’s copying favored fair use).

The district court did not err in finding the Photo was primarily a factual work. “The law generally
recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy.” Harper & Row, 471
USS. at 563, 105 S.Ct. at 2232. Photography is an art form that may require the photographer to make many
important creative decisions. See Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 137 F.3d 109, 116 (2d Cir.1998)
(stating a photographer “is entitled to protection for such artistic elements as the particular lighting, the
resulting skin tone on the subject, and the camera angle that she selected”). The Photo, however, is merely a
candid shot in a public setting, and there is no evidence in the record that Magriso, the photographer,
attempted to convey ideas, emotions, or in any way influence Katz’s pose, expression, or clothing. See
Fitzgerald v. CBS Broad., Inc., 491 F.Supp.2d 177, 188 (D.Mass.2007) (concluding candid photograph of
mobster leaving police station was a primarily factual work). While Magriso’s photojournalistic timing was
fortuitous (at least from Chevaldina’s perspective), this alone was not enough to make the creative gilt of the
Photo predominate over its plainly factual elements.

The Photo was previously published and primarily factual. The second factor therefore weighs in favor
of.fair use.

C. Amount of the Work Used

The third factor is “the amount and substantiality of. the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). A court must ask whether the defendant has “helped [herself] overmuch
to the copyrighted work in light of the purpose and character of the use.” Peter Letterese & Assocs., 533 F.3d

https://heinonline.org/HOL/CaseLawaA Iterative ?native_id=11687063&cop=&collection=all 3/5


--- Page 4 ---
3/2/25, 6:39 PM - HeinOnline.org
at 1314 (quotation omitted). This factor “weighs less when considering a photograph — where all or most of
the work of #1184 ten must be used in order to preserve any-meaning at all — than a work such as a text or
musical composition, where bits and pieces can be excerpted without losing all value.” Fitzgerald, 491
F.Supp.2d at 188; see Seltzer v. Green Day, Inc., 725 F.3d 1170, 1178 (9th Cir.2013) (“[U]nlike an episode of
the Ed Sullivan show or a book manuscript, [a drawing] is not meaningfully divisible.”).

The district court did not err in finding the third factor was neutral as applied to the' blog posts
incorporating the Photo. Though ten blog posts reproduced the Photo in its entirety and without alteration,
to copy any less of .the image “would have made the picture useless to [Cheval-dina’s] story” that Katz is a
predatory commercial landlord. See Niifiez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp., 235 F.3d 18, 24 (1st Cir.2000). As
such, the third factor neither weighs for nor against a finding of fair use.

D. Effect of the Use on the Potential Market for the Work

The fourth factor is “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work.” 17 U.S.C. 107(4). The “central question” is whether, assuming that everyone engaged in the conduct of
the defendant, the use “would cause substantial economic harm such that allowing [the conduct] would
frustrate the purposes of copyright by materially impairing [the defendant’s] incentive to publish the work.”
Cambridge Univ. Press v. Patton, 769 F.3d 1232, 1276 (11th Cir.2014).

The district court did not err in finding Chevaldina’s use of the Photo would not materially impair
Katz’s incentive to publish the work. Katz took the highly unusual step of obtaining the copyright to the
Photo and initiating this lawsuit specifically to prevent its publication. Katz profoundly distastes the Photo
and seeks to extinguish, for all time, the dissemination of his “embarrassing” countenance. Due to Katz’s
attempt to utilize copyright as an instrument of censorship against unwanted criticism, there is no potential
market for his work. While we recognize that even an author who disavows any intention to publish his work
“has the right to change his mind,” see Monge v. Maya Magazines, Inc., 688 F.3d 1164, 1181 (9th Cir.2012)
(quotation omitted), the likelihood of Katz changing his mind about the Photo is, based on the undisputed
evidence in the record, incredibly remote. Since there is no evidence Chevaldina’s use of the Photo had or
would have any impact upon any actual or potential market, the fourth factor weighs in favor of fair use.

IV. CONCLUSION

Three factors in our fair use inquiry— the purpose and character of the work, the nature of the work,
and the effect of the use on the potential market — weigh in favor of Chevaldina. The amount and sub-
stantiality of the work is neutral. After weighing all four factors, our analysis tilts strongly in favor of fair use.
The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Chevaldina because every reasonable
factfinder would conclude the inclusion of the Photo in her blog posts constituted fair use.

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Chevaldina.*
AFFIRMED.

1 . We make no independent determination as to whether the Photo is unflattering or embarrassing. Construing the
evidence in the light most favorable to Katz for the purposes of summary judgment, however, we accept Katz’s own

characterizations of the Photo as aesthetically displeasing.

2 . Katz's original complaint also named Google Inc. as a defendant for contributory copyright infringement. Katz
hied an amended-complaint omitting Google Inc. as a defendant, but retaining the direct copyright infringement claim

against Chevaldina.

3 . Katz argues the district court erred by failing to perform a “work-by-work” analysis of the blog posts, see
Cambridge Univ. Press v. Patton, 769 F.3d 1232, 1259 (11th Cir.2014), and instead analyzed only the blog posts
containing altered versions of the Photo. This argument lacks merit. In the R & R adopted by the district court, the
magistrate judge outlined all 25 allegedly infringing blog posts, and noted that its finding of fair use applied to each post.
Therefore, the district court did, in fact, perform the required ""work-by-work” analysis. The district court was not
required to write a prolix, unwieldy opinion with 25 separate sections devoted to each alleged instance of infringement.

OPINION AND ORDER
VALERIE CAPRONI, United States District Judge:

Multimedia System Design, Inc. d/b/a ""Crowdsource the Truth"" (""MSDI"") produces video content that, inter alia , traffics in
wild conspiracy theories. In June 2020, MSDI used an image of the Emmy Award Statuette holding a model of the COVID-
19 virus as part of a video honoring countries that downplayed the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. Plaintiffs, The
National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, Inc. (""NATAS"") and Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (""ATAS"")
(collectively, the ""Television Academies""), owners of the Emmy Statuette design, took exception and sued. Am. Compl., Dkt.

DISCUSSION

To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, ""a complaint must allege
sufficient facts, taken as true, to state a plausible claim for relief."" Johnson v. Priceline.com, Inc. 711 F.3d 271 , 275 (2d Cir.
2013) (citing_Bel/ Atl. Corp. v. Twombly . 550 U.S. 544 , 555-56, 127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) ). A complaint
need not ""contain detailed or elaborate factual allegations, but only allegations sufficient to raise an entitlement to relief
above the

[551 F.Supp.3d 420]

speculative level."" Keiler v. Harlequin Enters. Ltd. , 751 F.3d 64 , 70 (2d Cir. 2014). On a motion to dismiss, the Court must
accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the
plaintiffs. Gibbons v. Malone , 703 F.3d 595 , 599 (2d Cir. 2013). The Court is not, however, ""bound to accept as true a legal
conclusion couched as a factual allegation."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal _556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)
(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 ).

|. Defendant's Partial Motion to Dismiss is Denied 5
A. Copyright Infringement Claim

To prevail on a claim of copyright infringement, ""a plaintiff with a valid copyright must demonstrate that: (1) the defendant
has actually copied the plaintiffs work; and (2) the copying is illegal because a substantial similarity exists between the
defendant's work and the protectible elements of [the] plaintiff's."" Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Dev. Corp.

602 F.3d 57 , 63 (2d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). To establish substantial similarity, a plaintiff must show, inter alia , that the
copying is ""more than de minimis."" Tufenkian Imp./Exp. Ventures. Inc. v. Einstein Moomijy. Inc. , 338 F.3d 127 , 131 (2d Cir.
2003).

Defendant does not dispute that the Television Academies have valid copyrights for the Emmy Statuette or that Defendant
copied the Emmy Statuette. Def. Opp., Dkt. 50 at 2. Instead, Defendant argues that its use of the Emmy Statuette is not
actionable because the use was either de minimis or fair use. The Court disagrees.

1. Defendant's Infringement Was Not De Minimis

To establish that the infringement of a copyright is de minimis , a defendant must show that its copying of protected material
is ""so trivial"" as to ""fall below the quantitative threshold of substantial similarity."" Ringgold v. Black Ent. Television. Inc. , 126
F.3d 70 , 74 (2d Cir. 1997). In cases involving visual works, such as the instant case, whether the defendant's copying isle

minimis depends on the ""observability"" of the copied work, including ""the length of time the copied work is observable in the
allegedly infringing work and such factors as focus, lighting, camera angles, and prominence."" /d. at 75. The assessment is

to be made from the viewpoint of an ""average lay observer."" Sandoval v. New Line Cinema Corp. . 147 F.3d 215 , 218 (2d
Cir. 1998).

Here, the Crony Graphic appears prominently for the opening ten seconds of Defendant's Video. The Crony Graphic is in
clear focus in the foreground of the Video and occupies much of the screen. See Video at 00:00 to 00:10. The Crony
Graphic is also used as the thumbnail image for the Video, making the Crony Graphic perpetually visible even before a user
plays the video. See Video at 00:00; Am. Answer at 3 § 4. Accordingly, Defendant's infringement was not de minimis. See
On Davis v. The Gap, Inc. , 246 F.3d 152 , 173 (2d Cir. 2001) (holding that defendant's infringement was

[551 F.Supp.3d 421]

not de minimis because the infringing item was ""highly noticeable"" and appeared ""at the center"" of the advertisement);
Hirsch v. CBS Broad. Inc. , No. 17-CV-1860, 2017 WL 3393845, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2017) (holding that defendant's
infringement was not de minimis because defendant ""display[ed] a substantial proportion"" of the allegedly infringing photo,
""occup[ying] much, although not all, of the screen""); Dyer v. V.P. Recs. Retail Outlet, Inc. , No. 05-CV-6583, 2008 WL
2876494, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 24, 2008) (holding that defendant's infringement was not de minimis because the offending


--- Page 3 ---
images ""[took] up most of the screen"" for ""almost three seconds of the one-minute video""); Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.
v. Marvel Enters., Inc. , 155 F. Supp. 2d 1 , 46 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), remanded on other grounds , 277 F.3d 253 (2d Cir. 2002)
(rejecting defendant's argument that its use was de minimis because the copied clips ""appear[ed] prominently and [were]
plainly observable to the lay viewer""). &

2. Defendant's Use of the Emmy Statuette Is Not Fair Use

Fair use is a statutory exception to copyright infringement._Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. , 448 F.3d 605 ,
608 (2d Cir. 2006). As codified in the Copyright Act, ""the fair use of a copyrighted work ... for purposes such as criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching ..., scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright."" 17 U.S.C. § 107. To
determine whether a particular use is fair use, courts engage in a case-by-case evaluation using four statutory factors in light
of the purposes of copyright. Bill Graham__448 F.3d at 608 . The factors include: (1) the purpose and character of the use,
including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the
copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107. Although a court
must weigh all the factors, the first—in particular a use's ""transformativeness""—is most important and ""has a significant
impact on the remainder of the fair use inquiry."" Graham v. Prince , 265 F. Supp. 3d 366, 380 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). Because fair
use is a ""mixed question of fact and law"" and requires ""an open-ended and context-sensitive inquiry,"" courts generally wait
until the summary judgment phase to address fair use. /d. at 376-77. Nevertheless, dismissal of a copyright infringement
claim is warranted at the pleadings stage where fair use is clearly established on the face of the complaint. TCA Television
Corp. v. McCollum , 839 F.3d 168 , 178 (2d Cir. 2016).

a. Purpose and Character of the Use

The heart of the fair use inquiry is the purpose and character of the use. Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 251 (2d Cir.
2006). This includes two considerations: (i) the transformative nature of the work, and (ii) whether the ""use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational

[551 F.Supp.3d 422]

purposes."" Bill Graham_, 448 F.3d at 608 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 107(1) ).

i. Transformative Use

To determine whether a secondary use is transformative, the Court must consider ""whether the new work merely
supersede[s] the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different
character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message."" Bill Graham__448 F.3d at 608 (quoting_Campbell v.
Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ). To be transformative, ""the
secondary work itself must reasonably be perceived as embodying an entirely distinct artistic purpose, one that conveys a
‘new meaning or message’ entirely separate from its source material."" Andy Warhol Found. for the Visual Arts, Inc. v.
Goldsmith , 992 F.3d 99 , 113 (2d Cir. 2021) (emphasis added). Put differently, although the primary work may still be
recognizable within the secondary work, ""the secondary work's use of its source material"" must be ""in service of a
‘fundamentally different and new’ artistic purpose and character, such that the secondary work stands apart from the ‘raw
material’ used to create it."" /d. at 114. Paradigmatic examples of transformative uses include parody, criticism, comment,
news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. /d. at 110.

Defendant argues that its use of the Emmy Statuette is transformative because the Crony Graphic changed the Emmy
Statuette's meaning ""by having a symbol of the television industry holding up a depiction of the COVID virus,"" resulting in ""a
unique and startling image that invites interpretation."" Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 10. The Court disagrees. Defendant has
made no substantial alterations to the Emmy Statuette; the Crony Graphic is identical to the Emmy Statuette save the
replacement of the atom with an image of the COVID-19 virus. Put differently, a simple side-by-side comparison of the
Emmy Statuette and the Crony Graphic confirms that the Crony Graphic retains the dominant and essential aesthetic
elements of the Emmy Statuette._Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 711 (2d Cir. 2013) (finding that secondary works that
made only ""minimal alterations,"" so that the secondary works remained ""similar [to the original] in key aesthetic ways,"" were
not transformative). The Crony Graphic is nothing more than the ""imposition of another artist's style on the primary work
such that the secondary work remains both recognizably deriving from, and retaining the essential elements of, its source
material."" Warhol, 992 F.3d at 114 . Accordingly, Defendant's use of the Emmy Statuette is not transformative.See Graham
v. Prince , 265 F. Supp. 3d at 381 (rejecting fair use defense where the secondary work ""simply reproduce[d] the entirety of
[the original]"" so that the ""unobstructed and unaltered"" original remained ""the dominant image in [the secondary work]""); N.
Jersey Media Grp. Inc. v. Pirro , 74 F. Supp. 3d 605, 615 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (finding that a secondary work, which juxtaposed
the plaintiff's work with an iconic World War II photograph, was not transformative because the plaintiff's work remained ""the
clearly predominant feature of the [clombined [i]mage"").

Defendant's assertion that the Crony Graphic was created ""to promote a serious discussion"" of the COVID-19 pandemic is
insufficient to establish transformativeness. Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 10. At the outset, whether a secondary work is
transformative does not turn on the stated or perceived intent of its creator. See Warhol__ 992 F.3d at 113 (noting that ""where



--- Page 4 ---
a
551 F.Supp.3d 423]

secondary work does not obviously comment on or relate back to the original or use the original for a purpose other than

hat for which it was created, the bare assertion of a ‘higher or different artistic use’ is insufficient to render a work
ransformative""). Instead, as noted supra , the Court must examine whether the ""secondary work's use of its source material
is in service of a ‘fundamentally different and new’ artistic purpose and character, such that the secondary work stands apart
rom the ‘raw material’ used to create it."" /d. at 114. Here, the Crony Graphic appeared in videos and social media posts
promoting Defendant's Crony Awards, an award show that honored countries and people who minimized the COVID-19
pandemic. As such, the Crony Graphic does not have a ""fundamentally different and new artistic purpose and character,""
rom the Emmy Statuette. Instead, both images represent awards and were used to promote the parties' respective award
shows. See TCA Television Corp._, 839 F.3d at 180 —83 (rejecting fair use defense where the secondary work did not ""imbue
the original] with a character[ ] different from that for which it was created"").

Finally, Defendant's argument that its use of the Emmy Statuette constitutes parody is unavailing. See Am. Answer at 26-28
qf 22, 24, 27. ""To constitute a parody, a work must be directed, at least in part, at the original, and its ‘commentary [must
have] critical bearing on the substance or style of the original.’ "" Abilene Music, Inc. v. Sony Music Ent.. Inc. , 320 F. Supp.
2d 84 , 91 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 580 -81, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ); see also Warhol, 992 F.3d at 110
(noting that ""parody [ ] needs to mimic an original to make its point""). A secondary work that simply appropriates material
from an existing work without directing its criticism at the copied work itself is not parody. Abilene Music, Inc.._320 F. Supp.
2d at 91 . Defendant admits that ""[nJeither the Emmy statuette nor the Television Academies were mentioned in the
broadcast."" Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 7; see also Pls.' Motion for Judicial Notice, Dkt. 37-1, Ex. 4, at 10:30 to 11:00
(stating that the Television Academies ""narcissistically think [the Crony Awards] was referring to them""). Accordingly, the
Crony Graphic is not parody.

ii. Commercial Use

In evaluating the purpose and character of the use, the Court must also consider ""whether such use is of a commercial
nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). The more transformative the new work, however, ""the
less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; Cariou_ 714
F.3d at 708 .

Defendant argues that its use of the Emmy Statuette is not commercial because Mr. Goodman derives no income from his
YouTube broadcasts. Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 11. While Defendant may not derive direct income from its YouTube
content, Defendant's Video included links to Patreon and SubscribeStar, through which consumers pay for Defendant's

content. 8 Accordingly, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the Crony Graphic was used commercially. See
[551 F.Supp.3d 424]

Hirsch v. Complex Media, Inc. , No. 18-CV-5488, 2018 WL 6985227, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 2018) (finding that defendant's
copying ""for commercial purposes ... adjacent to advertisements"" gave rise to ""inferences of commercial use and bad faith"").

In sum, the first factor weighs against a finding of fair use.
b. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second fair use factor considers: ""(1) whether the work is expressive or creative, ... with a greater leeway being allowed
to a claim of fair use where the work is factual or informational, and (2) whether the work is published or unpublished, with
the scope for fair use involving unpublished works being considerably narrower."" Cariou_, 714 F.3d at 709 -10.

Because Defendant concedes that the Emmy Statuette is ""arguably creative,"" Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 11, this factor
weighs against a finding of fair use.

c. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

The third fair use factor considers whether ""the quantity and value of the materials used[ ] are reasonable in relation to the
purpose of the copying."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . In general, ""the more of a copyrighted work that is

taken, the less likely the use is to be fair."" Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. , 756 F.3d 73 , 89 (2d Cir.
2014).

As noted supra , the Crony Graphic copies nearly all of the Emmy Statuette; the two images are identical other than the
replacement of the atom with the COVID-19 virus. See Hirsch v. CBS Broad. Inc. , 2017 WL 3393845, at *7 (rejecting fair
use defense where the defendant ""simply reproduced a substantial proportion of the [original]"" and then ""insert[ed] it into a
broadcast""). Moreover, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendant's use of the Emmy Statuette was unreasonable in
relation to its purpose. Even assuming that Defendant needed to use an image of an award to promote its Crony Awards,
Defendant has not shown that it was necessary to use the Emmy Statuette. See TCA Television Corp.__839 F.3d at 185
(finding that wholesale borrowing of copyrighted comedy routine was not reasonable where ""defendants offer[ed] no



--- Page 5 ---
persuasive justification"" for its use).
Accordingly, the third factor weighs against a finding of fair use.
d. Effect of the Use Upon the Market for or Value of the Original

The final fair use factor considers ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" 17
U.S.C. § 107(4). This factor ""focuses on whether the copy brings to the marketplace a competing substitute for the original,
or its derivative, so as to deprive the rights holder of significant revenues because of the likelihood that potential purchasers
may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original."" Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 223 (2d Cir. 2015).
In assessing market harm, the Court must consider ""not whether the second work would damage the market for the first (by,
or example, devaluing it through parody or criticism), but whether it usurps the market for the first by offering a competing
substitute."" Warhol, 992 F.3d at 120 . The more transformative the secondary use, ""the less likelihood that the secondary
use substitutes for the original."" Graham v. Prince , 265 F. Supp. 3d at 384 (citation omitted); see also Warhol, 992 F.3d at
120 (noting that the first and fourth factors are closely linked because ""the more the copying is done to achieve a purpose
hat differs from the purpose of the original, the less likely it is that the

551 F.Supp.3d 425]
copy will serve as a satisfactory substitute for the original"").

The Court agrees with Defendant that the primary markets for the Emmy Awards and Defendant's video series do not
meaningfully overlap. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that they suffered actual and reputational harm
through Defendant's association of the Emmy Statuette with dangerous misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. See
Am. Compl. {1 31, 49, 58, 61. Defendant has alleged no facts to support its conclusory assertion that its use of the Crony
Graphic had ""[no] impact whatsoever"" upon the market value of the Emmy Statuette. See Campbell_, 510 U.S. at 590 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 (""Since fair use is an affirmative defense, its proponent would have difficulty carrying the burden of demonstrating
fair use without favorable evidence about relevant markets."").

In sum, this factor weighs slightly against a finding of fair use.
e. Balance of the Factors

For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the balance of the fair use factors weighs against a finding of fair use at
this stage. Therefore, Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ copyright infringement claim is denied because Defendant's
use was not, as a matter of law, either de minimis or fair use.

B. Trademark Dilution Claims

To allege a trademark dilution claim under federal law, a plaintiff must prove (1) that the trademark is truly distinctive or has
acquired secondary meaning, and (2) a likelihood of dilution as a result of blurring or tarnishment. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1) ;
see also Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay Inc._, 600 F.3d 93 , 110-11 (2d Cir. 2010) ; Ergowerx Int'l, LLC v. Maxell Corp. of Am. , 18
F. Supp. 3d 430, 451 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). 2

Dilution by blurring is an ""association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that
impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark."" 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)(B) ; see also Tiffany (NJ) Inc.__600 F.3d at 111
(blurring refers to ""the whittling away of the established trademark's selling power through its unauthorized use by others"").
In determining whether a mark is likely to cause dilution by blurring, courts consider: (1) the degree of similarity between the
mark or trade name and the famous mark; (2) the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark; (3) the
extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in substantially exclusive use of the mark; (4) the degree of
recognition of the famous mark; (5) whether the user of the mark intended to create an association with the famous mark;
and (6) any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)(B)(i-vi).

Dilution by tarnishment is an ""association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that
harms the reputation of the famous mark."" 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)(C). ""Tarnishment generally arises when the plaintiff's
trademark is linked to products of shoddy quality, or is portrayed in an unwholesome or unsavory context likely to evoke
unflattering thoughts about the owner's

[551 F.Supp.3d 426]

product."" Deere & Co. v. MTD Prod., Inc. , 41 F.3d 39 , 43 (2d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Like the Copyright Act, the Trademark Dilution Act includes a fair use exception, which provides that certain types of uses
are not actionable as dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment, including:

Any fair use ... of a famous mark by another person other than as a designation of source for the person's own
goods or services, including use in connection with ... identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon
the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous mark owner.

15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3). 12


--- Page 6 ---
Here, Defendant argues that the fair use exception applies because its use of the Crony Graphic was parody or social
commentary. The Court disagrees. The parody exception does not apply when the purported parody ""makes no comment""
on the original mark, and ""simply uses it somewhat humorously to promote [its] own products and services."" Harley
Davidson, Inc. v. Grottanelli, 164 F.3d 806 , 813 (2d Cir. 1999). As noted supra , Defendant concedes that its Video does not
mention either the Emmy Statuette or the Television Academies, see Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 7, and nothing about its
use of the Crony Graphic pokes fun at or comments on the Television Academies. Accordingly, the parody exception does
not apply. Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Hyundai Motor Am. , No. 10-CV-1611, 2012 WL 1022247, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22,
2012) (finding parody exception inapplicable when defendant acknowledged its ""overall intent was not to comment directly
on [the trademark holder]""). Similarly, although Defendant argues that its use of the Crony Graphic ""qualifies as social
commentary on the television industry and its role in creating public perceptions,"" Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 14, the fair
use exception does not apply to ""expansive social criticism, as opposed to a targeted comment or parody of the original.""
Hyundai Motor Am. , 2012 WL 1022247, at *19.

In sum, the fair use exception does not, as a matter of law, defeat Plaintiffs’ trademark dilution claims. 1+

C. Trademark Infringement Claims

To state a claim for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to establish: (1) that
the plaintiff's mark is entitled to protection, and (2) that the defendant's ""use of its mark is likely to cause consumers
confusion as to the origin or sponsorship of [its] goods.""

[551 F.Supp.3d 427]

Guthrie Healthcare Sys. v. ContextMedia, Inc. , 826 F.3d 27 , 37 (2d Cir. 2016).12A certificate of registration with the Patent
and Trademark Office is prima facie evidence that the mark is entitled to protection. /d.

""Likelihood of confusion includes confusion of any kind, including confusion as to source, sponsorship, affiliation,
connection, or identification."" Star Indus., Inc. v. Bacardi & Co._. 412 F.3d 373 , 383 (2d Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). In
assessing whether a likelihood of confusion exists, courts apply the well-known eight-factor balancing test announced in
Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elecs. Corp. , 287 F.2d 492 , 495 (2d Cir. 1961). The eight factors include: (1) strength of the
trademark; (2) similarity of the marks; (3) proximity of the products and their competitiveness with one another; (4) evidence
that the senior user may ""bridge the gap"" by developing a product for sale in the market of the alleged infringer's product; (5)
evidence of actual consumer confusion; (6) evidence that the imitative mark was adopted in bad faith; (7) respective quality
of the products; and (8) the sophistication of consumers in the relevant market._Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe's Borough Coffee.
Inc. , 588 F.3d 97 , 115 (2d Cir. 2009). The application of thePo/aroid test is not ""mechanical,"" and no single factor is
dispositive. Guthrie Healthcare Sys._, 826 F.3d at 37 . Rather, a court must focus on whether the plaintiff has plausibly
alleged a ""probability of confusion."" /d. ; see also Paddington Corp. v. Attiki Imps. & Distribs., Inc. 996 F.2d 577 , 584 (2d
Cir. 1993).

Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiffs’ mark is registered and entitled to protection. Instead, Defendant argues that its
use of Plaintiffs' mark was unlikely to cause consumer confusion.

1. Strength of Trademark

""A mark's strength is a function of its distinctiveness, whether inherent or whether acquired in the marketplace."" Classic
Liquor Importers, Ltd. v. Spirits Int'l B.V. , 201 F. Supp. 3d 428, 442 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). Because Defendant concedes that the
Emmy Statuette is a strong trademark, Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 16, the first factor weighs in favor of the Television
Academies. See Hormel Foods Corp. v. Jim Henson Prods., Inc. . 73 F.3d 497 , 503 (2d Cir. 1996) (""[A]n undeniably strong
mark [is] a factor favoring the trademark plaintiff."").

2. Similarity of the Marks

""In applying this factor, courts consider whether the similarity of the marks is likely to cause confusion among potential
customers."" Arrow Fastener Co. v. Stanley Works , 59 F.3d 384 , 394 (2d Cir. 1995). ""The more unusual and distinctive the
design of a trademark logo, the greater the likelihood that such an astonishing degree of similarity will evoke an assumption
that the senior and junior user are affiliated."" Guthrie Healthcare Sys.__826 F.3d at 38 .

As noted supra , the Emmy Statuette and the Crony Graphic are nearly identical; the Crony Graphic depicts the same
winged figure holding a globe-shaped object in the same dimensions, proportions, and colors as the Emmy Statuette.
Indeed, Defendant admits to using ""the entire"" Emmy Statuette in the Crony Graphic. Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 12. As
such, the second factor favors the Plaintiffs.

[551 F.Supp.3d 428]

3. Proximity and Competitiveness of Products

""The proximity inquiry asks to what extent the two products compete with each other."" Brennan's, Inc. v. Brennan's Rest.



--- Page 7 ---
L.L.C. , 360 F.3d 125 , 134 (2d Cir. 2004). The purpose of the inquiry, which considers both market proximity and
geographic proximity, is ""to determine whether the two products have an overlapping client base that creates a potential for

confusion."" /d. In considering commercial proximity, courts also consider how ""the respective products are marketed"" and
made available to consumers. Star Indus., Inc.__412 F.3d at 387 .

Here, the parties are engaged in distinct commercial activities. The Television Academies present the Emmy Awards while
Defendant produces and disseminates ""political and social commentary"" on YouTube and other social media platforms.
Nonetheless, Defendant also hosts and promotes at least one award show; as noted supra, the title of Defendant's Video
explicitly references its ""Crony Awards."" Accordingly, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the Crony Graphic is used in a
similar way to the Emmy Statuette such that there is some potential for confusion. As such, on balance, at the motion to
dismiss stage, the third factor is neutral or weighs slightly in favor of the Plaintiffs.

4. Bridging the Gap

""Bridging the gap’ refers to the likelihood that the senior user will enter the junior user's market in the future, or that
consumers will perceive the senior user as likely to do so."" Star Indus., Inc.__412 F.3d at 387 .

Plaintiffs allege no facts to support the inference that they have any intention of entering Defendant's market or that
consumers would reasonably believe that the Television Academies would be likely to engage with Defendant's YouTube
platform. Accordingly, the fourth factor favors the Defendant.

5. Actual Confusion

""It is black letter law that actual confusion need not be shown to prevail on a trademark infringement claim, since actual
confusion is very difficult to prove."" Guthrie Healthcare Sys.__ 826 F.3d at 45 (citation omitted). Accordingly, Plaintiffs need
only show ""a likelihood of confusion.""

Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that, based on the Crony Graphic's striking similarity to the Emmy Statuette and its use in
connection with Defendant's Crony Awards, the Crony Graphic is ""likely to cause confusion, mistake, and deception as to
the source or origin of the Television Academies’ products and services"" and may ""falsely suggest a sponsorship,
connection, or association between Defendant, its products, its services, and/or its commercial activities with the Television
Academies and/or their corporate identity."" Am. Compl. {{ 48, 65, 67.

Accordingly, the fourth factor favors the Plaintiffs.
6. Bad Faith

In determining whether a defendant acted in bad faith, the Court ""considers whether the defendant adopted its mark with the
intention of capitalizing on the plaintiff's reputation and goodwill and on any confusion between his and the senior user's

product."" Savin Corp. v. Savin Grp. , 391 F.3d 439 , 460 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation and internal alterations omitted). A
presumption of bad faith may arise where a defendant intentionally copies a plaintiffs mark for its own purposes. Heritage of
Pride, Inc. v. Matinee NYC, Inc. , No. 14-CV-4165, 2014 WL 12783866, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. June 20, 2014) (citing

[551 F.Supp.3d 429]

Paddington Corp._. 996 F.2d at 586 (""Where a second-comer acts in bad faith and intentionally copies a trademark ... a
presumption arises that the copier has succeeded in causing confusion."")); see also Mobil Oil Corp. v. Pegasus Petroleum
Corp. , 818 F.2d 254 , 258 (2d Cir. 1987) (""Intentional copying gives rise to a presumption of a likelihood of confusion."").

Because Defendant does not dispute that it copied the entire Emmy Statuette to create the Crony Graphic, see Def. Mem. of
Law, Dkt. 25 at 12, the Court finds a presumption of bad faith to be appropriate here. See Paddington Corp... 996 F. 2d at
587 (""Where [actual knowledge of the prior user's mark] is accompanied by similarities so strong that it seems plain that
deliberate copying has occurred, we have upheld findings of bad faith."").

The sixth factor favors the Plaintiffs.
7. Differences in Relative Quality

Differences in relative quality between a senior and a junior user's goods or services can harm the senior user's reputation
and affect the likelihood of consumer confusion. Guthrie Healthcare Sys._, 826 F.3d at 44 . Because Plaintiffs have not
alleged what, if any, quality differences exist between the two images, the Court is unable to draw any conclusions as to the
respective quality of the products. Accordingly, this factor is neutral.

8. Consumer Sophistication

The more sophisticated the consumers of a product are, ""the less likely it is that similarities in ... trade marks will result in
confusion concerning the source or sponsorship of the product."" Paddington Corp.__996 F.2d at 587 (citation omitted).
Where potential consumers lack a sophisticated knowledge of the overall market, however, ""the likelihood is higher that
similarity of trademarks may lead them to believe that a junior user's activities are affiliated with those of the senior user.""



--- Page 8 ---
Guthrie Healthcare Sys.__ 826 F.3d at 43 .

Although Defendant claims that its audience is ""highly intelligent and sophisticated"" and would therefore not confuse the
Crony Graphic with the Emmy Statuette, Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 16, at this stage, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged
that a member of the general online public ""might see the EMMY Statuette Design as used by Defendant and mistakenly
believe that there is a link between Plaintiffs and Defendant or find the association offensive, thus tarnishing the mark."" Pls.""
Opp., Dkt. 37 at 24; see also Am. Compl. 48, 67, 69. Accordingly, the eighth factor favors Plaintiffs.

In sum, considering the eight Polaroid factors together, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged a
probability of confusion. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss the trademark infringement claims is denied.

Il. Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss the Counterclaims is Granted
A. Declaratory Judgment Claims

Counterclaimants seek a declaratory judgment that the Crony Graphic was fair use and that Mr. Goodman's commentary
about Mr. Sharp and his father was not defamatory. 43 Neither is an appropriate basis for a declaratory judgment.

""The Declaratory Judgment Act ... vests a district court with discretion

[551 F.Supp.3d 430]

to exercise jurisdiction over a declaratory action."" Duane Reade, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co__411 F.3d 384 , 389
(2d Cir. 2005) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) ). To decide whether to entertain an action for declaratory judgment, a district
court must consider ""(1) whether the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying or settling the legal issues involved;
and (2) whether a judgment would finalize the controversy and offer relief from uncertainty."" /d. A counterclaim seeking a
declaratory judgment may be dismissed if it is duplicative of the counterclaimants' affirmative defenses, does not broaden
the scope of the dispute, or would not present a live controversy once the plaintiffs' claims have been resolved on the merits.
See Arista Recs. LLC v. Usenet.com., Inc. , No. 07-CV-8822, 2008 WL 4974823, at *4—5 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2008).

Counterclaimants' request for a declaration that the Crony Graphic was fair use, Am. Answer at 43-44 4 74-83, is entirely
duplicative of Defendant's affirmative defense of fair use. See, e.g. , Arista Recs. LLC , 2008 WL 4974823, at *5 (dismissing
counterclaims seeking a declaration of non-infringement that ""serve no purpose because they mirror the issues raised in
Plaintiffs’ Complaint, constitute no affirmative cause of action, and are duplicative of [Defendant's] affirmative defenses"").
Counterclaimants' claim seeking a declaration that Mr. Goodman's commentary regarding the Sharps was non-libelous
protected speech, Am. Answer at 45 9 84-89, is similarly duplicative of Defendant's affirmative defense and mirrors
Plaintiffs’ libel claim.

Because both requests are improper, the counterclaims for declaratory judgments are dismissed. 14 See, e.g. , Gorfinkel v.
Ralf Vayntrub, Invar Consulting Ltd. , No. 11-CV-5802, 2014 WL 4175914, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, 2014) (holding that
""where a declaratory judgment claim is redundant of a primary claim raised by a party to a lawsuit, it is properly dismissed as
duplicative""); Interscope Recs. v. Kimmel , No. 307-CV-0108, 2007 WL 1756383, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. June 18, 2007) (stating that
when a counterclaim is merely a ""mirror image"" of the complaint, the counterclaim serves no purpose and may be
dismissed).

B. Anti-SLAPP Claim

New York State, like many other states, has enacted legislation designed to combat so-called Strategic Lawsuits Against
Public Participation (""SLAPP""). New York's law, commonly known as an ""anti-SLAPP"" law is ""aimed at broadening the
protection of citizens facing litigation arising from their public petition and participation."" Mable Assets, LLC v. Rachmanov ,
192 A.D.3d 998 , 146 N.Y.S.3d 147 (2d Dep't 2021).

On November 10, 2020, New York amended its existing anti-SLAPP law ""to broaden the scope of the law and provide
greater protections to defendants."" Sweigert v. Goodman , No. 18-CV-08653, 2021 WL 1578097, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 22,
2021) (citing N.Y. Civil Rights Law (""NYCRL"") §§ 70-a, 76-a ; N.Y. C.P.L.R. (""CPLR"") 3211(g), 1312(h) ). Under § 70-a of
New York's amended anti-SLAPP law, a defendant may recover ""damages, including costs and attorney's fees,"" by bringing
a special motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(g). Such a motion to dismiss ""shall be granted"" unless the plaintiff
demonstrates ""that the cause of action has a

[551 F.Supp.3d 431]

substantial basis in law or is supported by a substantial argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.""
NYCRL § 70-a (citing CPLR 3211(g) ). 15

Plaintiffs argue, inter alia , that § 70-a of New York's anti-SLAPP law is inapplicable in federal court because the law's
""substantial basis"" standard conflicts with the pleading standard articulated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). 18
The Court agrees.

Pursuant to the Erie doctrine, if a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure answers the same question as a state law, the Federal


--- Page 9 ---
Rule governs in federal court, unless the rule at issue violates the Rules Enabling Act._La Liberte v. Reid, 966 F.3d 79 , 87
(2d Cir. 2020) ; see also Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 559 U.S. 393 , 398-99, 130 S.Ct. 1431 ,
176 L.Ed.2d 311 (2010) ; Hanna v. Plumer. 380 U.S. 460 , 463-64, 85 S.Ct. 1136 , 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965) . Circuits around
the country have grappled with whether various states' anti-SLAPP laws apply in federal court. 12 The Second Circuit's
recent decision in Reid all but resolves the question presented in this case. In Reid , the Circuit considered whether the
special motion-to-strike provision of California's anti-SLAPP statute, which requires outright dismissal unless the plaintiff can
""establish[ ] a probability that he or she will prevail on the claim,"" could apply in federal court. Reid, 966 F.3d at 87 . The
Circuit held that the statute could not apply in federal court because the provision's ""probability of success"" standard

conflicts with Rules 12 and 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. /d. The Circuit explained that the statute sought to
""establish the circumstances under which a court must dismiss a plaintiff's claim before trial, a question that is already

answered (differently) by Federal Rules 12 and 56."" /d.

Applying the Second Circuit's reasoning in Reid , the Court concludes that the ""substantial basis"" standard articulated in
New York's anti-SLAPP law similarly conflicts with the standards under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12 and 56. As

noted supra , under New York's law, a motion to dismiss must be granted unless, at the pleading stage, the plaintiff can
""demonstrate ] that the cause of action

[551 F.Supp.3d 432]

has a substantial basis in law or is supported by a substantial argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing
law."" CPLR 3211(g). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12, however, a plaintiff at the pleadings stage need only allege
""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 . Put
differently, New York's anti-SLAPP law imposes a different, and higher, burden on the plaintiff at the pleading stage than the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 18 See Ginx. Inc. v. Soho All. , 720 F. Supp. 2d 342 , 366 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), as corrected
(Aug. 19, 2010) (""New York's legislature may have adopted the Anti-SLAPP law to elevate a plaintiffs burden at the pleading
stage above ‘plausibility’ ... to ‘substantial basis,’ but the United States Congress has thus far declined to follow suit.""). As
such, § 70-a is inapplicable in federal court. Reid__ 966 F.3d at 87 ; see also Abbas v. Foreign Pol'y Grp.. LLC . 783 F.3d
1328 , 1333-34 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (holding that the D.C. anti-SLAPP Act was inapplicable in federal court because it required
a plaintiff to meet a higher burden at the pre-trial stage by showing a ""likelihood of success on the merits"").

In sum, because Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12 and 56 answer the same question as New York's anti-SLAPP
provision, they ""govern ... in federal court, unless Rules 12 and 56 violate the Rules Enabling Act."" Reid__966 F.3d at 88 .
Because is undisputed that Rules 12 and 56 comply with the Rules Enabling Act, id. , § 70-a of New York's anti-SLAPP law
is inapplicable in federal court. 12 Accordingly, the counterclaim premised on New York's anti-SLAPP law must be dismissed.

C. Abuse of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (""DMCA"")

The DMCA governs the means by which copyright holders can notify online service providers that their sites are hosting or
providing access to allegedly infringing material. Hosseinzadeh v. Klein , 276 F. Supp. 3d 34, 43 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). As is
relevant here, § 512(f) of the DMCA prohibits ""any person"" from ""knowingly materially misrepresent[ing] ... that material or
activity is infringing."" 17 U.S.C. § 512(f)(1). When copyright holders request that an allegedly infringing video be removed,
they are ""not liable for misrepresentation under the DMCA if they subjectively believe the identified material infringes their
copyright, even if that belief is ultimately mistaken."" Hosseinzadeh , 276 F. Supp. 3d at 44. A copyright holder ""must have
actual knowledge that it is making a misrepresentation of fact"" to be liable under § 512(f). Cabell v. Zimmerman , No. 09-CV-
10134, 2010 WL 996007, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 12, 2010) (emphasis in original); see also Rossi v. Motion Picture Ass'n of
Am. Inc. , 391 F.3d 1000 , 1005 (9th Cir. 2004) (""[T]here must be a demonstration of some actual knowledge of
misrepresentation on the part of the copyright owner."").

Plaintiffs argue that Counterclaimants have failed to allege any facts to support an inference that the Television
[551 F.Supp.3d 433]

Academies knowingly made any misrepresentation to YouTube. The Court agrees. Counterclaimants' allegations that ""Mr.
Sharp and the Television Academies misrepresented to YouTube that Defendant's Crony Graphic was infringing,"" and that
""Mr. Sharp and the Television Academies had actual knowledge, or with reasonable diligence could have obtained
knowledge, that his complaint to YouTube had no merit,"" Am. Answer at 41 58, 48 § 106, are conclusory and insufficient to
state a claim under § 512(f). Even if Plaintiffs should have known that they were making a misrepresentation (and there are
no facts alleged in the counterclaim from which the Court could reasonably infer that), ""negligence is not the standard for
liability under section 512(f)."" Cabell, 2010 WL 996007, at *4 ; see also Rossi__391 F.3d at 1005 (""A copyright owner cannot
be liable simply because an unknowing mistake is made, even if the copyright owner acted unreasonably in making the
mistake."").

In short, Counterclaimants fail to allege any facts from which the Court can reasonably infer that the Television Academies
made a knowing and material misrepresentation as required by the DMCA. Accordingly, Counterclaimants have not stated a
claim for abuse of DMCA.

CONCLUSION


--- Page 10 ---
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's partial motion to dismiss or in the alternative for judgment on the pleadings is
DENIED. Defendant's request for an order declaring that Defendant's use of the Crony Graphic was de minimis or fair use is
also DENIED. Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss the counterclaims is GRANTED. 22 George Sweigert's motion to intervene is
DENIED.

No later than September 3, 2021 , the parties must submit a joint letter on the status of discovery.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:

1George Sweigert, with whom Jason Goodman has an on-going dispute that festers on social media, see Sweigert v. Goodman , No. 18-CV-8653
(VEC), moved to intervene in this case after Mr. Goodman suggested that Mr. Sweigert was responsible for Defendant's inability to produce some
requested discovery in this case. Tr., Dkt. 69 at 61; Dkt. 84.

Mr. Sweigert's motion to intervene, or in the alternative, to appear as amicus curiae is denied. To intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 24(a), a party must have a ""direct, substantial, and legally protectable"" interest in the subject matter of the action._United States v. City of New
York , 198 F.3d 360 , 365 (2d Cir. 1999). Mr. Sweigert has no protectable legal interest in this case, which concerns Defendant's use of the Emmy
Statuette image. See New York News, Inc. v. Kheel , 972 F.2d 482 , 486-87 (2d Cir. 1992) (denying non-party's motion to intervene to strike allegedly
false portions of plaintiffs complaint because the non-party failed to identify a ""protectable interest in the action"").

To intervene permissively under Rule 24(b), a party must have ""a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.""
Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B). Intervention, however, cannot be used to ""inject collateral issues into an existing action,"" and the Court has broad discretion
to deny an applicant's motion for permissive intervention. Kheel_, 972 F.2d at 486 —87. As noted supra , Mr. Sweigert has not identified any legally
protectable interest in this case, and the Court will not allow Mr. Sweigert to inject his unrelated ongoing disputes with Mr. Goodman into this case.

2 For purposes of this Opinion, the Court accepts well-pled, non-conclusory factual allegations in the Complaint and Counterclaims as true. The Court
also takes judicial notice of the two tweets and two videos attached as Exhibits 1-4 to Plaintiffs’ motion for judicial notice because the tweets and videos
are publicly available. See Pls.’ Motion for Judicial Notice, Dkt. 37-1 at 2-5; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Wrights Mill Holdings, LLC , 127 F. Supp. 3d 156,
166 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (courts may take judicial notice of ""information publicly announced on certain non-governmental websites""); Porrazzo v. Bumble Bee
Foods, LLC , 822 F. Supp. 2d 406 , 411 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (""[I]t is well-established that courts may take judicial notice of publicly available documents on a
motion to dismiss.""). Exhibit 2 is the video at issue in this case and can be found at https://www.bitchute.com/video/MQ2xH7Z3584/ (the ""Video""); see
Am. Compl. § 33.

In its amended answer, Defendant admits using the Crony Graphic in a second video. Am. Answer at 25 9 19-20 (citing https://youtu.be/Ey73TgziOLg).
The Court has not considered the second video for purposes of this Opinion because the video is not referenced in Plaintiffs’ amended complaint,
Plaintiffs’ motion for judicial notice, or Defendant's original answer. The Court notes, however, that its analysis or conclusions would not be altered in any
way if it also considered the second video.

3The allegedly defamatory video is currently inaccessible. Am. Compl. § 43 (citing youtube.com/watch?v=3heNmyUIZj8).

4Counterclaimants voluntarily withdrew their first, second, and sixth counterclaims for tortious interference and malicious prosecution/abuse of process.
Def. Opp., Dkt. 50 at 10.

3 At certain points in its opening brief, Defendant indicates that it is simultaneously moving for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(c). See, e.g. , Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 5. Because the ""standard for granting a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is
identical to that of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim,"" the Court's analysis would not change if considering Defendant's motion under Rule
12(c)._Patel v. Contemp. Classics of Beverly Hills . 259 F.3d 123 , 126 (2d Cir. 2001).

& Defendant's cited cases are inapposite. See Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 25 at 6-8. For example, in Gayle v. Home Box Off., Inc. , No. 17-CV-5867, 2018
WL 2059657, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 1, 2018), defendant's use was de minimis because the allegedly infringing image was ""barely visible"" and appeared ""in
the background of a single scene."" Similarly, in Gottlieb Dev. LLC v. Paramount Pictures Corp. , 590 F. Supp. 2d 625 , 632 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), defendant's
use was found to be de minimis because the allegedly infringing material was ""always in the background,” ""never appear[ed] by itself or in a close-up,""
was either “out of focus or obscured,"" and displayed only for ""a few seconds at a time.""

ZWhile Defendant claims that ""[t]he broadcast was not actually an award show,"" Defendant's Video, for which the Crony Graphic is used as the thumbnail
image, is titled ""John Cullen Presents The Crony Awards for International Excellence in Covid-19 Response."" See Am. Answer at 3-4 { 4.

8 See Video at 01:25 to 01:55, 03:15 to 03:25, 06:32 to 06:55, 08:37 to 08:44.

2New York law is similar but does not require proof that the plaintiff's mark is famous. New York's anti-dilution statute provides: ""Likelihood of injury to
business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark or trade name shall be a ground for injunctive relief ... notwithstanding the absence of
competition between the parties or the absence of confusion as to the source of goods or services."" N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 360-I.

10 Although New York law does not include an analogous ""fair use"" exception, New York's anti-dilution law is ""substantively similar"" to federal law, such
that claims under the two laws ""may be analyzed together."" Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. My Other Bag, Inc. , 156 F. Supp. 3d 425, 434 n.3 (S.D.N.Y.
2016), afd , 674 F. App'x 16 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing Tiffany (NU) Inc. v. eBay, Inc.__576 F. Supp. 2d 463 , 523 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) ).

11The Court also notes that because Defendant used the Crony Graphic to market its own ""services,"" namely the Crony Awards, Defendant's use falls
outside the fair use exception. See Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc. , 588 F.3d 97 , 112 (2d Cir. 2009) (rejecting parody exception where
defendant used ""Charbucks"" mark as a designation of source for its own line of coffee); My Other Bag, Inc. , 156 F. Supp. 3d at 437 (""Section 1125(c)(3),
by its terms, protects ‘[aJny fair use ... of a famous mark by another person other than as a designation of source for the person's own goods or services.
*"" (emphasis in original).

12 The elements necessary to prevail on a trademark infringement claim under New York law mirror the Lanham Act. OffWhite Prods., LLC v. Off-White
LLC , 480 F.Supp.3d 558, 563 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).

13 The Complaint includes a claim of libel that Defendant did not move to dismiss, opting instead to assert (with Mr. Goodman) a counterclaim for a


--- Page 11 ---
declaratory judgment that Mr. Goodman's statements were not defamatory. The strategic or tactical reason for so proceeding is a mystery.

14To the extent that Plaintiffs' claims are not resolved on the merits and Counterclaimants continue to have an interest in a ruling on the fair use or libel
issues, Counterclaimants may seek to re-plead a declaratory action counterclaim at that point.

18 A defendant in a purported SLAPP action may also bring a special motion for summary judgment pursuant to CPLR 3212(h). Such a motion ""shall be
granted unless the party responding to the motion demonstrates that the action, claim, cross claim or counterclaim has a substantial basis in fact and law
or is supported by a substantial argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law."" CPLR 3212(h).

18 Counterclaimants argue that the Court can apply New York's anti-SLAPP law because § 70-a is a substantive provision rather than a procedural one.
The Court disagrees. Counterclaimants' argument rests almost entirely on Judge Rakoff's decision in Palin v. New York Times Co. , 510 F.Supp.3d 21,
26 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). In Palin , the district court held that NYCRL § 76-a, an entirely different provision of the law than is at issue in this case, was
substantive and therefore applicable in federal court. /d. The court in Palin expressly declined to consider the applicability of § 70-a in federal court. /d. at
25 n.2 (""Defendants do not ask the Court to apply § 70-a in this action, nor do they contend that the provision would even apply in federal court."").

12 The Fifth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits have held that certain provisions of anti-SLAPP laws are inapplicable in federal court when they conflict with
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12 and 56. See Klocke v. Watson , 936 F.3d 240 , 242 (5th Cir. 2019) ;_Carbone v. Cable News Network, Inc. , 910
F.3d 1345 , 1350 (11th Cir. 2018) ; Abbas v. Foreign Policy Grp., LLC , 783 F.3d 1328 , 1335 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The First and Ninth Circuits have
concluded otherwise. See Godin v. Schencks , 629 F.3d 79 , 86-87 (1st Cir. 2010) ; United States ex rel. Newsham v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co.
190 F.3d 963 , 972 (9th Cir. 1999).

18 The law's provisions similarly conflict with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a). Rule 56(a) permits summary judgment only if ""the movant shows that
there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law;"" the anti-SLAPP law reverses the burden
and requires the plaintiff to prove ""a substantial basis in fact and law"" for the claim. CPLR 3212(h).

18 Because the Court finds that § 70-a does not apply in federal court, the Court need not consider Plaintiffs’ alternative arguments for dismissal of the
anti-SLAPP counterclaim. See Pls.’ Reply, Dkt. 53 at 2-8.

20 Leave to amend is denied because amendment would be futile._Fried/ v. City of New York , 210 F.3d 79 , 87 (2d Cir. 2000) (leave to amend may be
denied if there is ""substantial reason to do so, such as excessive delay, prejudice to the opposing party, or futility."").

OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT FOR PLAINTIFFS AND DISMISSING DEFENDANT'S
COUNTERCLAIMS

ALVIN K. HELLERSTEIN, U.S.D.J.:

Plaintiff Matthew Lombardo is the author of Who's Holiday! (the ""Play""), a comedic play that makes use of the characters,
plot, and setting of the Dr. Seuss book, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! ("" Grinch""), to make fun of it and to criticize its
qualities, i.e., to parody it. Plaintiffs Lombardo and Who's Holiday LLC seek a declaration that the Play is fair use and
therefore does not infringe upon defendant Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P.'s copyright in Grinch. Defendant asserts
counterclaims alleging copyright and trademark infringement. Plaintiffs move for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule
12(c), arguing that the Play constitutes fair use of defendant's copyright. Plaintiffs also move to dismiss defendant's
counterclaims for failure to state a legally sufficient claim for relief. For the reasons stated herein, plaintiffs’ motion is
granted. The Play constitutes fair use and therefore does not infringe defendant's copyright in Grinch or related trademarks.
Defendant's counterclaims are dismissed.

BACKGROUND
|. The Original Work: How The Grinch Stole Christmas!

Grinch , originally published in 1957, is a well-known children's book written by the author known as Dr. Seuss. First
Amended Compl. (""FAC"") § 7. Defendant owns a copyright in Grinch, and alleges ownership of trademarks in (i) the
characters of the Grinch and Cindy—Lou Who; (ii) the stylized hand-lettering used consistently throughout Dr. Seuss books;
and (iii) certain drawn images of Cindy—Lou Who. FAC { 8; Counterclaims § 20.

Grinch tells the story of the Grinch, a green creature that lives in a cave on Mount Crumpit above the town of Who-Ville,
home of the merry and cheerful Whos, who positively love Christmas. The Grinch, who despises Christmas, decides to ruin
Christmas for Who-Ville by disguising himself as Santa Claus and stealing all of Who-—Ville's Christmas trees and presents.
While executing his plan, the Grinch encounters Cindy—Lou Who, an adorable two-year old girl. When Cindy—Lou asks

[279 F.Supp.3d 503]

the Grinch why he is taking her family's tree, the Grinch lies to Cindy—Lou, telling her that he needs to repair a light on the
tree but will return it soon. Cindy—Lou believes the Grinch and returns to bed. The next day, the Grinch listens from Mount
Crumpit for the sound of crying Whos, but instead hears the sounds of merry singing. The Grinch, upon learning that the
Whos could remain joyous during Christmas even without presents or Christmas trees, realizes that Christmas means more
than presents. The Grinch, his heart having ""grown three sizes that day,"" returns to Who-Ville with all of the presents and
joins the Whos for a scrumptious feast, featuring a dish called roast beast. See generally , Greenberger Decl. Ex. 2.

Il. The Allegedly Infringing Work: Who's Holiday

Plaintiff Lombardo is the author of the play, Who's Holiday. Lombardo formed plaintiff Who's Holiday LLC to produce the
Play. Who's Holiday is a one-actress 75-minute comedic play featuring a rather down-and-out 45 year-old version of Cindy—
Lou Who. The Play takes place at Cindy—Lou's 1970s era trailer in the hills of Mount Crumpit. Cindy—Lou speaks to the
audience only in rhyming couplets that are clearly intended to evoke the work of Dr. Seuss. While waiting for guests to arrive
for her Christmas party, Cindy—Lou tells the audience the story of her life, beginning with her first encounter with the Grinch
at the age of two. Throughout the Play, as she shares her history, Cindy—Lou drinks hard alcohol, abuses prescription pills,
and smokes a substance she identifies as ""Who Hash,"" which she describes as just ""like a prescription"" which keeps her in
check to avoid a ""conniption."" She engages in this self-medication following her realization that none of the guests she
invited to her party is likely to attend, as they keep calling throughout the Play to cancel.

As Cindy—Lou recounts her initial encounter with the Grinch and his subsequent change of heart, paralleling the plot of the


--- Page 2 ---
original Grinch, she incorporates age-inappropriate language and details that do not appear in the original work. (""I watched
for a while as he was stealin our shit / Then | cooed by mistake and he saw me. That twit.""); (""How would | know he was evil
or crass? / He gave me some water. Then patted my ass.""). After recounting the plot of the original Grinch , Cindy—Lou goes
on to tell the audience—using rhymes involving bawdy, ribald innuendo—that she became friends with the Grinch during her
school-age years, and that she engaged in sexual intercourse with the Grinch upon turning eighteen. Cindy—Lou refers to
the size of the Grinch's genitalia growing ""three sizes that day."" After learning that she is pregnant, Cindy—Lou informs the
Grinch, who asks her to marry him. Over her parents' protestation (""When | told my parents they weren't pleased in the least
/ | mean, who wants their baby girl deflowered by a beast.""), Cindy—Lou marries the Grinch, moves into his cave at the top of
Mount Crumpit, and gives birth to their child (""With the fur and the paws it looked just like its Daddy / With no who dilly
attached, | named the kid Paitti."").

As the years go by, Cindy—Lou and the Grinch's relationship begins to sour as they struggle with issues such as
unemployment, access to health care, lack of heat, and hunger. One day, Cindy—Lou discovers that the family dog Max has
frozen to death, and she decides to cook his carcass in order to feed her family. When the Grinch discovers what his dinner
is made of, he attempts to physically abuse Cindy—Lou. During the ensuing scuffle, the Grinch falls off the edge of a cliff and
dies. Following the Grinch's death, Cindy—Lou is arrested, convicted and incarcerated, and her daughter is put into foster
care.

[279 F.Supp.3d 504]

After describing how her time in prison ultimately made her stronger and wiser, Cindy—Lou eventually finds out that all of her
guests have declined to attend her party and begins to cry. It then dawns on her that she can celebrate Christmas with the
audience instead. After singing a few Christmas songs, the door bells rings. Cindy—Lou expects it to be a local prankster, but
it turns out to be her daughter, Patti. See generally, FAC Ex. 1.

Ill. Procedural History

In July 2016, defendant sent plaintiffs and related entities numerous cease-and-desist letters requesting that plaintiffs refrain
from any conduct that infringed defendant's intellectual property. After receipt of these letters, plaintiffs elected not to move
forward with their planned production of the Play, and instead filed this lawsuit. In addition to seeking a declaration that the
Play constitutes fair use, plaintiffs also filed several tort claims seeking recovery of funds lost as a result of the cancelled
production. In an earlier opinion, | granted defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff's tort claims. See Lombardo v. Dr. Seuss
Enterprises, L.P. ,2017 WL 1378413 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2017). In response to plaintiffs’ first amended complaint, defendant
filed counterclaims alleging copyright and trademark infringement. Over defendant's objection that discovery was necessary
before the fair use issue could be resolved, | invited plaintiffs to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule
12(c) to test the issue. See Scheduling Order, Dkt. No. 40 (June 7, 2017).

DISCUSSION
I. The Question of Whether the Play Constitutes Fair Use Is Properly Resolved on a Rule 12(c) Motion

The parties dispute whether the question of fair use can be resolved on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiffs
argue that discovery is unnecessary because the only task for the Court is to conduct a side-by-side comparison of the Play
and Grinch and apply the law of fair use. Defendant counters that the following discovery is necessary to resolve the fair use
question: (i) all versions of the Play's website and potential advertisements (as opposed to just those attached as exhibits to
plaintiffs’ pleadings); (ii) all drafts of the Play itself; (iii) all set and costume designs; and (iv) deposition testimony from the
Play's author, director, set designer and costume designer.

No such discovery is necessary in this case. Numerous courts in this district have resolved the issue of fair use on a motion
for judgment on the pleadings by conducting a side-by-side comparison of the works at issue. In Arrow Prods., LTD. v.

Weinstein Co. LLC , 44 F.Supp.3d 359 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), for example, the court held that ""discovery would not provide any
additional relevant information in this inquiry"" because ""[alll that is necessary for the court to make a determination as to fair
use are the two films at issue."" 44 F.Supp.3d at 368. Similarly, in Adjmi v. DLT Entm't Ltd. , 97 F.Supp.3d 512 (S.D.N.Y.
2015), which concerned a play that parodied the television show Three's Company , the court addressed fair use on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings, reasoning that ""[cJourts in this Circuit have resolved motions to dismiss on fair use
grounds in this way: comparing the original work to an alleged parody, in light of applicable law."" 97 F.Supp.3d at 527 ; see
also Effie Film, LLC v. Murphy . 932 F.Supp.2d 538 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (resolving copyright infringement claim on motion for
judgment on the pleadings by comparing screenplays side-by-side);

[279 F.Supp.3d 505]

Swatch Grp. Mamt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. , 756 F.3d 73 , 86 (2d Cir. 2014) (affirming district court's pre-discovery
fair use ruling and noting that the ""discovery [plaintiff] seeks would not alter our analysis"").

Even in cases where fair use is addressed on a motion for summary judgment, following discovery, courts often resolve the
issue of fair use by comparing the two works at issue. In Cariou v. Prince . 714 F.3d 694 (2d Cir. 2013) , for example, the
Second Circuit chose to disregard the alleged infringer's deposition testimony, and instead endorsed the Seventh Circuit's
approach of resolving fair use by ""looking at the artworks and the photographs side-by-side."" 714 F.3d at 707 ; see



--- Page 3 ---
Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy Partners, 682 F.3d 687 , 690 (7th Cir. 2012) (""[T]he only two pieces of evidence needed
to decide the question of fair use in this case are the original version of WWITB and the episode at issue.""). The Second
Circuit adopted this approach because ""[w]hat is critical is how the work in question appears to the reasonable observer, not
simply what an artist might say about a particular piece or body of work."" Cariou__714 F.3d at 707 .

Thus, although discovery might yield additional information about plaintiffs’ intent, such information is unnecessary to resolve
the fair use issue; all that is needed is the parties’ pleadings, copies of Grinch and the Play, and the relevant case law.
Defendant objects that plaintiffs have cherry-picked documents (such as promotional materials) that refer to the Play as a
parody, and attached those documents to their complaint. | have not relied on such documents. The ""threshold question
when fair use is raised in defense of parody is whether a parodic character may reasonably be perceived,"" not whether the
author of the secondary work labels it as such. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc_, 510 U.S. 569 , 582, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ,
127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) .

To prevail on a Rule 12(c) motion in this context, plaintiffs' must ""establish that there can be no set of facts to support an
action for copyright infringement"" brought against them. Adjmi , 97 F.Supp.3d at 526-27. In this sense, ""[b]ecause this is an
action for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement, [plaintiffs'] burden on this motion is turned on its head."" In deciding this
motion, all pleadings—including defendant's counterclaims—are taken to be true, subject to the same plausibility standard
that applies on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See Effie Film, LLC__932 F.Supp.2d at 552 (""In deciding a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c)
motion the court applies the same standard as it would in deciding a Rule 12(b) motion—a plaintiff must plead sufficient
facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face."").

ll. Fair Use

""The ultimate goal of copyright is to expand public knowledge and understanding, which copyright seeks to achieve by giving
potential creators exclusive control over copying of their works, thus giving them a financial incentive to create informative,
intellectually enriching works for public consumption."" Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 212 (2d Cir. 2015). ""For
nearly three hundred years, since shortly after the birth of copyright in England in 1710, courts have recognized that, in
certain circumstances, giving authors absolute control over all copying from their works would tend in some circumstances
to limit, rather than expand, public knowledge."" /d. ""Courts thus developed the doctrine, eventually named fair use, which
permits unauthorized copying in some circumstances, so as to further 'copyright's very purpose, '[t]o promote the Progress
of Science and useful

[279 F.Supp.3d 506]

Arts.''"" Id. (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ) (quoting U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8).

The fair use doctrine is codified in the Copyright Act of 1976. See 17 U.S.C. § 107. ""That codification does not so much
define ‘fair use' as provide a non-exhaustive list of factors to guide courts' fair use determinations."" TCA Television Corp. v.
McCollum , 839 F.3d 168 , 178 (2d Cir. 2016). The preamble to Section 107 provides that ""the fair use of a copyrighted work
... for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use),
scholarship, or research is not an infringement of copyright."" 17 U.S.C. § 107. ""When the copied work is being used for one
of the purposes identified in the preamble, there is a strong presumption in favor of fair use[.]"" Fox News Network, LLC v.
TVEyes, Inc. , 43 F.Supp.3d 379, 389 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Institute _ 364 F.3d 471 , 477 (2d Cir.
2004) ).

Although fair use requires a ""case-by-case analysis,"" Campbell__510 U.S. at 577 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 , and ""is an open-ended
and context-sensitive inquiry,""Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 251 (2d Cir. 2006), most courts approach the issue by
applying the four nonexclusive factors set out in the Copyright Act itself: ""(1) the purpose and character of the use, including
whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the
use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107. These four factors are not to be

""treated in isolation, one from another."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Instead, ""[a]ll are to be explored, and
the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."" /d. ""A proponent of the fair use doctrine need not
establish that each factor weighs in its favor to prevail."" TVEyes , 43 F.Supp.3d at 389.

a. First Fair Use Factor: Purpose and Character of the Use

""The first factor, which addresses the manner in which the copied work is used, is the 'heart of the fair use inquiry.’ "" N.
Jersey Media Grp. Inc. v. Pirro , 74 F.Supp.3d 605, 614 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Blanch__467 F.3d at 251 ). ""The central
question is 'whether and to what extent the new work is 'transformative,''"" Estate of Smith v. Cash Money Records, Inc. ,
253 F.Supp.3d 737, 749 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ), for the ""goal of copyright ...
is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works."" Campbell 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . To resolve
whether a work is transformative, Campbell instructs courts to consider ""whether the new work merely supersedes the
objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first
with new expression, meaning, or message."" /d.



--- Page 4 ---
| begin my analysis of the first fair use factor by considering whether the Play is a parody of Grinch, for parody "" ‘has an
obvious claim to transformative value,’ and thus deciding that the new work is a parody necessarily entails finding that the
new work is transformative."" Abilene Music, Inc. v. Sony Music Entm't, Inc. . 320 F.Supp.2d 84 , 89 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (quoting
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ); see also MasterCard Int'l Inc. v. Nader 2000 Primary Comm., Inc. , 2004 WL
434404, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2004) (""One such transformative use that is typically found to be fair use is a parody."");
Adjmi , 97 F.Supp.3d at 534 (finding fair

[279 F.Supp.3d 507]

use and describing secondary work as a ""transformative parody"" of original work). Treating parodies as transformative works
is logical, for if defendant could control who was permitted to parody the Grinch and in what manner, the purpose of
copyright law would be stifled, not promoted.

For the reasons discussed below, | hold that the Play is a parody of Grinch, and thus transformative.
i. Parody

""One type of protected creativity is parody, a recognized category of criticism or comment authorized by Section 107."" Adjmi
, 97 F.Supp.3d at 530. ""Where the [alleged infringer's] use is for the purposes of ‘criticism, comment ... scholarship, or
research,’ 17 U.S.C. § 107,"" the first factor ""will normally tilt in the [alleged infringer's] favor."" NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst. , 364
F.3d 471 , 477 (2d Cir. 2004) ;see also Wright v. Warner Books. Inc. . 953 F.2d 731 , 736 (2d Cir. 1991) (""[T]here is a strong
presumption that factor one favors the [alleged infringer] if the allegedly infringing work fits the description of uses described
in section 107.""). This does not end the inquiry, however, for the Supreme Court has rejected the notion that ""any parodic
use is presumptively fair."" Campbell,510 U.S. at 581 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . ""Accordingly, parody, like any other use, has to work
its way through the relevant factors, and be judged case by case, in light of the ends of the copyright law."" /d. That said,
""once a work is determined to be a parody, the second, third, and fourth factors are unlikely to militate against a finding of
fair use."" Abilene Music__320 F.Supp.2d at 89 .

""The threshold question when fair use is raised in defense of parody is whether a parodic character may reasonably be
perceived."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 582 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Adopting dictionary definitions, the Supreme Court has referred to
parody as a ""literary or artistic work that imitates the characteristic style of an author or a work for comic effect or ridicule,"" or
a ""composition in prose or verse in which the characteristic turns of thought and phrase in an author or class of authors are
imitated in such a way as to make them appear ridiculous."" /d. at 580, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The ""heart of any parodist's claim to
quote from existing material, is the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to create a new one that, at least in
part, comments on that author's works."" /d. Thus, ""the copied work must be, at least in part, an object of the parody,
otherwise there would be no need to conjure up the original work."" Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301 , 310 (2d Cir. 1992). ""If,
on the contrary, the commentary has no critical bearing on the substance or style of the original composition, which the
alleged infringer merely uses to get attention or to avoid the drudgery in working up something fresh, the claim to fairness in
borrowing from another's work diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like the extent of its
commerciality, loom larger."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 580 , 114 S.Ct. 1164.

The key question | must therefore resolve, is whether the Play comments on Grinch by imitating and ridiculing its
characteristic style for comic effect, or, as defendant contends, merely exploits the characters, style and themes of Grinch in
order ""to avoid the drudgery in working up something fresh."" /d. Defendant argues that the Play ""does not poke fun of the
Seussian rhyming style,"" but instead usurps that style in order to sell a commercial work. Nor, according to defendant, does
the Play comment on or ridicule the characters and themes of Grinch ; it merely ""uses Grinch , Cindy—Lou, the Grinch
character, and the dog Max as building blocks for a sequential work, featuring

[279 F.Supp.3d 508]

those same characters in the Suess-created settings of Mount Crumpit and Who-Ville.""

Defendant's assessment misses the mark. The Play recontextualizes Grinch’'s easily-recognizable plot and rhyming style by
placing Cindy—Lou Who—a symbol of childhood innocence and naiveté—in outlandish, profanity-laden, adult-themed
scenarios involving topics such as poverty, teen-age pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse, prison culture, and murder. In so
doing, the Play subverts the expectations of the Seussian genre, and lampoons the Grinch by making Cindy—Lou's naiveté,
Who-Ville's endlessly-smiling, problem-free citizens, and Dr. Seuss' rhyming innocence, all appear ridiculous.

In Grinch, Cindy—Lou's childhood innocence serves as a counterpoint to the Grinch's deceitful nature and his disdain for joy
and happiness. Cindy—Lou is a ""small Who"" who was ""not more than two,"" and made a ""small sound like the coo of a dove.""
She asks the Grinch, ""Santy Claus, why, why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?"" The Grinch tells her that he is
taking the tree to his workshop to repair a broken light, and Cindy—Lou believes his lie. In the Play, by contrast, Cindy—Lou is
depicted as a grown woman. She lives alone in a poorly maintained trailer, struggles with alcohol and substance abuse, and
uses profanity freely (as long as it still rhymes). She mothered a child with the Grinch, knocked the Grinch off a cliff after he
tried to attack her, and served time in prison as a result. At one point, Cindy—Lou suggests to the audience that she used to
put razor blades in apples on Halloween to keep the children of Who-Ville away from her house.


--- Page 5 ---
The Play's version of Who-Ville likewise pokes fun of Grinch's utopic depiction of Who-Ville. In Grinch, Who-Ville is filled
with cheery citizens who love Christmas, have grand communal feasts, dream ""sweet dreams without a care,"" and sing
joyous songs together as they ""stand hand-in-hand."" No problems trouble the residents, who have been blessed with an
indomitably optimistic spirit that not even the Grinch can defeat. In the Play, by contrast, Who-Ville is plagued by problems
and real-world challenges. The Grinch struggles with unemployment. Who-Ville's criminal justice system metes out a harsh
punishment upon Cindy—Lou following the Grinch's death, from what appears to be lawful self-defense, and Cindy—Lou's
child is placed into foster care. In the Play, Who-Ville is no longer a place where people can overcome adversity by smiling
and singing together. Who-Ville is now a place where young women are impregnated by green beasts, families struggle to
put food on the table, paparazzi run rabid, and citizens get high on ""Who Hash"" to escape problems of daily life.

In creating these juxtapositions, the Play, rather than trading on the character of Cindy—Lou Who and the setting of Who—
Ville for commercial gain, turns these Seussian staples upside down and makes their saccharin qualities objects of ridicule.
Defendant argues that the Play's references to the Dr. Seuss song ""Fahoo Fores Dahoo Dores"" and Grinch's fictional ""goo-
goo-gums"" and ""foo-foo-fluffs"" are evidence of improper copying. Not so, for immediately after she refers to ""goo-goo-gums""
and ""foo-foo-fluffs,"" Cindy—Lou turns to the audience to comment, ""Whatever the fuck those were.""

The Play parodies Grinch also by recontextualizing and subverting the Seussian rhyming style. For example, during a scene
in which Cindy—Lou recounts her time in prison, her cell mate confronts her: ""STOP SPEAKING IN RHYME,"" the cell mate
says. ""But that's how all the Whos talk,"" Cindy—Lou tries to explain. The cell

[279 F.Supp.3d 509]

mate shoots back, ""You ain't no Who here! It's time you speak plain!"" The cell mate's response makes clear that rhyming is
unsuitable for the real world and invites the audience to contemplate the juxtaposition of speaking in rhyme and doing prison
time. The Play also uses the audience's familiarity with the Suessian rhyming style to imply vulgar, un-Suessian conclusions
to rhymes. Take, for example, Cindy—Lou's description of a night with the Grinch:

But things started to change when | turned eighteen.

| was becoming a woman. And he? Was still green.
The night of my birthday, he took me alone to the dock.
Where he gave me my present. His big, thick, long—
The telephone rings.

(Excuse me.)

""The heart of any parody is its evocation of the message or style of the original work in order to alter that message or style in
a way that humorously expresses the author's opinion of the original work."" Abilene Music_, 320 F.Supp.2d at 90 . The Play's
coarseness and vulgarity lampoons Grinch by highlighting the ridiculousness of the utopian society depicted in the original
work: society is not good and sweet, but coarse, vulgar and disappointing. Through clever re-arrangement of the original
material, the Play attempts to depict the realities of the modem world in which we live. The Play would not make sense
without evoking the style and message of Grinch, for there would be no object of the parody. Whether the Play's parody of
Grinch is effective, or in good taste, is irrelevant. See Campbell 510 U.S. at 569 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (""Whether ... parody is in
good taste or bad does not and should not matter to fair use.""); Yankee Pub. Inc. v. News Am. Pub. Inc. , 809 F.Supp. 267 ,
280 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (Leval, J.) (""First Amendment protections do not apply only to those who speak clearly, whose jokes
are funny, and whose parodies succeed."").

Both the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit have recognized that secondary works that poke fun at the original work's
hokeyness, blandness or seriousness can constitute parody. In Campbell , for example, the Supreme Court held that a 2
Live Crew song that copied the Roy Orbison song ""Pretty Woman"" was parody because it ""was clearly intended to ridicule
the white-bread original"" by ""substituting predictable lyrics with shocking ones ... [that] derisively demonstrat[e] how bland
and banal the Orbison song seems to them."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 582 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Similarly, in Leibovitz v.
Paramount Pictures Corp. , 137 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 1998) , the Second Circuit found that an advertisement for the movie
Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult , which featured the head of Leslie Nielsen superimposed over an iconic photograph of a
pregnant Demi Moore, qualified as parody. ""Because the smirking face of Nielsen contrasts so strikingly with the serious
expression on the face of Moore, the ad may reasonably be perceived as commenting on the seriousness, even the
pretentiousness, of the original. The contrast achieves the effect of ridicule that the Court recognized in Campbell would
serve as a sufficient ‘comment to tip the first factor in a parodist's favor."" 137 F.3d at 114 .

ii. Transformative Use

In assessing whether a secondary work is transformative, the ""critical inquiry is whether the new work uses the copyrighted
material itself for a purpose, or imbues it with a character, different from that for which it was created."" McCollum__839 F.3d
at 180 . Defendant argues that the Play is not transformative because it involves



--- Page 6 ---
[279 F.Supp.3d 510]

the same characters from Grinch , takes place in the same setting, and incorporates the plot of the original work. That may

be true, but the Play does much more than just insert the characters from Grinch into a dark, updated setting. By parodying
those characters and setting, the Play ""adds something new"" and ""alters the [original] with new expression, meaning, [and]

message."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The Play, as a parody, qualifies as a transformative work.See

Abilene Music__320 F.Supp.2d at 89 (""[D]eciding that the new work is a parody necessarily entails finding that the new work
is transformative."").

TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168 (2d Cir. 2016) , in which the Second Circuit recently rejected a fair use
claim, is distinguishable. McCollum concerned a play in which a character uses a sock puppet to perform, nearly verbatim, a
minute-long segment of the Abbott and Costello routine, Who's on First. The Second Circuit held that this use was not
transformative because there was no explanation why such ""extensive copying of a famous comedy routine was necessary""
to the purpose the use served: character development and plot advancement. /d. at 179. This unaltered use of an original
work, inserted into a new work for a purpose entirely disconnected from the original work itself, does not qualify as fair use

and is readily distinguishable from the Play's use of Grinch. Unlike in McCollum, where it was irrelevant whether the alleged
infringer used Who's on First or some other original work, the Play's use of Grinchis necessary to the purpose and meaning
of the Play; absent that use, much of the Play's comedy and commentary evaporates.

iii. Commercial Nature of the Allegedly Infringing Work

The first statutory factor also asks ""whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes."" 17
U.S.C. § 107. Although a finding that the secondary work is of a commercial nature generally weighs against a finding of fair
use, the Supreme Court has made clear that where the work is transformative—thalt is, the first factor otherwise favors a
finding of fair use—the fact that the work is also commercial is of less importance. Transformative works ""lie at the heart of
the fair use doctrine's guarantee of breathing space within the confines of copyright, and the more transformative the new
work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.""
Campbell__ 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . As the Second Circuit has held, ""Congress could not have intended a rule that
commercial uses are presumptively unfair."" Cariou., 714 F.3d at 708 ; see also Blanch_, 467 F.3d at 254 (discounting the
""secondary commercial nature of the use"" since ""the new work is substantially transformative.""). Given that the Play's use of
Grinch is transformative, it is of little significance that the use is also of a commercial nature.

b. Second Fair Use Factor: Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second fair use factor, the ""nature of the copyrighted work,"" recognizes that ""some works are closer to the core of
intended copyright protection than others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former
works are copied."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . For example, where the original work is fictional rather than
factual, a finding of fair use might be less likely, for the ""law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual
works than works of fiction or fantasy.""

[279 F.Supp.3d 511]

Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises , 471 U.S. 539 , 563, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) .

However, the ""second factor has rarely played a significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute."" Authors Guild v.
Google. Inc. , 804 F.3d at 220 . Moreover, ""the second factor ... is not heavily weighted in cases involving parodies,"" as is the
case here, ""since any work meriting parody is likely to be both well-known and creative enough to be close to the core of
intended copyright protection."" Abilene Music, 320 F.Supp.2d at 89 (internal quotation marks omitted). ""To quote the
Supreme Court, the second factor is not ‘ever likely to help much in separating the fair use sheep from the infringing goats in
a parody case, since parodies almost invariably copy publicly known, expressive works.'"" Adjmi, 97 F.Supp.3d at 532
(quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). Accordingly, although this factor favors defendant because Grinch is
a creative work, | decline to give much weight to this factor in light of the Play's parodic nature.

c. Third Fair Use Factor: Amount and Substantiality of Use

""The third statutory factor asks whether ‘the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work

as a whole ... are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.'"" McCollum_, 839 F.3d at 185 (quoting Campbell.
510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). A court is to consider ""not only 'the quantity of the materials used' but also ‘their quality

and importance.' "" McCollum__839 F.3d at 185 (quoting Campbell 510 U.S. at 587 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). ""There are no absolute
rules as to how much of a copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered a fair use,"" Authors Guild, Inc. v.
HathiTrust , 755 F.3d 87 , 98 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), for the ""extent of permissible
copying varies with the purpose and character of the use."" /d. (quoting Campbell__510 U.S. at 586 —-87, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). An
""important inquiry is whether the selection and quantity of the material taken are reasonable in relation to the purported
justification."" McCollum__839 F.3d at 185 . The Second Circuit has not been consistent in explaining whether a secondary
user may copy more than is necessary to achieve his or her objective. Compare Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 710 (2d
Cir. 2013) (""[T]he law does not require that the secondary artist may take no more than is necessary."" (citing Campbell, 510.



--- Page 7 ---
U.S. at 588 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 )), with Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust , 755 F.3d 87 , 98 (2d Cir. 2014) (""The crux of the
inquiry is whether 'no more was taken than necessary.'"" (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 589 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 )). It is clear,
however, that ""the larger volume (or the greater importance) of the original taken, the less likely the taking will qualify as a
air use."" Adjmi , 97 F.Supp.3d at 533.

Courts have recognized that in the context of parody, a secondary user is entitled to more extensive use of the original than
might otherwise be permissible, given that ""the parody must be able to ‘conjure up' at least enough of that original to make
he object of its critical wit recognizable."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 588 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citation omitted). Thus, the ""Court of
Appeals has consistently held that a parody under the fair use doctrine is entitled to more extensive use of the original work
han is ordinarily allowed under the substantial similarity test."" Adjmi , 97 F.Supp.3d at 533 (citing Rogers v. Koons , 960
F.2d 301 , 310 (2d Cir. 1992) ).

Applied here, the Play's use of Grinch is not excessive in relation to the parodic purpose of the copying. The Play does
incorporate substantial elements of

[279 F.Supp.3d 512]

Grinch's characters, setting, plot, and style but, as plaintiffs have articulated, the Play engages in this ""distorted imitation"" in
order to mock the original. In the Play, the character of Cindy—Lou serves an entirely different function than in the original.
The Grinch, although referred to throughout the Play, does not appear as an on-stage character at all. With respect to
setting, the Play takes place in a ""silver bullet trailer in the snowy hills of Mount Crumpit,"" a specific setting absent from the
original Grinch. And, as discussed above, the Who-Ville described in the Play is considerably different from the Who-Ville
depicted in Grinch. Nor does the Play copy or quote any language from Grinch verbatim. The Play does recount the plot of
Grinch , but does so for the purpose of ""conjuring up"" the original.

For these reasons, | find that the amount taken from Grinch was ""reasonable in proportion to the needs of the intended
transformative use."" Estate of Smith , 253 F.Supp.3d at 751.

d. Fourth Fair Use Factor: The Effect On the Potential Market For the Copyrighted Work

The fourth factor considers ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work,"" 17 U.S.C. §
107, and focuses on ""whether the secondary use usurps demand for the protected work by serving as a market substitute.""
McCollum__839 F.3d at 186 . ""The enquiry must take account not only of harm to the original but also of harm to the market
or derivative works."" Campbell,510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The
question is ""whether the copy brings to the marketplace a competing substitute for the original, or its derivative, so as to
deprive the rights holder of significant revenues because of the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the
copy in preference to the original."" Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d at 223 .

Beyond market substitution of the original work, analysis of the fourth factor also ""properly identifies and weighs relevant
harm to the derivative market for a copyrighted work, which market includes uses that creators of original works might

license others to develop."" McCollum__839 F.3d at 186 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although ""a court's
ocus is not on possible lost licensing fees from defendants’ challenged use,"" a court ""properly considers the challenged

use's ‘impact on potential licensing revenues for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets.’ "" /d. (quoting Am.
Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc. , 60 F.3d 913 , 930 (2d Cir. 1994) ).

Here, there is virtually no possibility that consumers will go see the Play in lieu of reading Grinch or watching an authorized
derivative work, such as the 2000 film Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Grinch is a children's book intended for
an all-ages audience, whereas the Play is a bawdy, off-color parody of Grinch that is clearly intended for adult audiences.
""As to parody pure and simple, it is unlikely that the work will act as a substitute for the original, since the two works usually
serve different market functions."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 570 —71, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The Play is not an unauthorized sequel
of Grinch , and given the clear differences in tone and content, it is unreasonable to assume that audiences might confuse
the Play for a theatrical version of Grinch, or that the Play would usurp the market for Grinch.

In Mattel, Inc. v. Pitt 229 F.Supp.2d 315 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) , for example, the court found that a website featuring images of
Barbie dolls wearing sadomasochistic

[279 F.Supp.3d 513]

costumes and engaging in sexually explicit acts would not ""pose any danger of usurping demand for Barbie dolls in the
children's toys market"" because the ""sale or display of ‘adult’ dolls does not appear to be a use Mattel would likely develop or
license others to develop."" 229 F.Supp.2d at 318 ; see also CCA & B, LLC v. F + W Media Inc.__819 F.Supp.2d 1310 , 1323
(N.D. Ga. 2011) (finding fair use in part because ""it is highly unlikely that consumers will choose an inappropriate-for-children
parody in lieu of the wholesome"" original work). It is true, as defendant argues, that some fans of Grinch may be drawn to
the Play because of its content. However, given the Play's clear parodic qualities, it is far more likely that this potential
crossover will increase interest in Grinch , as opposed to usurp the market for it. Conversely, to the extent the Play causes
fans of Dr. Seuss to abandon the original work altogether, such a concern is irrelevant, for the court's ""concern is not


--- Page 8 ---
whether the secondary use suppresses or even destroys the market for the original work or its potential derivatives, but
whether the secondary use usurps the market of the original work."" NX/VM Corp. , 364 F.3d at 482 .

Nor is it likely that the Play will have any impact on potential licensing opportunities for derivative works in defendant's
""traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets,"" McCollum _, 839 F.3d at 186 (citation omitted), for the ""market for
potential derivative uses includes only those that creators of original works would in general develop or license others to
develop."" Campbell 510 U.S. at 592 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Defendant alleges that the Play will cause harm to its licensing
market for derivative works and that it has previously authorized a number of Grinch derivative works that expanded on the
character of Cindy—Lou Who and included ""themes and jokes aimed at adult audiences."" Counterclaims §§ 18, 33. But even
accepting these allegations as true, as | must on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, defendant makes no allegations
that it intends to authorize a parody containing references to bestiality, drug use, and other distinctly ""un-Seussian"" topics.
See Campbell__510 U.S. at 592 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (""[T]he unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical
reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market."").

Thus, the fourth factor weighs strongly in favor of a finding of fair use, and in considering all of the four factors together, |
hold that the Play constitutes fair use.

Ill. Counterclaims

In addition to copyright infringement claims, which are dismissed in light of my fair use finding, defendant also asserts three
claims sounding in trademark: (i) false association and unfair competition in violation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15
U.S.C. § 1125(a) ; (ii) unfair competition under New York common law; and (iii) trademark dilution under New York General
Business Law Section 360-L. N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 360-1. As relevant to this litigation, defendant alleges trademarks in (i)
the characters of the Grinch and Cindy—Lou Who; (ii) the stylized hand-lettering used consistently throughout Dr. Seuss
books; and (iii) certain drawn images of Cindy—Lou Who. Counterclaims § 20.

Conflict between the First Amendment and the law of trademark ""is inevitable in the context of parody, because the

keystone of parody is imitation.""_Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Pub. Grp.. Inc. , 886 F.2d 490 , 494 (2d Cir.
1989). In this Circuit, courts are to apply a balancing test to resolve the conflict

[279 F.Supp.3d 514]

between these interests: the Lanham Act ""should be construed to apply to artistic works only where the public interest in
avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression."" Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994 , 999 (2d
Cir. 1989). In Cliffs Notes , the Second Circuit elaborated on the Rogers balancing test in the context of parody, noting that
the test ""allows greater latitude for works such as parodies, in which expression, and not commercial exploitation of
another's trademark, is the primary intent, and in which there is a need to evoke the original work being parodied."" 866 F.2d
at 495 . ""Thus, where the unauthorized use of a trademark is for expressive purposes of comedy, parody, allusion, criticism,
news reporting, and commentary, the law requires a balancing of the rights of the trademark owner against the interests of
free speech."" Yankee Pub. Inc. v. News Am. Pub. Inc. , 809 F.Supp. 267 , 276 (S.D.N.Y. 1992).

With respect to plaintiffs’ use of the characters of the Grinch and Cindy—Lou Who, which are integral to the Play, | hold that
the public interest in free expression clearly outweighs any interest in avoiding consumer confusion, the likelihood of which is
extremely minimal given the parodic nature of the Play. See Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. My Other Bag, Inc. , 156
F.Supp.3d 425, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (hand bag that was an ""obvious parody"" of the original Louis Vuitton luxury bag
presented no likelihood of confusion).

Plaintiffs’ alleged use of Dr. Seuss-style hand-lettering and the drawn images of Cindy—Lou Who presents a closer question,
for these trademarks do not appear in the Play, but are instead alleged to have been used in connection with advertising for
the Play and other promotional materials. Counterclaims § 29. Nevertheless, they serve plaintiffs' parodic purpose, for as
the Second Circuit recognized in Cliffs Notes , a parodic work must necessarily evoke elements of the original work,
including trademarked elements, in order to communicate the object of the parody. ""It is hard to imagine, for example, a
successful parody of Time magazine that did not reproduce Time's trademarked red border."" Cliffs Notes_, 886 F.2d at 494 .
So too here, it is hard to imagine a parody of a Dr. Seuss book that did not deploy the characteristic typeface associated
with Dr. Seuss' most well-known books, or a parody of Cindy—Lou Who that omitted images of that character. The public's
interest in free speech outweighs defendant's interest in protecting these trademarks.

Normally, the strength of defendant's marks would point to a likelihood of confusion. However, ""[w]here the plaintiffs mark is
being used as part of a jest or commentary, the opposite can be true."" Yankee Pub. Inc._._809 F.Supp. at 273 . This is
because the ""strength and recognizability of the mark may make it easier for the audience to realize that the use is a parody
and a joke on the qualities embodied in trademarked word or image.""_Tommy Hilfiger Licensing. Inc. v. Nature Labs, LLC
221 F.Supp.2d 410 , 416 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, ""taking into account that
somewhat more risk of confusion is to be tolerated when a trademark holder seeks to enjoin artistic expression such as a
parody,"" | hold that the risk of confusion in this context ""does not outweigh the well-established public interest in parody.""
Cliffs Notes. 886 F.2d at 495 .1

[279 F.Supp.3d 515]


--- Page 9 ---
Defendant's state law unfair competition and trademark dilution claims are dismissed for the same reasons. See Kregos v.
Associated Press , 795 F.Supp. 1325 , 1336 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (""[T]he standards for § 43(a) claims under the Lanham Act and
unfair competition claims under New York law are virtually the same."");_Charles Atlas, Ltd. v. DC Comics, Inc. 112
F.Supp.2d 330 , 341 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (finding risk of confusion ""clearly outweighed by the public interest in parodic
expression"" and dismissing state law trademark dilution and unfair competition claims ""because they are based on the same
permissible conduct.""); Yankee Publishing. 809 F.Supp. at 282 (finding that the ""same First Amendment considerations that
limit a cause of action under the Lanham Act apply also to a cause of action under New York law."").

CONCLUSION

For these reasons, plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissal of defendant's counterclaims is granted.
The Clerk shall terminate the motion, and all related motions (Dkt. Nos. 44, 48). The Play constitutes fair use and does not
infringe defendant's copyright in Grinch. The Clerk shall enter judgment granting judgment to plaintiffs and dismissing the
counterclaims, and shall tax costs in favor of plaintiffs. The Clerk shall mark the case closed.

SO ORDERED.
Notes:

1In light of this holding, | need not work through the ""likelihood of confusion"" factors established in Polaroid v. Polarad Elecs. Corp , 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir.

1961) . As articulated in Cliffs Notes , ""the Polaroid test is at best awkward in the context of parody, which must evoke the original and constitutes artistic
expression."" 886 F.2d at 497 n.3

ORDER
AMY TOTENBERG, District Judge.

The motion now before the Court calls to mind the old adage, “You can't judge a book by its cover.” This time-worn
advice instructs us to give more attention to the substance of a work than its shiny packaging. However, the Court's ruling
on the instant motion turns on whether in the madness of holiday shopping it is likely that the average consumer of Plaintiff's
book, possibly giddy from gingerbread lattes and twenty-four-hour canned holiday jingles, will be confused by the similarity
of the book covers of The Elf on the Shelfand Defendant's purported parody, The Elf off the Shelf. Because Plaintiff has not
met its burden of showing a substantial likelinood of such consumer confusion or successfully refuted Defendant's fair use
defense to copyright infringement, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction [Doc. 2].

|. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

On June 24, 2011, Plaintiff CCA and B, LLC (“CCA and B” or “Plaintiff’) filed its complaint in this action, along with a
Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction [Doc. 2]. Plaintiff seeks an Order enjoining Defendant F +
W Media, Inc. (“F + W Media” or “Defendant”) ‘from publishing, producing, marketing and selling Defendant's publication,
The Elf off the Shelf, until a trial on the merits of Plaintiff's claims has been conducted. The complaint presents claims for
ederal trademark infringement, copyright infringement, trademark dilution, and violation of the Anti-Cyber Squatting
Consumer Protection Act; state unfair competition, deceptive trade practices, and false advertising; and common law
rademark infringement and unfair competition. In its brief and oral argument supporting its motion for preliminary injunction,
Plaintiff argued that it had a substantial likelihood of success on only the trademark and copyright infringement claims. (PI.'s
Br. Supp. Mot.) This order therefore considers only those claims.

The Court held a hearing on the motion on August 24, 2011. The parties put on no witnesses at the hearing; the only
evidence admitted was a packet of website screen shots. Plaintiff notably failed to put forth evidence of consumer confusion
about the two products or irreparable harm beyond the exhibits attached to the parties' briefs. The Court therefore decides
he instant motion based on consideration of all relevant pleadings and papers filed by the parties, the web screen shots
admitted at the hearing, the original publications of both books, and oral argument.

Il. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff's publication The Elf on the Shelf (“Elf On”) is a popular children's
[819 F.Supp.2d 1316]

Christmas book sold in a 10? by 10? by 2.5? box set with a plush toy elf doll 8.5 inches in height in a red costume. 2 Since
Elf Onhit the shelves in 2005, Plaintiff claims it has sold more than 1.5 million copies. (PI.'s Br. Supp. Mot. at 2.) Plaintiff
owns registered copyrights in the elf doll and an image of an elf in a red Santa-like costume sitting on the shelf (the “sitting
elf’ image), which graces the cover. (Compl. Exs. B, C.) Plaintiff owns registered trademarks in the word mark “The Elf on
the Shelf,” the stylized logo used on the cover of its book, and the sitting elf image. (Compl. Exs. D, E, F.) Plaintiff also
currently uses the domain name www. elfontheshelf. com to promote its book.

The story in Elf On explains how Santa keeps track of who's naughty and nice each year and what are their wishes: by
employing millions of “scout” elves around the world to monitor children's behavior. (Compl. Ex. A.) These friendly elves are
dispatched to individual families to watch the children's behavior and report nightly back to Santa. ( /d. ) The story warns
children that the elf will report every “push or a shove” or broken rule, but reassures that “small acts of kindness will not be a
loss.” ( Id. ) The elf encourages children to tell him their every gift desire so he can report their lists to Santa. (d. )

Parents who wish to bring the story to life can participate by moving the elf around the house for children to find each
day as evidence that the elf returns to the North Pole at night to tell Santa about their behavior. ( See id. ) The book jacket

informs readers the author discovered an “unwitting” benefit of this “tradition”: “it helped the children to better control
themselves. All it took was a gentle reminder that ‘the elf is watching,’ for errant behavior to be modified.” ( Elf On. )


--- Page 2 ---
The book is illustrated with subdued watercolor paintings that resemble the world of a child's imagination more than that
of reality. (Compl. Ex. A.) The cover includes the stylized logo of the word mark and the sitting elf logo mark, along with the
subtitle “A Christmas Tradition” and a byline identifying the authors and illustrator. ( /d. at 1.) The book and doll set is
available at major book retailers including Amazon.com. (PI.'s Br. Supp. Mot. at 7.)

Early in 2011, Plaintiff got wind of Defendant's publication, The Elf Off the Shelf (“Elf Off’). (Pl.'s Br. Supp. Mot. at 5.)
Plaintiff claims Defendant's work infringes on its copyrights and trademarks. ( /d. ) Defendant argues that E/f Offis a non-
infringing parody of Plaintiffs book. (Defs.' Mem. Opp'n Mot.)

Elf Offtells a very different but related story. The elf narrator describes himself as a discount elf (sprung from a
marked-down copy of E/f On) who is supposed to help Santa decide who's been naughty and nice. (Compl. Ex. H.) But the
stories quickly diverge from this common ground. In Elf Off, the elf warns that he'll be “pissed” if children give him a name he
dislikes. ( /d. at 6.) Once he's given a lousy first name, Horace the Elf decides he's not going to be a good elf. Rather, he's
going to drink spiked eggnog, try to make his “move” on Barbie while Ken's away at the Malibu dream house, watch
pornography in the middle of the night, change the children's gift list so there's “something in it for me,” and finally, run away
to the tropics rather than return to the North Pole. ( /d. )

The book jacket tells readers Horace decided to accept the “shelf gig” because it was a chance to leave his parents’
basement

[819 F.Supp.2d 1317]

for the first time in two hundred and sixty seven years. Prior to “being sent out to spy on and judge small children, he worked
the assembly line in Santa's Workshop.” ( /d. )

Defendant's book cover includes the book title in a font that is quite similar to Plaintiff's stylized logo font, an image of
an elf in a green costume dangling from a shelf, the subtitle “A Christmas Tradition Gone Bad,” a byline attributing the story
to Horace the Elf, and a final sentence, in red font: “A new holiday parody —for Mom and Dad!” 3( /d.; emphasis in original.)
The book is also 10? by 10? by .25?—much thinner than Plaintiffs box set. ( /d. ) E/f Offis not sold with a doll or special
packaging. ( /d. ) The back cover shows a photograph of the elf doll holding theE/f On book while surrounded by a remote
control, Zombie Slayer DVD, and various gift cards. ( /d. ) The back cover includes a small-print disclaimer that the book is a
parody and was not “prepared, approved, or authorized” by the makers of Elf On. The copyright page includes a similar
disclaimer of association with Elf On. ( Id. )

Defendant illustrated its book with photographs of Plaintiff's elf doll, but ina green rather than red costume. ( /d. )
Photographs show the elf splayed on a table with spilled eggnog, snuggled in bed with Barbie, hanging out in the Christmas
tree with a nutcracker, and lying behind a toilet after being tormented by the cat. (Compl. Ex. H.) The first page of the Elf Off
story shows a small picture of Plaintiff's book, including the sitting elf image, partially obscured by “75% off” and “super
markdown” stickers. ( /d. )

Defendant has listed its book for pre-sale with major online retailers including both Barnes and Noble and Amazon.com.
It has also created a website promoting the book at www. elfofftheshelf. com. F + W Media projects more than $167,000 in
profits from sales of its book. (Defs.' Mem. Opp'n Mot. Ex. B at 2.)

In its brief, Plaintiff argued that Defendant's book attacks and undermines E/f On's “wholesome and healthy” image and
seeks merely to capitalize on the brand recognition E/f On commands among likely consumers. (PI.'s Br. Supp. Mot. at 6.)
Plaintiff cited an article in Publisher's Weekly that reported that E/f Offis intended to “knock a holiday favorite off its perch.” (
Id. ) Defendant agrees that is precisely their goal, but says there is nothing naughty about it. (Defs.' Mem. Opp'n Mot. at 3.)
At oral argument, Plaintiff primarily argued that Defendant's book is not in fact a parody and therefore Defendant's use of
Plaintiff's properties is actionable copyright and trademark infringement.

Plaintiff put on no witnesses at the hearing, relying entirely on the books' covers to support its argument that Elf Off
infringes its copyrights and creates a likelihood of consumer confusion. Defendant contends its work is a parody and
therefore protected by the fair use safe harbor in copyright law and not likely to confuse as required for proof of trademark
infringement.

Ill. DISCUSSION A. Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction

Before a court will grant a motion for a preliminary injunction, the moving party must establish that: (1) “it has a
substantial likelinood of success on the merits,” (2) it will suffer irreparable injury if the relief is not granted, (3) the
threatened injury outweighs the harm the relief may inflict on the non-moving party, and (4) entry of relief “would not be
adverse to the public interest.” KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, 458 F.3d 1261 , 1268 (11th Cir.2006). The plaintiff's
likelihood of success on the merits is the most important of the four factors because if plaintiff is unable to make such a
showing, the other requirements need not be considered. Bloedorn v. Grube, 631 F.3d 1218 , 1229 (11th Cir.2011) (citing
Pittman v. Cole, 267 F.3d 1269 , 1292 (11th Cir.2001)).

The Court is only authorized to grant the extreme relief of a preliminary injunction when the high standards for such
relief have been met. See Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163 , 1176 (11th Cir.2000) (“[a] preliminary injunction is an
extraordinary and drastic remedy not to be granted unless the movant clearly established the ‘burden of persuasion’ as to
each of the four prerequisites.”) (citations omitted). Furthermore, the Court must exercise caution when asked to enjoin a
publication where the defendant presents a “colorable fair use defense.” Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 268 F.3d
1257 , 1265 (11th Cir.2001) (citing Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 578 n. 10,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127
L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ).

B. Analysis of Likelihood of Success on the Merits 1. Is Elf off the Shelfa Parody?

Because the parties dispute whether Defendant's work is a parody, the first question for the Court to address is whether
the work is a parody under copyright and trademark standards. The inquiries are similar, but not identical. In copyright, the
Court must answer whether the allegedly infringing use makes some form of comment or critique of the original. In
trademark, the Court considers whether the defendant's use of the trademark is clearly in jest and therefore is less likely to
cause consumer confusion. In both areas, how the Court resolves the question affects the infringement analysis.

a. Copyright Parody Issues

Parody is a legally recognized and sanctioned form of “fair use” of an original copyrighted work. Campbell,_510 U.S. at
579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . A work is a parody for purposes of copyright analysis “if its aim is to comment upon or criticize a prior
work by appropriating elements of the original in creating a new artistic, as opposed to scholarly or journalistic, work.”
Suntrust,_268 F.3d at 1268 —69. In creating a parody, the parodies inevitably borrows portions of the copyrighted work in
order to evoke the work for purposes of comment or critique. Campbell,510 U.S. at 580 -81, 114 S.Ct. 1164 .

Following this standard, this Court concludes the parody in Elf Offis clear, albeit not particularly pungent. The question
is simply whether a parody may reasonably be perceived in the content. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 582 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Elf Off
borrows Elf On's elf-spy idea to tell the story of a very naughty elf with little interest in monitoring children's behavior. (Compl.
Ex. G at 12.) Elf Offmay not render a scathing critique of Plaintiff's book, but by reporting his own mischief throughout the
story, Horace highlights the perceived absurdity of a “big brother” type of elf reporting on small children in E/f On. The odd
realism in Elf Off (with images, including the unflattering photograph

[819 F.Supp.2d 1319]

of the elf doll lying next to a toilet, suggestive of an under-employed adult living with his parents) contrasts with the
wonderland world of E/f Onin a way that makes the idea of using an Elf “scout” (or spy) to encourage good behavior in
one's children seem somehow unsavory. Horace is not hilarious, but he does use his foul mouth to say something pointedly
different than the elf in Plaintiff's work.

Plaintiff has not, however, challenged Defendant's entire book as a copyright infringement of the story in Elf On. The
copyright claims instead charge Defendant with infringement of the elf doll and sitting elf image copyrights, which are merely
components of Plaintiff's work. This distinction is relevant in the overall copyright infringement analysis, but does not alter
the Court's finding that Defendant's use of Plaintiff's copyrighted elements is in the context of a parody.

The Court must discern whether E/f Offmanifests any comment or criticism upon the copyrighted work in the allegedly
infringing use. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 583 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . While the images and story of E/f Off may hardly rise to the
level of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, 4they nevertheless clearly constitute parody.

b. Trademark Parody Issues

For the purposes of trademark analysis, “a parody is defined as a simple form of entertainment conveyed by


--- Page 4 ---
juxtaposing the irreverent representation of the trademark with the idealized image created by the mark's owner.” People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney (“PETA”), 263 F.3d 359 , 366 (4th Cir.2001). To be considered successful, the
alleged parody must both call to mind and differentiate itself from the original, and it must “communicate some articulable
element of satire, ridicule, joking or amusement.” Smith v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,537 F.Supp.2d 1302 , 1316 (N.D.Ga.2008)
(finding that multiple uses of Wal-Mart trademarks for parody did not infringe the trademarks when they presented an
obvious critical commentary). The Court's analysis of trademark infringement factors shifts when considering a parody.

Defendant appears to have made distinctions between the marks on Plaintiff's work and its own that are most clear
upon a side-by-side comparison of the book covers, although this may not be how consumers are likely to view the
products. Defendant used a nearly identical font and design to create a cover so similar to Plaintiff's that the consumer may
not immediately identify Defendant's as a parody. The image of the elf dangling off the shelf rather than sitting on itis a
subtle alteration of the image of the elf sitting on the shelf on Plaintiff's book cover. The boldface use of “off” rather than “on”
in the title of Elf Offis somewhat more noticeable, but still a modest alteration of Plaintiff's overall cover. The use of green,
mustard, and blue colors in the main titles on the cover of the E/f Offas opposed to the red, orange, and blue colors used by
Plaintiff is a very minor distinguishing feature. However, other sub-titles on the book cover, e.g. “a new holiday parody—for
Mom and Dad,” clearly provide additional cues that distinguish the marks on the cover of Elf Offfrom Elf On.

Plaintiff urges the court to limit its analysis of the existence and effect of the parody in Defendant's work to a review of
only the cover of each book and to the domain names alone, citing as authority a case in which the infringer used a domain
name identical to the trademark—www. peta. org—for the proposition that the parody

819 F.Supp.2d 1320]

must be immediately recognizable. PETA, 263 F.3d at 367 .

However, the Fourth Circuit subsequently expanded and distinguished PETA 's holding in a case that more closely
matches the facts at issue here, Lamparello v. Falwell, 420 F.3d 309 (4th Cir.2005) . In that case, the defendant used a
strikingly similar domain name, www. fallwell. com, to criticize the views held by Jerry Falwell, who claimed common law
trademark ownership of Falwell and presented his views on www. falwell. com. The Fourth Circuit clarified in Lamparello that
PETA should notbe interpreted as suggesting that courts should analyze an allegedly infringing title without any reference to
context. /d. at 316. Rather, courts should consider an “allegedly infringing domain name in conjunction with the content of
the website identified by the domain name.” /d.

Similarly, another court in this district has found in a persuasive, detailed decision that consumers are able to interpret
meaning from context in order to distinguish a parody from the original. Smith, 537 F.Supp.2d at 1328 . An allegedly
infringing parody should be considered in context. Defendant's use of Plaintiffs marks must be considered in relation to both
the contents and cover of the book in deciding whether Defendant has created a parody.

Acknowledging the similarities between the two covers, the Court finds this question is very close for trademark
purposes. Nonetheless, Defendant has included a statement on its book cover that it is a parody, with a boldface emphasis
on “parody,” a disclaimer on the back and the inside pages, a sub-title indicating that the book is for “Mom and Dad,” and
multiple other visual cues that E/f Offdoes not purport to be Plaintiff's book ( see supra Section II). The overall impact,
though somewhat subtle, is to present enough visual information to flag for consumers that the book is a parody for adults. ©
Defendant's website, www. elfofftheshelf. com (as opposed to Plaintiff's website, www. elfontheshelf. com), presents the
book cover immediately on arrival at the site and thus similarly communicates that the book and website parody the original.

2. Copyright Infringement: Fair Use Analysis

The Court now considers whether Plaintiff has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its copyright claims
to warrant the entry of a preliminary injunction. Plaintiff argues that Defendant has unlawfully appropriated the copyrighted
images of the elf doll and the elf sitting on the shelf.

The first step in evaluating Plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits is to assess whether Plaintiff has established
the prima facie elements of a copyright infringement claim: the plaintiff owns a valid copyright and the defendant copied
original elements of the plaintiff's work. Suntrust,_268 F.3d at 1266 . The parties do not dispute these elements. Rather, they
dispute whether Defendant's copying

[819 F.Supp.2d 1321]
of some elements of Plaintiff's copyrighted works constitutes actionable infringement or protected fair use.

Four factors should be considered in analyzing a parody defense to a claim of copyright infringement under the fair use
doctrine codified in the Copyright Act: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount
and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the market or value of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107.

Having found Elf Offto be a parody, the Court next considers the fair use factors.

a. Purpose and Character of the Work


--- Page 5 ---
The first fair use factor involves two elements, the commercial or nonprofit nature of the work and the extent to which
the work makes a “transformative” use of the original. Suntrust,_268 F.3d at 1269 .

Elf Offclearly serves a commercial purpose, as Defendant's goal in creating the book is to make a profit. However, the
commerciality of the purpose falls within a normal book publication spectrum. By contrast, “[t]he use, for example, of a
copyrighted work to advertise a product, even in a parody, will be entitled to less indulgence under the first factor of the fair
use inquiry than the sale of a parody for its own sake ...” Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 585, 114 S.Ct.
1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) . In other words, when the parody itself is the product being sold, the use is less commercial
in nature than if the parody was simply part of the advertisement for a different consumer product. Here, Defendant's parodic
use of the copyrighted elements is strictly “for its own sake,” and thus the commercial nature weighs only somewhat against
a finding of fair use.

Further, the commercial nature may be mitigated by a “transformative” use of the copyrighted work, the second
element of this factor. § /d. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . To determine whether a use is transformative, “[t]he inquiry is ‘whether
the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose
or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.’ ” Suntrust,_268 F.3d at 1269 .

In Suntrust, the Eleventh Circuit found a critical parody of Gone With the Wind (GWTW) to be a transformative use. /d.
“It is principally and purposefully a critical statement that seeks to rebut and destroy the perspective, judgments, and
mythology of GWTW.” Suntrust,_268 F.3d at 1270 . In making war against the original, The Wind Done Gone (TWDG)
ultimately “demystif[ied]” and “strip[ped] the romanticism” from the original. /d. at 1270. In TWDG, the characters (all
inversions of characters in GWTW) became the vehicle for a parody, contradicting the racist assumptions enshrined in the
original book.

Elf Offclearly makes transformative use of the copyrighted elf doll. Plaintiff's only use of the copyrighted elf doll is as a
free-standing doll, which parents can move around the house to create the impression

[819 F.Supp.2d 1322]

that it has a magical life of its own. Defendant depicts the doll in rather unromantic settings that similarly demystify the
magical idea of the elf doll in E/f On. The elf doll in Elf Offis the vehicle for the parody.

Defendant used an image almost identical to Plaintiff's sitting elf image in two photographs of what looks like but is not
Plaintiffs book. (Compl. Ex. H at 5.) This use furthers Defendant's attack on Plaintiff's work by showing the book covered
with clearance stickers and next to a Zombie Slayer DVD on the back cover of Defendant's book.

Defendant also used an inverted variation of the sitting elf image on the cover, an elf dangling from a shelf. However,
that image includes a more realistic depiction of the elf doll than the sitting elf image. Because it does not do much to
advance Defendant's story or convey commentary, the dangling elf use does not appear to be as transformative as the
photos of the elf doll or the defaced images of Plaintiff's book. However, because it does transform the original sitting elf
image in the context of a parody, it still constitutes a transformative use.

This factor overall points in favor of fair use, for Defendant appropriated the copyrighted elements for a transformative
use, and not simply “to avoid the drudgery in working up something fresh....” Campbell,_510 U.S. at 580 , 114 S.Ct. 1164.

b. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second factor grants highest copyright protection to “original, creative works,” and less protection to “derivative
works or factual compilations.” Suntrust,_268 F.3d at 1271 . This factor is generally neutral in parody cases, due to their
reliance on well-known creative works. /d.

c. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

To succeed in its purpose, a parody must take enough identifiable elements from the original work to create the
reference to the original work. /d. at 1273. “When parody takes aim at a particular original work, the parody must be able to

‘conjure up’ at least enough of that original to make the object of its critical wit recognizable.” Campbell,_510 U.S. at 588 ,
114 S.Ct. 1164.

In creating a parody, the parodies may need to borrow the “heart” of the original to make its reference. Campbell,_510
U.S. at 588 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The elf doll and the sitting elf image are certainly the “heart” of theE/f On book. However,
Plaintiff's copyright claims are for Defendant's use of the elf doll and sitting elf image—not the entire book.

Viewed in this way, it is clear that Defendant borrowed the entire sitting elf image in two places and a substantial portion
of it on the front cover. Defendant also used the entire elf doll, but did change the color of its clothes. However, these
images make up only a small proportion of Elf Off.

In a similar case, Mattel, Inc. brought copyright infringement claims against a photographer who took photographs of
Barbie dolls in bizarre settings: a row of four Barbies wrapped in tortillas, covered in salsa, in a casserole dish in the oven


--- Page 6 ---
(entitled “Barbie Enchiladas”); Barbie on a malt machine; and other “various absurd
[819 F.Supp.2d 1323]

and often sexualized positions.” Mattel, Inc. v. Walking Mountain Prods., 353 F.3d 792 , 796 (9th Cir.2003). The artist
claimed he did so to create a parody that attacked the objectified image of women that Barbie promoted. /d. The Court
noted, in considering the amount and substantiality of the copyrighted work used, that it would be rather difficult to use only a
portion of a doll, and that the elements the defendant added to the dolls helped on this factor. “Here because the
copyrighted material is a doll design and the infringing work is a photograph containing that doll, Forsythe, short of severing
the doll, must add to it by creating a context around it and capturing that context in a photograph.” /d. at 804.

Defendant here has similarly used Plaintiff's copyrighted works in whole, but only as a portion of a new and different
creative work. The Court finds the amount and substantiality of elements borrowed and modified for Defendant's story are
reasonable.

d. Effect on the Market Value of the Original
The fourth fair use factor is concerned with the potential for market substitution of the allegedly infringing work.

Plaintiff has not clearly explained exactly how Defendant's use of the copyrighted works affects the market for those
particular works. Nothing in the record indicates the elf doll or sitting elf image, independent from the book, have any market
value whatsoever. Plaintiff has not represented that it sells the elf doll independently from the book. If that were the case, it
seems highly unlikely that Defendant's book of photographs of the elf doll would replace sales of the actual elf doll. Similarly,
it is unclear how the sitting elf image may be replaced in the marketplace, since it does not appear to have any particular
market. Plaintiff has not argued that its potential market for licensing the sitting elf image has been or will be replaced by the
dangling elf image or the photographs of Plaintiff's book cover with the sitting elf image. Plaintiff has neither identified a
particular market for the sitting elf image nor presented any argument for how the apparently nonexistent market will be
affected by Defendant's work.

Plaintiff instead argues that Defendant's uses will overall degrade the value of the market for its E/f On book. The flaw
in this argument is that Plaintiff has not alleged infringement of the story contained in E/f On. 8Even accepting Plaintiff's
contention that the relevant market at issue here is for Plaintiff's book, it is highly unlikely that consumers will choose an
inappropriate-for-children parody in lieu of the wholesome E/f On.

Although Plaintiff cites as evidence Defendant's stated goal of knocking a holiday favorite off its perch, such evidence
does not indicate that Defendant's book will replace sales of Plaintiff's product. (Pl.'s Br. Supp. Mot. at 6.) Even assuming
some

[819 F.Supp.2d 1324]

market for the copyrighted elf doll and sitting elf image, this factor does not involve the effect that any criticism or
commentary within a parody may have on the overall market value of the original. /d. at 1274. As a critical commentary, Elf
Off may knock Plaintiff's work down without affecting this factor. Plaintiff, in sum, has not clearly demonstrated any relevant
effect on its market. Thus, this factor supports a finding of fair use.

e. Copyright Likelihood of Success

Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of proving at this stage a substantial likelihood that Defendant's fair use defense
will not succeed. See Suntrust,_268 F.3d at 1276 (plaintiff seeking an injunction must refute the fair use defense where
defendant has asserted it). Therefore, Plaintiff has not established a substantial likelinood of success on the merits of its
copyright claims.

3. Trademark Infringement: Likelihood of Confusion

The Court next considers whether Plaintiff has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark claims
to warrant the entry of a preliminary injunction.

Plaintiff alleges both federal and common law trademark infringement. In Georgia, common law trademark claims
“involve the same dispositive issues as the claims under the Lanham Act.” Ferrellgas Partners, Inc. v. Barrow, 4:03-CV-—
107-WDO, 2006 WL 372602 (M.D.Ga. Feb. 16, 2006). “[T]o prevail on a trademark infringement claim, a plaintiff must show
that its mark was used in commerce by the defendant without the registrant's consent and that the unauthorized use was
likely to deceive, cause confusion, or result in mistake.” McDonald's Corp. v. Robertson, 147 F.3d 1301 , 1307 (11th
Cir.1998).

As Defendant has reserved the questions of whether Plaintiff owns the marks at issue and whether the marks are
eligible for trademark protection, 2the Court assumes for the purposes of this motion that Plaintiff has a right in the marks at
issue and that they are eligible for protection. Plaintiff argues that its word mark is infringed by Defendant's book title and
domain name, its stylized word mark is infringed by Defendant's similar font for the title of E/f Off, and its sitting elf logo is
infringed by Defendant's use of the dangling elf image on the front cover.


--- Page 7 ---
The second element for both federal and common law trademark claims is whether the Defendant has adopted a mark
similar to the protected trademark that is likely to cause consumer confusion. Tana v. Dantanna's, 611 F.3d 767 , 773 (11th
Cir.2010) (citing Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon, Inc. v. Longhorn Steaks, Inc., 106 F.3d 355 , 358 (11th Cir.1997)). The
likelihood of confusion element poses the greatest difficulty in the case, and thus comprises the bulk of the Court's analysis
of Plaintiff's trademark claims.

The parties agree for purposes of this motion that the trademarks at issue are strong and that Defendant's book uses
similar marks. Plaintiff argues that Defendant's use of its marks will cause consumer confusion as to the source of
Defendant's book. Plaintiff further argues that Defendant has borrowed its marks in an attempt to capitalize on Plaintiff's
success, and that Defendant has not in fact created a parody at all. Defendant contends that its use of Plaintiffs marks was
required in order to create a parody of Plaintiff's book, and as a parody, its use is not infringing.

[819 F.Supp.2d 1325]

The Eleventh Circuit has identified seven factors for the Court to consider to determine the likelihood of confusion: (1)
strength of the mark alleged to have been infringed; (2) similarity of the infringed and infringing marks; (3) similarity between
the goods and services offered under the two marks; (4) similarity of the actual sales methods used by the holders of the
marks, such as their sales outlets and customer base; (5) similarity of advertising methods; (6) intent of the alleged infringer
to misappropriate the proprietor's good will; and (7) the existence and extent of actual confusion in the consuming public.
Tana, 611 F.3d at 774 -75.

Use as a parody is not a defense in trademark infringement but is a factor that “influences the way the likelihood of
confusion factors are applied.” Smith, 537 F.Supp.2d at 1317 . The Court now considers each of the likelihood of confusion
factors in turn. Because Defendant's domain name is identical to the title that allegedly infringes Plaintiff's word mark, and
the website prominently displays the image of the book cover, the Court's evaluation of these factors in the context of the
book cover applies equally to Defendant's website.

a. Strength of Plaintiff's Mark

“The ‘strength’ of a mark is the measure of its distinctiveness.” /d. at 1335. Here the parties both claim that Plaintiff's
marks are strong. In general, the stronger the mark, the higher the protection the mark receives.

In a parody case, the strength of the plaintiff's mark may reduce the likelihood of confusion, as consumers are more
likely to recognize the defendant's use is in jest. /d. (citing Hormel Foods Corp. v. Jim Henson Prods., Inc., 73 F.3d 497 ,
503 (2d Cir.1996)). In Smith, the defendant borrowed ubiquitous Wal-Mart marks to criticize the brand through parody. Due
to the widespread consumer recognition of the Wal-Mart brand, the court found that consumers were unlikely to mistake the
parody for the original, noting that “parody depends on lack of confusion to make its point.” Smith, 537 F.Supp.2d at 1335 .

In this case, although both parties agree that Plaintiff's marks are “strong,” the Court is not certain Plaintiff's marks are
particularly distinctive. The use of an elf in a Christmas-theme gift set is not a unique idea. At best, E/f Onis well known
within a particular sub-set of the population. This sub-set comprises both Plaintiff and Defendant's target audience. For
purposes of this motion, because the parties contend the mark is strong, the Court assumes the mark is strong. 12Given that
with parody a strong mark reduces the likelihood of confusion, this factor weighs in favor of Defendant.

b. Similarity of Marks

A successful trademark parody borrows some of the original mark in order to make its commentary on the senior mark.
Id. at 1336. The debate in such a case is “whether [Defendant's] designs contained so much [of Plaintiff's] indicia that they
became ineffective as parodies and instead appeared to be actually associated with or sponsored by” Plaintiff. /d. Here,
Plaintiff argues that Defendant has borrowed so much of the cover and the marks included therein that consumers will be

confused or consider E/f Offa “sequel” affiliated with or sponsored by Elf On. Conversely, Defendant acknowledges it has
borrowed Plaintiff's marks, but defends

[819 F.Supp.2d 1326]

its actions by saying the publication needed to borrow enough of the marks to make the reference requisite for effective
parody.

Where the marks share similar sight, sound, and meaning, and are used to denote similar products, this factor
generally weighs in favor of the plaintiff. Frehling Enters.. Inc. v. Int'l Select Group, Inc., 192 F.3d 1330 , 1337 (11th
Cir.1999). In this case, at minimum, the sight and sound are extremely similar. Defendant borrowed the same font style
Plaintiff trademarked, modifying only the color. Changing the final consonant in one preposition (the change from “on” to
“off”) does very little to distinguish the two titles in terms of sound. (On the other hand, the meaning of “ off the shelf” is
obviously somewhat different than “ on the shelf.”)

“[S]omewhat more risk of confusion is to be tolerated when a trademark holder seeks to enjoin artistic expression such
as a parody.” Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Pub. Group, Inc., 886 F.2d 490 , 495 (2d Cir.1989) (finding parody
of Cliffs Notes books to be non-infringing where multiple distinguishing factors were included).



--- Page 8 ---
Although at first glance consumers might not notice all the distinctions between the two products, the first glance is not
decisive. The Court is concerned primarily with whether the ordinarily prudent consumer would be confused. /d. Courts have
tolerated momentary confusion where it can be readily dispelled upon further consideration prior to purchase. “That a person
cannot tell the difference between the two from across the room matters little.” Nike, Inc. v. Just Did It Enters., 6 F.3d 1225 ,
1229-30 (7th Cir.1993) (overturning summary judgment for plaintiff because a jury could find use of “Mike” over a Nike
swoosh on an advertised t-shirt was parodical and would not confuse the consuming public engaged in the purchasing
process, “as MIKE and NIKE, in text, meaning, and pronunciation, are not so similar as to confuse consumers, especially
when making the decision to purchase or not to purchase.”) In Yankee Pub. Inc. v. News America Pub. Inc., 809 F.Supp.
267 (S.D.N.Y.1992) , New York magazine published an issue using a parody of the The Old Farmer's Almanac cover and
contents, presenting for its annual Christmas gift issue a tongue-in-cheek list of “thrifty” gift ideas. The joke turned on the
contrast between New York's message of “frivolous trendy, inconstant, stylish, changeable, urbane glorification of
consumption” and the Almanac's advocacy of “rusticity, thrift, homespun good sense, homely time-honored adages,
practicality, permanence” and a general rejection of New York's values. /d. at 271. The court found no likelihood of
confusion, in spite of plaintiff's concern that consumers might not immediately recognize the parody from viewing the cover
alone. “Even if the first glance at the cover were to cause momentary confusion, a further look into the magazine would
dispel it.” /d. at 273.

Reasonable consumers faced with purchasing a children's book are likely to open the book to see what they are buying
for their children. Upon examination of Defendant's book, consumers, even without opening it, can see the smaller size font
informing them that the book is a “parody” and “for Mom and Dad.” Looking inside, they are likely to find on any given page
an indication they are not looking at a children's book. They may find Defendant's disclaimer stating it is not affiliated with
Plaintiff. They may see the bizarre rhymes about “that stupid toy train” or Barbie being a prude. They may notice the
photographs of an elf watching x-rated videos like “Elves Gone WILD.” These multiple distinctions go far to dispel consumer
confusion. They also further address the larger question of whether

[819 F.Supp.2d 1327]

Defendant has borrowed so much of Plaintiff's work that the parody becomes a copy. Consumers, particularly those buying
books, are likely to notice significant literary distinctions. This factor therefore weighs in favor of Defendant.

c. Similarity of Products

“This factor requires a determination as to whether the products are the kind that the public attributes to a single
source, not whether or not the purchasing public can readily distinguish between the products of the respective parties.”
Frehling, 192 F.3d at 1338 . If “the goods are so related in the minds of consumers that they get the sense that a single
producer is likely to put out both goods,” this factor indicates a likelihood of consumer confusion. /d.

Since both parties are selling books, one of which comes with a toy doll, reasonable consumers could assume both
books came from the same source. Although arguably the inclusion of the elf doll with Plaintiffs book makes it a slightly
different product, +t consumers may assume Defendant's book is a related derivative work produced by the same source as
the original.

However, in cases where courts have found significant differences notifying consumers that one of the marks is a
parody of the other, even identical products have been treated as a neutral factor. See, e.g., Jordache Enterprises, Inc. v.
Hogg Wyld, Ltd., 828 F.2d 1482 (10th Cir.1987) (finding parody of Jordache jeans, “Lardashe” jeans, to be non-infringing);
Black Dog Tavern Co., Inc. v. Hall, 823 F.Supp. 48 (D.Mass.1993) (finding Black Hog and Dead Dog t-shirts that parodied

Black Dog t-shirts to be non-infringing, because consumers would notice a difference between a hog and a dog and would
not assume the macabre overtones of the Dead Dog related to the Black Dog).

Because some amount of similarity is required to accomplish the parody, it is difficult to imagine how Defendant could
have created its parody without a book, although this book need not have been identical in length and width dimensions or
“first glance” presentation as Elf On. Defendant notably did not include an elf doll, which suggests this factor weighs only
slightly in favor of Plaintiff.

d. Similarity of Sales Methods and Customers

This factor considers which consumers buy the parties’ products as well as where and how they buy them. Frehling,
192 F.3d at 1339 . Sales in similar stores, for example, may provide strong evidence of likelihood of confusion.

Plaintiff complains of the overlap in sales methods, as Defendant plans to market its book using some or most of the
same major retail outlets as Plaintiff, including Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble. Defendant points out that its book
targets an entirely different audience than Plaintiff's. Plaintiffs counsel argued that both children and adults buy E/f On and
will be confused and mistakenly buy Defendant's book. However, the Court finds that parents are usually the purchasers
even when the target audience for a book is children, so the argument that child consumers will be confused is not
persuasive.

[819 F.Supp.2d 1328]


--- Page 9 ---
Defendant's book targets the parents of children who have come to know and love Plaintiff's book. However, this
distinction between readers of the two books does not significantly change the demographics of the customers. Parents of
children interested in Elf On are the target consumers for both products. The parties share multiple sales methods. This
factor weighs in favor of Plaintiff.

e. Similarity of Advertising

The parties' advertising strategies, at this early stage, appear to target the same online outlets they are using to market
their products. Although Plaintiff submitted evidence at the hearing related to online searches for its books, such evidence
does not go to the heart of Defendant's advertising strategies. It is unclear, for example, whether Defendant has worked with
internet search providers in order to make its product or website show up in searches for Plaintiff's product. This information
may be revealed through discovery. Although the overlap in online markets as advertising suggests this factor may weigh in
favor of Plaintiff at trial, with the minimal evidence Plaintiff has presented, this factor is neutral at this stage.

f. Defendant's Intent

Plaintiff argues that Defendant's actual intent is to use Plaintiff's successful mark as a commercial reference point,
without regard to any interest in parody. Defendant argues its intention was to capitalize on a current successful trend of
publishing adult parodies of children's books. Defendant further points to the use of the word “parody” on the cover to
indicate to consumers the book is published as a parody, rather than a sequel or other derivative work. A real intent to
parody may be strong evidence that the alleged infringement was not motivated by an intent to confuse the public. See, e.g.,
Jordache, 828 F.2d at 1486 .

Defendant also included a disclaimer of affiliation inside the book. Where a defendant included both a clear disclaimer
and some form of criticism, this factor has been considered to weigh in favor of the defendant. Smith, 537 F.Supp.2d at 1338
. Here, Defendant includes both criticism in the form of parody and a disclaimer. Thus, this factor weighs in favor of
Defendant.

g. Existence of Actual Confusion

Plaintiff has presented no evidence of actual consumer confusion. This evidence is frequently a key factor in finding
likelihood of confusion in trademark parody cases. See, e.g., Anheuser— Busch, Inc. v. Balducci Publications,28 F.3d 769 ,
772 (8th Cir.1994) (finding a fake magazine advertisement for “Michelob Oily” to be infringing where the ad was too similar
to Michelob's marks and included no disclaimer of association, and plaintiffs presented survey evidence of consumer
confusion); Anheuser— Busch, Inc. v. VIP Products, LLC, 666 F.Supp.2d 974 , 977 (E.D.Mo.2008) (granting preliminary
injunction to plaintiff who showed survey evidence that consumers could not tell whether defendant's “Buttwiper” dog toy
was associated with Budweiser); Schieffelin & Co. v. Jack Co. of Boca, Inc., 850 F.Supp. 232 , 246 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (finding
defendant's “Dom Popignon” popcorn sold in a champagne-bottle shaped package infringed plaintiff's Dom Perignon mark,
where plaintiff presented survey evidence of consumer confusion). Absent such evidence, at this stage, this factor is neutral.

h. Trademark Likelihood of Success

Some parodies may indeed confuse consumers. When they do, however, they often lack expressive elements or clear
indications of parody. See, e.g., Eli Lilly & Co. v. Natural Answers, Inc., 233 F.3d 456 (2000) (finding defendant's herbal
supplement entitled “Herbrozac” to infringe

[819 F.Supp.2d 1329]

plaintiffs mark “Prozac” where Herbrozac was marketed as a mood enhancer and made no humorous or critical reference to
Prozac); Anheuser-Busch, 28 F.3d 769 ; Anheuser-Busch, 666 F.Supp.2d 974 ; Schieffelin, 850 F.Supp. 232 .

Where some aspect of the work clearly communicates to consumers that it is a parody, or where the medium in which
the marks are used is inherently expressive (such as artistic photographs), courts protect that expression. See Smith, 537
F.Supp.2d 1302 , (finding parodies of Wal-Mart marks to be non-infringing as they incorporated critical commentary) Cliffs
Notes, 886 F.2d 490 ; Black Dog, 823 F.Supp. 48 ; Jordache, 828 F.2d at 1486 ; Yankee, 809 F.Supp. 267 . See also,
Lucasfilm Ltd. v. Media Market Group, Ltd., 182 F.Supp.2d 897 , 901 (N.D.Cal.2002) (in case involving a pornographic film
parodying the famous Star Wars movies, preliminary injunction denied because “no reasonable consumer is likely to be
confused between Star Wars and Starballz, which is labeled as an adult film, is animated, and is rarely sold in the same
marketing channels as Star Wars. ”).

While the two books in this case may be in the same marketing channels, Defendant's book is labeled as a parody for
parents and its primary pictorial content consists of absurd photographs rather than soft edged watercolor illustrations
intended to appeal to children. “Denying parodists the opportunity to poke fun at symbols and names which have become
woven into the fabric of our daily life, would constitute a serious curtailment of a protected form of expression.” L.L. Bean.
Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., 811 F.2d 26 , 34 (1st Cir.1987) (finding that First Amendment rights trumped trademark claims
when defendant created “prurient parody” of the L.L. Bean catalog).

The Court finds that the balance of the factors weighs against a finding of likelihood of confusion. Plaintiff holds a mark


--- Page 10 ---
that its consumers are likely to recognize in a parody. Defendant has included distinctions between its marks and Plaintiff's
to minimize consumer confusion, although the Court recognizes the first impressions of the books covers may result in
some minor initial consumer confusion. The differences between the marks in context sufficiently outweigh the similarities in
product and sales methods. Finally, Defendant has clearly made a good-faith effort to parody Plaintiff's work. Its efforts
include a disclaimer and the use of the word “parody” in boldface on the cover of the book. The Court finds these steps
sufficiently distinguish the marks, identify the parody, and reduce any likelihood of confusion. Similarly, because the domain
name leads to a website that includes Defendant's book cover, the overall impact is to convey parody, not to confuse
consumers.

C. Irreparable Harm, Balance of Harms, and Public Interest

Plaintiff has asserted it will suffer irreparable harm with regard to its copyright claims without a preliminary injunction.
Even if Plaintiff had adequately shown a likelihood of success on the copyright claims, which would generally support a
presumption of irreparable harm, “the Supreme Court has made clear that there is no presumption of irreparable injury when
the alleged infringer has a bona fide fair use defense.” Suntrust,_268 F.3d at 1276 . Plaintiff has neither met its burden with
regard to likelihood of success nor identified any irreparable harm other than the presumed harm that is rejected in the face
of a fair use defense.

A strong likelihood of confusion caused by trademark infringement may constitute threat of irreparable harm. E. Remy
Martin & Co., S.A. v. Shaw-Ross Int'l Imports, Inc.,756 F.2d 1525 , 1530 (11th Cir.1985). Having failed to make an

[819 F.Supp.2d 1330]

adequate showing of likelihood of confusion, Plaintiff is not entitled to a presumption of irreparable harm from the alleged
trademark infringement. Moreover, Plaintiff has not presented any evidence of irreparable harm in connection with its
trademark claims. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden with regard to irreparable harms.

The Court next weighs the potential harm to the parties respectively. Defendant projects significant loss of sales if
enjoined from distributing its book prior to the holiday season. Defendant plans to debut E/f Offfor sales around the 2011
holiday season. A preliminary injunction until a trial on the merits would eliminate this prime time for Defendant's book
marketing. Further, Defendant's counsel argued that F + W Media hopes to take advantage of a growing trend of made-for-
adult parodies of children's books, a fad that may end before a trial on the merits is completed. In short, Defendant has
identified a narrow window of time for sales that could be erased entirely if its publication is enjoined on a preliminary
injunction. The Court concludes that Defendant's potential harm here outweighs the more speculative risk of harm alleged by
Plaintiff.

With regard to the public interest, both trademark and copyright law offer protection for parodic use of intellectual
property, consistent with the strong public interest in protecting free speech and expression. Thus, in a case presenting a
parody that criticizes an original work, the public interest in protecting that expression is of the highest level.

IV. CONCLUSION

Plaintiff has failed to meet its high burden for preliminary injunctive relief. Consequently, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's
motion for preliminary injunction [Doc. 2].

[819 F.Supp.2d 1331]
Exhibit A

Notes:

The parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal without prejudice of Defendants O'Neill, Gissinger, and Faria on
August 11, 2011. (Doc. 34.) On September 16, 2011, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal of Adams Media, Inc. (Doc.
42.), a sub-division of Defendant F + W Media, Inc. Accordingly, F + W Media, Inc. is now the sole defendant in this matter.

2.The parties submitted their respective publications for the Court to review. The Court cites the books directly when
the photocopies of the books submitted as exhibits do not show the relevant details.

3.|mages of the front covers of both books are attached at the end of this opinion in Exhibit A.
4.For examples of Carroll's poetic parodies, see http:// www. durrant. co. uk/ alice/.

5Defendant could have done a better job of conveying to consumers looking at the book jacket that E/f Offis a parody
and nota sequel to Elf On. A different font stacked in the same way as Plaintiff's would similarly have more sharply
distinguished the two books. Embellishing the image of the elf dangling off the shelf in a humorous “naughty” way similarly
would have more evocatively communicated the parodic nature of the book. Although Plaintiff has not established a
likelihood of consumer confusion arising as a result of the book's cover, the facts at this early stage of the case do suggest
an arguable possibility of consumer confusion. Plaintiff potentially could present survey evidence proving consumer



--- Page 11 ---
confusion at trial. In light of this, Defendant may wish to consider taking additional measures to distinguish the cover of Elf
Off before marketing it.

£.The weight courts give to the commercial purpose element changed after the Supreme Court clarified in Campbell

that it was not outcome-determinative: “If indeed, commerciality carried presumptive force against a finding of fairness, the
presumption would swallow nearly all of the illustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of § 107, including news

reporting, comment, criticism ... since these activities ‘are generally conducted for profit in this country.’ ” 510 U.S. at 584 ,

114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal citations omitted). This is one reason the Court does not find_Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v.
Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., 642 F.Supp. 1031 (N.D.Ga.1986) , heavily relied on by Plaintiff, persuasive in this case. Its
analysis of the copyright and trademark infringement factors in a parody context is outdated, if not expressly overruled.

ZWhile this image of the book does include a nearly exact replica of the sitting elf image, the photograph is a very
small portion of Defendant's work and primarily provides a distinguishing reference to the original. Where the reference to an
original copyrighted work is small in proportion to the whole, the use may be considered “inconsequential.” See Bill Graham

Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd.. 448 F.3d 605 , 611 (2d Cir.2006).

8.While the idea superficially makes sense, this argument tends to conflate trademark and copyright. If Plaintiff is
arguing that the use of a logo similar to the logo on its book will confuse consumers as to the source of the book, and
therefore will cause Plaintiff's book market to be supplanted, this argument belongs with its trademark claims. To succeed on
its copyright claims, Plaintiff must identify the market for the elf doll and sitting elf image and explain how this market is
affected by Defendant's book. If Plaintiff truly intends to argue Defendant's book will deplete its market for E/f On, Plaintiff
must bring copyright claims for the book itself, not merely logos and products related to it. Plaintiff must clearly explain how
and why an allegedly infringing use will replace the original or any derivative works in the marketplace. See Suntrust Bank v.
Houghton Mifflin Co., 268 F.3d 1257 , 1265 (11th Cir.2001) (“ ‘[E]vidence about relevant markets' is also crucial to the fair
use defense.” /d. (citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. at 1177 )).

Defendant argues that “Plaintiff is not entitled to the relief sought even if ownership and validity are established.”
(Defs.' Mem. Opp'n Mot. at 3.)

10.While proceeding on this premise, the Court's ruling does not definitively establish the strength of Plaintiff's mark.

1.Notably, the inclusion of the doll with the book in one package entitles the Plaintiff to trademark The E/f on the Shelf

title, whereas book titles are not normally eligible for trademark protection without proof of secondary meaning. “[U]nlike
ordinary marks, literary titles of single works which are inherently distinctive are not accorded immediate protection, absent
proof of secondary meaning and consumer recognition.” 2 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 10:2 (4th ed.).

CHANNEL 781 NEWS, Plaintiff,
v.
WALTHAM COMMUNITY ACCESS CORPORATION, Defendant.

Civil Action No. 24-cv-11927-PBS
United States District Court, D. Massachusetts
January 6, 2025
ORDER
Hon. Patti B. Saris United States District Judge

Plaintiff Channel 781 News (“Channel 781”) operates a YouTube channel with videos of news about the City of
Waltham, Massachusetts. Some of these videos are clips of meetings of the Waltham City Council that Channel 781
excerpts from recordings of the full meetings posted online by Defendant Waltham Community Access Corporation
(‘WCAC’). In September 2023, WCAC sent multiple takedown notices to YouTube claiming that Channel 781's videos
amounted to copyright infringement. YouTube temporarily removed the videos and disabled Channel 781's channel.
Contending that its videos constituted fair use, Channel 781 sued WCAC under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) for knowingly and
materially misrepresenting in its takedown notices that Channel 781's videos were infringing. WCAC now moves to dismiss
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

2

12(b)(6). See Conformis, Inc. v. Aetna, Inc. ,58 F.4th 517 , 52728 (1st Cir. 2023) (describing Rule 12(b)(6) standard).

WCAC argues that Channel 781 has not plausibly pled that its videos were fair use and, thus, that WCAC

misrepresented that the videos were infringing. See Monsarrat v. Newman, 28 F.4th 314 , 321 (1st Cir. 2022) (describing
air use and relevant factors). | disagree. Channel 781 alleges 1) that WCAC's recordings are factual records of the meetings

with little creative expression, see id. at 323 (“The scope of fair use is narrower when works ‘fall closer to the creative end of
he copyright spectrum than the informational or factual end’. . . .” (quoting Soc'y of the Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Inc.
v. Gregory , 689 F.3d 29 , 62 (1st Cir. 2012))); 2) that Channel 781's videos are short clips from WCAC's recordings that
reflect editorial judgments about newsworthy segments, see 17 U.S.C. § 107 (listing “news reporting” as a purpose that
ypically constitutes fair use); Nunez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp. , 235 F.3d 18 , 24 (1st Cir. 2000) (asking if the amount of
copying “is consistent with or more than necessary to further ‘the purpose and character of the use’” (quoting Castle Rock
Ent., Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Grp. , 150 F.3d 132 , 144 (2d Cir. 1998))); and 3) that neither WCAC nor Channel 781 operates for

profit or makes money directly from the works at issue, see Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. , 593 U.S. 1, 32 (2021) (“[A]
inding that copying was not commercial in nature tips the scales in favor of

3

air use.”). Without taking a firm position on Channel 781's claim of fair use at this stage, the Court concludes that it is at
least plausible.

Alternatively, WCAC contends that Channel 781 has failed to plausibly allege a knowing misrepresentation actionable
under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f). A copyright holder “faces liability if it knowingly misrepresented in the takedown notification that it
had formed a good faith belief the video was not authorized by the law, i.e. , did not constitute fair use.” Lenz v. Universal
Music Corp. , 815 F.3d 1145, 1154 (9th Cir. 2016). Channel 781 alleges that before sending the takedown notices, WCAC
stated that it would take action against those using its “content to score political points” or “encourage residents to hate.” Dkt.
1 ¢ 28. In later discussions between the parties, Channel 781 explained why it believed its videos constituted fair use. See
id. Jf 29-30, 35. WCAC responded that “ any use of the clips by Channel 781 required permission” and that Channel 781's
videos “would be more acceptable to WCAC if Channel 781 used them only to report facts, but not to express opinions or
further an agenda.” /d. {31-32 (emphasis added). These allegations support a reasonable inference that WCAC sent the
takedown notices based on factors other than a good faith belief that Channel 781's videos were not fair use and that WCAC
knew it was doing so. See Lenz , 815 F.3d at 1154 (explaining that

4

if a copyright holder fails to “consider fair use before sending a takedown notification, it is liable for damages under § 512(f)”).
Channel 781 has adequately pled a misrepresentation claim under § 512(f).

Accordingly, the Court DENIES WCAC's motion to dismiss (Dkt. 16).
SO ORDERED.

OPINION AND ORDER

JED S. RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.

[551 F.Supp.3d 191]

Plaintiff Paul Nicklen captured footage of a starving polar bear and posted the video to his Instagram and Facebook
accounts. Dozens of news outlets and online publishers, including Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. and its affiliates
(collectively, the ""Sinclair Defendants""), embedded the video in online articles without first obtaining a license. Nicklen then
sued the Sinclair Defendants for copyright infringement. The Sinclair Defendants now move to dismiss the Second
Amended Complaint, arguing that embedding a video does not ""display"" the video within the meaning of the Copyright Act
and that the video's inclusion in an article about the video's popularity was fair use. For the reasons that follow, the Court
denies the motion to dismiss.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

|. Factual Allegations

The following allegations are presumed true for purposes of the motion to dismiss. Paul Nicklen is a Canadian nature
photographer,

[551 F.Supp.3d 192]

filmmaker, and founder of the nonprofit conservationist organization SeaLegacy. Second Am. Compl. (""SAC""), ECF No. 72,
at 4 2, 9. Nicklen is the author and registered copyright owner of a video of an emaciated polar bear wandering the
Canadian Arctic (""the Video""). See SAC 4 159, 169; see also SAC, Exs. 4, 4A. On December 5, 2017, Nicklen posted the


--- Page 2 ---
Video to his Instagram and Facebook accounts. SAC 4 5; see also SAC, Ex. 7. In a caption, Nicklen urged his social media
followers to consider the ""haunt[ing]"" and ""soul-crushing scene"" and to take steps to mitigate the harms of climate change.
SAC, Ex. 7. Nicklen added that ""[w]e must reduce our carbon footprint, eat the right food, stop cutting down our forests, and
begin putting the Earth -- our home -- first."" Id. He then invited his followers to ""join us at @sea_legacy as we search for and
implement solutions for the oceans and the animals that rely on them -- including us humans."" Id. Finally, the caption noted
that the Video ""is exclusively managed by Caters News"" and directed those seeking ""[t]o license or use [the Video] ina
commercial player"" to contact Caters News. Id. ;see also SAC 4 5.

Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. is a Maryland-based media conglomerate that owns ""over 200"" local television stations and
118 wholly owned subsidiaries nationwide (""Sinclair Affiliates""). SAC 44 11-12; SAC, Ex. 2.; see also Def. Mot., ECF No. 78,
at 1. On or around December 11, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group published an article titled ""Starving polar bear goes viral in
heartbreaking video."" SAC, Ex. 5. Sinclair Broadcast Group included the Video in this article using the Instagram or
Facebook application programing interface (""API"") embed tool. Id. at § 158. Sinclair Broadcast Group ""embedded"" the Video
by including in its website an HTML code provided by Instagram or Facebook that directed web browsers to retrieve the
Video from the Instagram or Facebook server for viewing on Sinclair's website. See SAC § 158-60. The Video appeared
within the body of the Sinclair article even when a reader took no action to retrieve the Video or to navigate to Nicklen's
Facebook or Instagram account, and even when a reader did not have a Facebook or Instagram account. Id. at {{ 160-61.

The Sinclair Broadcast Group article opens by stating that ""[a] photograph of a polar bear is grabbing attention as it shows
the animal slowly succumbing to starvation."" SAC, Ex. 6. The article goes on to repeat quotes Nicklen gave to National
Geographic and to explain that Nicklen ""advocated for the reduction of the carbon footprint,"" quoting the portion of Nicklen's
Instagram caption that described the polar bear population's battle against extinction. Id. The article closes by noting that""
[t]he video has already reached over 1 million views on Facebook."" Id. Nicklen alleges upon information and belief that this
Sinclair Broadcast Group article was reposted -- and the Video was re-embedded -- on all television station websites
operated by the Sinclair Defendants. SAC § 170.

Though Nicklen provided licensing information in the text of his Instagram post, the Sinclair Defendants did not obtain a
license or Nicklen's consent before embedding the Video. SAC 9 162, 285. On or about December 8, 2020, Nicklen sent
the Sinclair Affiliates a takedown notice, but the Video remains displayed on television station websites owned by Sinclair
Broadcast Group, Inc. and Sinclair Affiliates. SAC §§ 170, 178.

Il. Procedural Background
[551 F.Supp.3d 193]

Nicklen and Christina Mittermeier + sued the Sinclair Defendants, among others, for copyright infringement. ECF No. 7.
Nicklen filed a First Amended Complaint adding class allegations. See ECF No. 11. Nicklen then filed a Second Amended
Complaint, identifying each Sinclair affiliate and the URL of each infringing article. See ECF No. 72.

In the operative complaint, Nicklen alleges that by embedding Nicklen's copyrighted video on Sinclair websites using the
Instagram or Facebook API, the Sinclair Defendants infringed his exclusive reproduction, distribution, and display rights in
violation of 17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1), (3), and (5). See SAC 4 284-85. Nicklen alleges in the alternative that Sinclair Broadcast
Group is liable for inducing the copyright infringement of its affiliates. Id. at ¢] 291-95. The Sinclair Defendants move to
dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. ECF No. 85.

LEGAL STANDARD

On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court ""accepi{s] all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and
draw[s] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs’ favor."" Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Dev. Corp. , 602 F.3d
57 , 61 (2d Cir. 2010) (quotingHolmes v. Grubman , 568 F.3d 329 , 335 (2d Cir. 2009) ). ""Threadbare recitals of the
elements of a cause of action"" and conclusory allegations are not presumed true. Ashcroft v. Iqbal _ 556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129
S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) . Disregarding legal conclusions couched as fact, ""a complaint must contain sufficient
factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.’ "" Dane v. UnitedHealthcare Ins. Co. ,
974 F.3d 183 , 188 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoting Iqbal . 556 U.S. at 678 , 129 S.Ct. 1937 ). A claim for relief is facially plausible
when the plaintiff ""pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable
for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 , 129 S.Ct. 1937 .

DISCUSSION

|. Copyright Infringement

To state a claim for copyright infringement, a plaintiff must plead ownership of a valid copyright and that the defendant has
violated at least one of the owner's exclusive rights under 17 U.S.C. § 106 : reproduction, public performance, public display,
creation of derivative works, and distribution. See, e.g. , Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3 , 604 F.3d 110 , 117 (2d Cir. 2010).

Nicklen has pleaded ownership of a valid copyright. See SAC {| 159, 169; see also SAC, Ex. 4A. Nicklen also asserts that
by embedding the Video, the Sinclair Defendants violated his exclusive right to display the Video publicly. See SAC { 284.
The fundamental question at issue here is whether embedding a video ""displays"" the video within the meaning of the
Copyright Act of 1976. This Court concludes that it does.

Under the Copyright Act, ""[t]o ‘display’ a work means to show a copy of it, either directly or by means of a film, slide,


--- Page 3 ---
television image, or any other device or process or, in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to show
individual images nonsequentially.""

[551 F.Supp.3d 194]

17 U.S.C. § 101. A device or process is defined as ""one now known or later developed,"" id. , and to show means ""to cause
or permit to be seen."" See Show , Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary , https:/www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/show

""show"" as ""[t]o present or display (an object) in order that it may be looked at; to expose or exhibit to view""). Thus, under the
plain meaning of the Copyright Act, a defendant violates an author's exclusive right to display an audiovisual work publicly
when the defendant without authorization causes a copy of the work, or individual images of the work, to be seen -- whether
directly or by means of any device or process known in 1976 or developed thereafter.

In 1976, Congress crafted a broad display right, conscious that section 106(5) ""represent[ed] the first explicit statutory
recognition in American copyright law of an exclusive right to show a copyrighted work, or an image of it, to the public."" H.R.
Rep. No. 94-1476, at 63 (1976). The display right as initially drafted was ""analogous to the traditional common-law right of
first publication in a literary work, or to the moral right of divulgation in continental law, but that right would cease as soon as
a copy of the work was transferred."" R. Anthony Reese, The Public Display Right: The Copyright Act's Neglected Solution to
the Controversy Over RAM ""Copies"" , 2001 U. of Ill. L. Rev. 83, 95 (2001). But this approach was ultimately set aside. The
display right in its final form encompasses ""not only the initial rendition or showing, but also any further act by which that
rendition or showing is transmitted or communicated to the public."" H.R. Rep. 94-1476, at 63. As such, an infringer displays
a work by showing ""a copy"" of the work -- not the first copy, or the only copy, but any copy of the work. See 17 U.S.C. § 101.

Further, the exclusive display right set forth in the Copyright Act is technology-neutral, covering displays made directly or by
means of any device or process ""now known or later developed."" The concept of ""display"" thus includes ""the projection of an
image on a screen or other surface by any method, the transmission of an image by electronic or other means, and the

showing of an image on a cathode ray tube, or similar viewing apparatus connected with any sort of information storage and
retrieval system."" H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 64 (1976). The right is concerned not with how a work is shown, but that a work
is shown.

The Copyright Act's text and history establish that embedding a video on a website ""displays"" that video, because to embed
a video is to show the video or individual images of the video nonsequentially by means of a device or process. Nicklen
alleges that the Sinclair Defendants included in their web pages an HTML code that caused the Video to ""appear[ ]"" within
the web page ""no differently than other content within the Post,"" although ""the actual Video ... was stored on Instagram's
server."" SAC ff 160-61. The embed code on the Sinclair Defendants’ webpages is simply an information ""retrieval system""
that permits the Video or an individual image of the Video to be seen. The Sinclair Defendants’ act of embedding therefore
falls squarely within the display right.

The Sinclair Defendants nevertheless insist that embedding is not display and ask the Court to adopt the Ninth Circuit's
""server rule."" Under that rule, a website publisher displays an image by ""using a computer to fill a computer screen with a
copy of the photographic image fixed in the computer's memory.""

[551 F.Supp.3d 195]

Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. , 508 F.3d 1146 , 1160 (9th Cir. 2007). In contrast, when a website publisher embeds
an image, HTML code ""gives the address of the image to the user's browser"" and the browser ""interacts with the [third-party]
computer that stores the infringing image."" Id. Because the image remains on a third-party's server and is not fixed in the
memory of the infringer's computer, therefore, under the ""server rule,"" embedding is not display. Id.

The server rule is contrary to the text and legislative history of the Copyright Act. The Act defines to display as ""to show a
copy of"" a work, 17 U.S.C. § 101, not ""to make and then show a copy of the copyrighted work."" The Ninth Circuit's
approach, under which no display is possible unless the alleged infringer has also stored a copy of the work on the
infringer's computer, makes the display right merely a subset of the reproduction right. See Jane C. Ginsburg & Luke Ali
Budiardjo, Embedding Content or Interring Copyright: Does the Internet Need the ""Server Rule""? , 32 Colum. J. L. & Arts
417, 430 (2019) (explaining that the server rule ""convert[s] the display right into an atrophied appendage of the reproduction
right"" and thereby ""ignores Congress's endeavor to ensure that the full ‘bundle’ of exclusive rights will address evolving
modes of exploitation of works""). Further, the server rule distinguishes between showing a copy possessed by the infringer
and showing a copy possessed by someone else. See Perfect 10 . 508 F.3d at 1161 (concluding that ""Google does not ...
display a copy of full-size infringing photographic images for purposes of the Copyright Act"" because ""Google does not have
a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act""). As discussed above, when a copy of a work is shown, the
Copyright Act makes no such distinction. See, e.g. ,Am. Broad. Companies, Inc. v. Aereo, Inc. . 573 U.S. 431 , 441-48, 134
S.Ct. 2498 , 189 L.Ed.2d 476 (2014) (holding that, despite technological complexity concerning the ""behind-the-scenes""
delivery of images, the defendant violated the exclusive right to ""show [an audiovisual work's] images in any sequence,""
because ""whether Aereo transmits from the same or separate copies, it ... shows the same images and makes audible the
same sound""). Rather, to ""show a copy"" is to display it. 17 U.S.C. § 101.

Further, the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in Perfect 10 should be cabined by two facts specific to that case: (1) the defendant
operated a search engine and (2) the copyrighted images were displayed only if a user clicked on a link. See Goldman v.
Breitbart News Network, LLC , 302 F. Supp. 3d 585, 595 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (distinguishingPerfect 10 on these grounds).
When a user ""open{s] up a favorite blog or website to find a full color image awaiting the user, whether he or she asked for



--- Page 4 ---
it, looked for it, clicked on it, or not,"" the Ninth Circuit's approach is inapt. See id. This case does not involve a search engine,
and Nicklen alleges that no user intervention was required to display the Video's individual images nonsequentially. An
individual still image from the Video awaits Sinclair readers whether they click the image to play the video or not. Thus,
Perfect 10 ’s test is a poor fit for this case, and the Court declines to adopt it.

Proponents of the server rule suggest that a contrary rule would impose far-reaching and ruinous liability, supposedly
grinding the internet to a halt. These speculations seem farfetched, but are, in any case, just speculations. Moreover, the
alternative provided by the server rule is no more palatable. Under the server rule, a photographer who promotes his work
on Instagram or a filmmaker who posts her short film on YouTube surrenders control over how, when, and by whom their
work

[551 F.Supp.3d 196]

is subsequently shown -- reducing the display right, effectively, to the limited right of first publication that the Copyright Act

of 1976 rejects. The Sinclair Defendants argue that an author wishing to maintain control over how a work is shown could
abstain from sharing the work on social media, pointing out that if Nicklen removed his work from Instagram, the Video would
disappear from the Sinclair Defendants’ websites as well. But it cannot be that the Copyright Act grants authors an exclusive
right to display their work publicly only if that public is not online.

For the foregoing reasons, Nicklen has plausibly alleged that by embedding the Video without authorization, the Sinclair
Defendants violated the display right.

ll. Fair Use

""Fair use"" of a copyrighted work is not copyright infringement, 17 U.S.C. § 107, but the defendant bears the burden of
showing that a use is fair. Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 213 (2d Cir. 2015). In determining whether a
defendant's use is a fair one, courts weigh (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work,
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and (4) the effect of the use upon the market for or value of the work
in light of the purposes of the Copyright Act. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569 , 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127
L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) .

A. The Purpose and Character of the Use

To evaluate the purpose and character of the use, the Court considers whether the use is commercial, whether the use is
ransformative, and whether there is evidence of bad faith. Id.

On the one hand, the use here is commercial. The ""crux"" of the distinction between commercial and noncommercial use is
whether ""the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price."" Harper &
Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. _ 471 U.S. 539 , 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . The more commercial
he use, the more likely the first factor weighs against fair use. However, a challenged use is not ""presumptively unfair""
because it is profit driven. Campbell . 510 U.S. at 594 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . For instance, ""[a]lmost all newspapers, books and
magazines are published by commercial enterprises that seek a profit,” yet news reporting is specifically enumerated under
§ 107 as an example of a fair use of a copyrighted work. Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. Gen. Signal Corp. . 724
F.2d 1044 , 1049 (2d Cir. 1983) ;see also Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 561 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 .

The Sinclair Defendants operate for-profit news stations and websites that stood to profit from the web traffic the polar bear
video attracted. News outlets often license photos and videos to illustrate and add visual interest to their articles -- but here,
the Sinclair Defendants have not paid the licensing fee. The use is therefore commercial.

On the other hand, the use here may well be transformative. A transformative use alters the purpose and context of the
copyrighted work with ""new expression, meaning, or message. See Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. , — U.S. ,141S.
Ct. 1183 , 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021) (quoting Campbell ,_ 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). ""In the context of news reporting
... the need to convey information to the public accurately may in some instances make it desirable and consonant with
copyright law for a defendant to faithfully reproduce an original work without alteration.""

[551 F.Supp.3d 197]

Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. , 756 F.3d 73, 84 (2d Cir. 2014). For example, ""a news report about a
video that has gone viral on the Internet might fairly display a screenshot or clip from that video to illustrate what all the fuss
is about,"" thereby ""transforming the function of the work in the new context."" Barcroft Media, Ltd. v. Coed Media Grp., LLC ,
297 F. Supp. 3d 339, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2017).

The original purpose and meaning of the work was likely to highlight the cruel effects of climate change on the polar bear
population and to inspire the audience to donate to or work with SeaLegacy, a conservation group founded by Nicklen. See
SAC § 2. The Sinclair Defendants’ use focused on the Video's popularity. The article stresses that the Video went ""viral"" and
that the accompanying photograph was ""grabbing attention,"" relies on National Geographic reporting to describe the
circumstances under which the Video was made, and then adds that the ""video has already reached over 1 million views.""
SAC, Ex. 8. The Sinclair Defendants did not use the Video to illustrate an independent story about polar bears or
environmentalism; instead, the Sinclair Defendants ""report[ed] news about the Images themselves ."" See Barcroft , 297 F.
Supp. 3d at 352 (emphasis in original); BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, Inc. , 196 F. Supp. 3d 395, 406 n.6
(S.D.N.Y. 2016) (distinguishing fair use cases in which ""the fact of the photograph"" is the story from unfair uses in which the



--- Page 5 ---
contents of the photograph are used as illustration). Because ""the use of a copyrighted photograph in a news article can
properly be deemed transformative where the photograph itself is the subject of the story,"" the first factor weighs in favor of
fair use. See McGucken v. Newsweek LLC , 464 F. Supp. 3d 594, 606 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), reconsideration denied, 2020 WL
6135733 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2020).

Finally, there is no indication of bad faith. Though the Sinclair Defendants did not request a license despite the availability of
licensing information in Nicklen's Instagram post, the Second Circuit is ""aware of no controlling authority to the effect that
the failure to seek permission for copying, in itself, constitutes bad faith."" Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 256 (2d Cir.
2006).

B. The Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The nature of the copyrighted work is ""rarely found to be determinative,"" and this case is no exception. On Davis v. The Gap
Inc. , 246 F.3d 152, 175 (2d Cir.2001). Copyright law recognizes that creative or expressive works are closer to the ""core""
of intended copyright protection, while factual or previously published works are entitled to thinner copyright protection.
Campbell . 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; Blanch at 256. Nicklen's videography reflects his artistic choices of camera
angle, exposure settings, and video length, among other things. Simultaneously, the work purports to depict reality and was
made publicly available before the challenged use. It is arguable whether the Video was created for ""news-gathering or non-
artistic purposes"" or whether it was intended to express a point of view. See N. Jersey Media Grp. Inc. v. Pirro , 74 F. Supp.
3d 605, 620 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). This factor does not weigh strongly for or against fair use.

C. The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

By analyzing ""the amount and substantiality of the original work used by the secondary user, we gain insight into the
purpose and character of the use as we consider whether the quantity of the material

[551 F.Supp.3d 198]

used was ‘reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.’ ""Am. Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc. , 60 F.3d 913, 926
(2d Cir. 1994).

This factor weighs against a finding of fair use because the Sinclair Defendants embedded the entire Video on their
websites. Though the Sinclair Defendants respond that it was necessary to show the entire video to fulfill their news
purpose, the Sinclair Defendants could have conveyed the Video's virality by providing a screenshot of the number of likes
or views the Video received. In the alternative, a single image of the emaciated bear rather than an embedded copy of the
full work could have conveyed that the Video was shocking or heart-wrenching enough to grab the Internet's attention.
Because the Sinclair Defendants reproduced the heart of the work, this factor weighs against fair use.

D. The Effect of the Use on the Market

When a defendant ""offer[s] a market substitute for the original,"" its use is not fair. NXIVM Corp. v. Ross Inst. , 364 F.3d 471,
481 (2d Cir. 2004). ""[T]he more the copying is done to achieve a purpose that differs from the purpose of the original, the
less likely it is that the copy will serve as a satisfactory substitute for the original."" Authors Guild . 804 F.3d at 223 . When
analyzing the effect of the infringing use on the market for a copyrighted work, courts ask ""whether, if the challenged use
becomes widespread, it will adversely affect the potential market for"" the work. Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley
Lid. . 448 F.3d 605 , 613 (2d Cir. 2006). The market for licensing photographs and videos to media outlets is a ""traditional,
reasonable"" market of the sort courts consider in this analysis. See, e.g. , Ferdman v. CBS Interactive Inc. , 342 F. Supp. 3d
515, 541 (S.D.N.Y. 2018).

A news article about a viral video is unlikely to threaten to ""deprive the rights holder of significant revenues because of the
likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original."" See Authors Guild , 804 F.3d
at 223 ; see also Walsh v. Townsquare Media, Inc. , 464 F. Supp. 3d 570, 586 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (finding no harm to the
licensing market where a photograph appeared as part of a post alongside text and other images). Because a news article
recontextualizes a work and serves a different purpose, it is unlikely that someone who wanted to purchase the work would
find reviewing the news article an adequate substitute.

However, the Sinclair Defendants’ use of the copyrighted video, if widespread, would harm the licensing market for Nicklen's
video. There would be no need for news outlets to license the video at all if each outlet could, without Nicklen's prior
authorization, embed the video from Instagram or Facebook. Unlike a parodic use, widespread adoption of the Sinclair
Defendants’ use could overtake the market for Nicklen's video. Accepting as true Nicklen's allegations that he licensed the
Video to ""almost two dozen entities both in the United States and throughout the world,"" SAC § 152, this factor weighs
against fair use.

E. Conclusion

The Sinclair Defendants’ fair use affirmative defense cannot be resolved at this stage. The fair use inquiry is a ""fact-driven,""
""context-sensitive"" consideration of the nature and purpose of the challenged use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the
amount used, and the potential harm to the market for the copyrighted work.

[551 F.Supp.3d 199]

Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 704-05 (2d Cir. 2013). Thus, granting a motion to dismiss on fair use grounds is rareSee
id. ; Graham v. Prince , 265 F. Supp. 3d 366, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (pointing out that courts ""generally do not address the fair
use defense until the summary judgment stage"" and even then are wary of granting summary judgment); BWP Media USA.
Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, LLC , 87 F. Supp. 3d 499, 505 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (observing the ""dearth of cases granting such a
motion""); Hirsch v. CBS Broadcasting, Inc. , 2017 WL 3393845, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2017) (noting that resolving fair use
on a motion to dismiss is ""uncommon""). To be sure, the pleadings alone could establish fair use in an appropriate case. See
TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 839 F.3d 168 , 178 (2d Cir. 2016) (""[T]his court has acknowledged the possibility of fair
use being so clearly established by a complaint as to support dismissal of a copyright infringement claim.""); Cariou . 714
F.3d at 707 . But this is not the rare case in which the Court can make a fair use determination simply by comparing the two
works, such that ""discovery would not provide additional relevant information."" See Arrow Productions, Ltd. v. Weinstein Co.
, 44 F. Supp. 3d. 359, 368 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).

Where ""the fair use inquiry does not turn on visual differences,"" but rather on whether the work is factual or artistic, whether
the challenged use is classified as transformative ""news reporting,"" or whether the use affected the licensing market for the
work, the copies of the work attached to the Complaint ""do not contain enough factual content to enable a solid
assessment."" Hirsch , 2017 WL 3393845, at *7. Such is the case here. Because the Court's fair use analysis would benefit
from a better-developed factual record, the Court denies the motion to dismiss.

CONCLUSION

The Court hereby denies the motion to dismiss, because Nicklen has stated a prima facie case for copyright infringement
and because the Sinclair Defendants have not met their difficult burden of proving a fair use defense on the sheer basis of
the pleadings.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:

1Co-plaintiff Christina Mittermeier, a photographer who took a still photograph of the same polar bear that was also widely embedded on online news
sites, does not allege that the Sinclair Defendants embedded her photo. See SAC {J 277-78. As such, the Court does not discuss factual allegations
and claims relevant only to Mittermeier.

MEMORANDUM & ORDER

NICHOLAS G. GARAUFIS, United States District Judge.

In February 2019, a representative for Defendant Michael Grecco and his associated
[524 F.Supp.3d 58]

co-Defendant business entities contacted Plaintiff Lee Golden III to inform him that a July 2015 post on Golden's blog
contained a copyrighted image that he did not have a license to use. The image was a 1998 portrait of the actress Lucy
Lawless in her iconic 1990s titular role as Xena: Warrior Princess (the ""Xena Photograph""). In anticipation of a lawsuit for
copyright infringement, Golden filed this action, seeking a Declaratory Judgment stating that his use of the image was not
copyright infringement under the Fair Use Doctrine. Grecco answered and asserted a counterclaim for copyright
infringement, to which Golden asserted 15 affirmative defenses. Now before the court is Grecco's Motion for Summary
Judgment on Golden's original claim and his counterclaim. ( See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (""Mem."") (Dkt.
25); Pl.’s Mem. in Opp. (""Opp."") (Dkt. 26); Defs.’ Reply (""Reply"") (Dkt. 27).) For the following reasons, Grecco's motion is
GRANTED. The court awards Defendant $750 in statutory damages, the minimum allowable under the Copyright Act, and
declines to award attorneys’ fees or costs. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 504(c)(2), 505.

|. BACKGROUND |

Michael Grecco is a successful photographer whose work has appeared frequently in popular media. ( See Defs.’ Local R.
56.1 Statement (""56.1"") (Dkt. 25-1) 4 1.) In 1997, he travelled to New Zealand for a photoshoot for the television show Xena:
Warrior Princess , for which MCA Television Group paid him $25,000. ( /d. 3-4.) Grecco retained all copyrights to the
photographs from the shoot, including the Xena Photograph. ( /d. 4 8.) He subsequently transferred the copyrights to
Michael Grecco Photography, Inc., which changed its name to Michael Grecco Productions, Inc. in 2012. ( Id. {§ 9-10, 17.) 2
Since 2009, many of Grecco's photographs have been available to license through Getty Images, including the Xena
Photograph. ( /d. J 12.) Golden claims, based on information produced during discovery, that the Xena Photograph was
licensed 11 times between 2010 and 2013, generating a total of $3.94 in revenue for Grecco, and has not been licensed
since. ( See Opp. at 12; Decl. of Yevgeny Strupinsky (Dkt. 26-3) Ex. 1 at ECF p. 5.) Grecco insists that is an ""erroneous
interpretation of the licensing spreadsheet provided in discovery,"" but declines to provide the correct amount, claiming that
the licensing fee is irrelevant to the case at bar. ( See Reply at 3.) The United States Copyright Office issued a registration
for a group of Grecco's photographs, including the Xena Photograph, on July 7, 2010. ( /d. 4 15-16.)

Lee Golden III is the owner and operator of the pop culture blog www.filmcombatsyndicate.com. (56.1 § 20.) In 2015,
Golden published a blogpost about a rumored

[524 F.Supp.3d 59]

reboot of the 1990s television series Xena: Warrior Princess with the title, ""The XENA Series Reboot Was Happening. Then
It Wasn't, But Now It Is ... Is It?"". (Decl. of Lee Golden III (""Golden Decl."") (Dkt. 26-2) 4 7; 56.1 4 21.) Along with the
blogpost, Golden posted an image of Lucy Lawless as Xena; specifically, he posted Grecco's Xena Photograph. ( See
Blogpost (Dkt. 25-2) at ECF p. 54.) Golden found the picture by searching the social media platform Tumblr and avers that
he believed it was ""a free, promotional photograph of Xena on Tumbler [sic] posted with permission and free to use.""
(Golden Decl. ff 8-10.) Golden's website earns money by displaying banner ads and is paid per click on its articles;
however, he asserts that he never earned any money from the Xena post and submits evidence to show that the post


--- Page 2 ---
earned no money from July 2018 until it was taken down. ( /d. J 11-13.)

On October 5, 2018, Grecco discovered Golden's blogpost, which was more than three years old. (56.1 § 21.) 3In February
2019, Grecco's counsel contacted Golden, alleging that he was unlawfully displaying a copyrighted image. (Golden Decl. 4
14.) Golden immediately responded to apologize and to say that he did not know the material was copyrighted. ( See Feb.
13, 2019 Email of Lee Golden (Dkt. 26-2) at ECF p. 10.) Golden took down the blogpost upon receiving the notice. (Golden
Decl. J 14.) Despite the apology and removal, on April 29, 2019, Grecco's attorney wrote Golden to say that he was liable for
up to $150,000 for his infringement, but that Grecco would accept a $25,000 settlement. ( See April 29, 2019 Letter (Dkt. 26-
2) at ECF p. 13.) Grecco's attorney also included a draft complaint that he threatened to file in the United States District
Court in Los Angeles if Golden failed to meet the settlement demand. ( /d. ) Rather than face costly litigation in California,
Golden filed this case, seeking a declaration that he did not violate Grecco's copyright, or in the alternative, that he was
liable for either no compensatory damages or significantly reduced statutory damages because he was an innocent infringer.
( See Compl. (Dkt. 1) § 1.) Grecco then asserted a single counterclaim for copyright infringement. ( See Arts. and Amend.
Counterclaim (Dkt. 12).)

Il. LEGAL STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate when ""the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the
movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(a). ""The role of the court is not to resolve disputed
issues of fact but to assess whether there are any factual issues to be tried. In determining whether summary judgment is
appropriate, this court will construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve all
ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant."" Brod v. Omya, Inc. , 653 F.3d 156 , 164 (2d Cir. 2011).
4""A ‘material’ fact is one capable of influencing the case's outcome under governing substantive law, and a ‘genuine’ dispute

317 , 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) ). While the court must draw all inferences in favor of the non-movant,
the non-movant ""may not rely on mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for
summary judgment."" Fletcher v. Atex, Inc. . 68 F.3d 1451 , 1456 (2d Cir. 1995).

Ill. DISCUSSION

For ease of analysis, the court first considers Grecco's counter-claim for copyright infringement, followed by Golden's fair
use defense and other affirmative defenses.

A. Copyright Infringement

""To establish [copyright] infringement two elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of
constituent elements of the work that are original.""_Feist Publ'ns. Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. _ 499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct.
1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) .

Ownership is not at issue here, because Golden admits that Grecco has produced a valid copyright registration for the Xena
Photograph. (56.1 | 16; Pl.’s 56.1 Resp. (Dkt. 26-1) § 16.) See Scholz Design, Inc. v. Sard Custom Homes, LLC , 691 F.3d
182 , 186 (2d Cir. 2012) (""A certificate of copyright registration is prima facie evidence of ownership of a valid copyright, but
the alleged infringer may rebut that presumption."").

Grecco has also met the second prong for ""originality"" because the Xena Photograph is clearly an example of portrait
photography, reflecting the artistic choices of Grecco, its author. See 17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(5) (extending copyright protection
to ""pictorial"" and ""graphic"" works of authorship); see also Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony , 111 U.S. 53 , 60,4 S.Ct.
279 , 28 L.Ed. 349 (1884) (holding that a photographic portrait of Oscar Wilde was ""an original work of art, the product of
[the photographer's] intellectual invention, of which [the photographer] is the author, and of a class of inventions for which
the constitution intended that congress should secure to him the exclusive right to use, publish, and sell, as it has done by
[statute].""). Grecco has therefore demonstrated that he is entitled to summary judgment on his counterclaim for copyright
infringement, subject to Golden's affirmative defenses, considered below.

B. Fair Use

Golden's primary defense, asserted in his Complaint and in his affirmative defenses to Grecco's counterclaim ( see Ans. to
Counterclaim (Dkt. 15)), is that his blogpost constituted a fair use of the copyrighted image and is therefore not infringement
under 17 U.S.C. § 107.

The purpose of copyright law is ""[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,"" U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8, and


--- Page 3 ---
""expand public knowledge and understanding ... by giving potential creators exclusive control over copying of their works,
thus giving them a financial incentive to create informative, intellectually enriching works for public consumption."" Authors
Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 212 (2d Cir. 2015). There are limits, however, on creators’ control over their work,
including the doctrine of fair use. See

[524 F.Supp.3d 61]

Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. , 756 F.3d 73 , 81 (2d Cir. 2014) (""Because copyright law recognizes the
need for breathing space, however, a defendant who otherwise would have violated one or more of these exclusive rights
may avoid liability if he can establish that he made fair use of the copyrighted material."").

""[T]he fair use determination is an open-ended and context sensitive inquiry,"" in which the court weighs four non-exclusive
statutory factors in light of the purposes of copyright.Cariou v. Prince . 714 F.3d 694 , 705 (2d Cir. 2013). Those factors are:
(1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and substantiality of the
portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market or value
of copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107. The party seeking a fair use determination need not demonstrate that every factor
weighs in its favor. See Cariou_, 714 F.3d at 705 . Rather, “all factors are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in
light of the purposes of copyright."" Swatch__756 F.3d at 81 (quoting_Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. 510 U.S. 569 , 578,
114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ). The determination of ""fair use is a mixed question of law and fact,"" Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. , 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) , and the Second Circuit has
repeatedly ""resolved fair use determinations at the summary judgment stage where there are no genuine issues of material
fact,""_Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 250 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Castle Rock Ent., Inc. v. Carol Pub. Grp., Inc. , 150 F.3d
132 , 137 (2d Cir. 1998) ).

1. Purpose and Character of the Work

The first fair use factor is ""the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is
for nonprofit educational purposes."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). This factor, which has been described as ""[t]he heart of the fair use
inquiry,"" On Davis v. The Gap, Inc. , 246 F.3d 152 , 174 (2d Cir. 2001), seeks to determine ""whether and to what extent the
work is transformative."" Campbell__510 U. S. Reports 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Whether a work is transformative depends on
the extent to which it ""merely ‘supersedes the objects’ of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further
purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message."" /d. (quoting Folsom v. Marsh , 9
F.Cas. 342, 348 (C.C.D. Mass. 1841) (Story, J.)); see also Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard , 103 Harv. L. Rev.
1105, 1111 (1990). With regard to photographs, ""[u]sing a photo for the precise reason it was created does not support a
finding that the nature and purpose of the use was fair."" BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, Inc. , 196 F. Supp. 3d
395, 407 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).

Golden argues that because he took a promotional commercial photograph that was intended to promote the original Xena:
Warrior Princess television show and repurposed it in a blogpost commenting on a possible future reboot of the show, his
use of the photograph was transformative. ( See Opp. at 6-8.) That is unpersuasive. As this court recently held, although the
Copyright Act, at 17 U.S.C. § 107, cites ""news reporting"" as one method of fair use, ""the promise of copyright would be an
empty one if it could be avoided merely by dubbing the infringement a fair use ‘news report.’ "" Cruz v. Cox Media Grp., LLC ,
444 F. Supp. 3d 457, 467 (E.D.N.Y. 2020) (quoting Harper & Row. 471 U. S. Reports 557, 105 S.Ct. 2218 ). Like the
infringing defendant in Cruz , Golden ""used the Photograph as an illustrative

[524 F.Supp.3d 62]

aid because it depicted the subjects described in the Article,"" not because the image itself served an important public
purpose or disseminated important information. Cruz , 444 F. Supp. 3d at 468 (distinguishing Swatch__756 F.3d at 82 ).
""Display of a copyrighted image or video may be transformative where the use serves to illustrate criticism, commentary, or
a news story about that work."" Barcroft Media, Ltd. v. Coed Media Grp., LLC , 297 F. Supp. 3d 339, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2017)
(emphasis in original). That situation is distinct from an author who lifts someone else's copyrighted material because it
provides an attractive image to go along with the story he is reporting.

Recognizing that the news reporting cases are not in his favor, Golden instead tries to analogize his case to_Bill Graham
Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. , 448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 2006) . In that case, the Second Circuit held that the publisher of
a 480-page coffee table book about the cultural history of the Grateful Dead was not liable for infringement for including
copyrighted images from the band's history, such as concert posters, in the book. /d. at 608-610. Noting that ""courts have
frequently afforded fair use protection to the use of copyrighted material in biographies, recognizing such works as forms of
historic scholarship, criticism, and comment that require incorporation of original source material for optimum treatment of
their subjects,"" the court determined that the book served the ""transformative purpose of enhancing the biographical
information ..., a purpose separate and distinct from the original artistic and promotional purpose for which the images were
created."" /d. at 610. But Golden's post was not a work of history, scholarship, or criticism; it was news reporting about
rumors regarding a television show's revival. His blogpost did not transform the purpose of the material from promotion to
historical artifact; it appropriated the image to illustrate the subject of his reporting.



--- Page 4 ---
Because Golden's use of the image was not transformative, the first factor weighs against a finding of fair use.
2. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second factor looks to the nature of the copyrighted work and acknowledges that ""some works are closer to the core of
intended copyright protection than others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former
works are copied."" Campbell, 510 U. S. Reports 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164. A portrait photograph that is the clear product of the
photographer's artistic choices, like the Xena Photograph, falls close to the core of copyright protection. See, e.g. Burrow-
Giles_111 U. S. Reports 54-55 , 4 S.Ct. 279 .5Thus, this factor cuts heavily in Grecco's favor.

3. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used in Relation to the Copyrighted Work as a Whole

The third factor considers whether ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a
whole ... are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.""

[524 F.Supp.3d 63]

Campbell__510 U. S. Reports 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Generally speaking, ""the more of a copyrighted work that is taken, the
less likely the use is to be fair."" Infinity Broad. Corp. v. Kirkwood , 150 F.3d 104 , 109 (2d Cir. 1998). Because Golden used
the entire image, unaltered, this factor clearly favors Grecco.

4. Effect of the Use on the Potential Market

The final fair use factor considers ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" 17
U.S.C. § 107(4). This factor requires the court to investigate whether infringement will affect a ""traditional, reasonable, or
likely to be developed market."" Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 614 . This factor is ""concerned with secondary uses that,
by offering a substitute for the original, usurp a market that properly belongs to the copyright-holder."" /nfinity Broad. Corp...
150 F.3d at 110 ; see also Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 566 -67 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (""Fair use, when properly applied, is
limited to copying by others which does not materially impair the marketability of the work which is copied."")

The Xena Photograph was licensed 11 times between 2009 and 2013, generating $3.94 in fees for Grecco, and has not
been licensed since. (56.1 § 14; Opp. at 12.) Thus, Golden is correct that when he posted the photograph to his blog in
2015, he is unlikely to have dealt Grecco any compensable damage. ( See Opp. at 12.) On the other hand, Grecco is
certainly correct that allowing websites to post copyrighted material without a license merely because the market for the
material has gone cold would pose a substantial threat to the licensing market in general. ( See Mem. at 13.)

In a fair use analysis, the court must weigh the factors ""in light of the purposes of copyright."" Campbell__ 510 U. S. Reports
578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164. Golden's defense that Grecco likely did not lose money as a result of his infringement does not
adequately address the broader policy concerns that the court must weigh. As the Supreme Court has stated with regard to
an earlier version of the Copyright Act, ""a rule of liability which merely takes away the profits from an infringement would
offer little discouragement to infringers. It would fall short of an effective sanction for enforcement of the copyright policy."" F.
W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts . 344 U.S. 228 , 233,73 S.Ct. 222 , 97 L.Ed. 276 (1952) . As discussed below, the
Copyright Act permits a copyright owner to elect to pursue statutory damages in excess of actual damages, even when
actual damages are provable. See 17 U.S.C. § 504(c). The parties in this case dispute whether the damages should be 50
times or 190 times the total that Grecco has ever received in licensing fees for the Xena Photograph, should the court find
infringement, exemplifying that the purpose of the Copyright Act's remedial scheme goes beyond any individual copyright
holder's injury. 2 See, e.g. Fitzgerald Pub. Co. v. Baylor Pub. Co. , 807 F.2d 1110 , 1117 (2d Cir. 1986) (citing ""deterrent
effect"" as a factor in ""deciding upon the appropriate statutory damages award""). In sum, the statute and caselaw require the
court to consider more than merely the effect of Golden's

[524 F.Supp.3d 64]

infringement on Grecco. The court must also weigh the effect on the market in general to allow a fair use defense on the
basis that the copyright holder was unlikely to have suffered actual damages based on the status of the market for the
copyrighted material at issue. See Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 568, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (""[T]o negate fair use one need
only show that if the challenged use ‘should become widespread, it would adversely affect the potential market for the
copyrighted work.’ "") (quoting Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios Inc. , 464 U.S. 417 , 451,104 S.Ct. 774 , 78
L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) ); see also Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 258 (2d Cir. 2006) (""In considering the fourth factor, our
concern is not whether the secondary use suppresses or even destroys the market for the original work or its potential
derivatives, but whether the secondary use usurps the market of the original work.""). At bottom, Grecco was paid
handsomely to produce the original photograph to promote the television show in 1997. He retained the copyright to that
image so that he could license it, for a fee, for secondary use. That secondary market would be meaningless if entertainment
websites could use the image without paying the licensing fee, even if few or no customers showed interest in the Xena
Photograph by 2015. In light of those broader copyright policy concerns, the fourth factor favors Grecco and counsels
against a finding of fair use.

All told, three of the four fair use factors cut decisively in Grecco's favor. The fourth factor also favors Grecco. Taken


--- Page 5 ---
together, Golden's infringing use of Grecco's copyright was not fair use.
C. Remaining Affirmative Defenses

In his initial response to Grecco's counterclaim, Golden raised 15 affirmative defenses. ( See Ans. to Counterclaim at 4-5.)
Of those, he abandoned seven in his brief opposing summary judgment. In addition, one of the remaining defenses centered
on the fair use doctrine, discussed above. Seven affirmative defenses remain: implied license, public domain, de minimis
infringement, unclean hands, damages from Grecco's own conduct, damages for the conduct of third parties, and lack of
profits.

A moving party who ""uses a summary judgment motion, in part, to challenge the legal sufficiency of an affirmative defense—
on which the [non-moving party] bears the burden of proof at trial\—{ ] may satisfy its Rule 56 burden by showing that there is
an absence of evidence to support an essential element of the non-moving party's case."" Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v.
Giammettei , 34 F.3d 51 , 54 (2d Cir. 1994). Golden bears the burden of producing sufficient evidence to support his
affirmative defenses; insofar as he argues, for example, that ""the absence of any facts ... [indicating] that there was not an
implied license creates a dispute of material facts,"" he is wrong. (Opp. at 19-20.)

Implied License. Courts find ""implied licenses only in narrow circumstances where one party created a work at the other's
request and handed it over, intending that the other copy and distribute it."" SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare, L.P.

v. Watson Pharm., Inc. , 211 F.3d 21 , 25 (2d Cir. 2000). Golden offers no evidence that speaks to those elements, apart
from his assertion that he did not believe he needed a license to use the photograph. (Opp. at 19-20.) He has failed to meet
his burden on this defense.

Public Domain. A copyrighted work is ""not yet in the public domain."" Eldred v. Ashcroft , 537 U.S. 186 , 213, 123 S.Ct. 769 ,
154 L.Ed.2d 683 (2003) . For instance, a copyrighted work created after

[524 F.Supp.3d 65]

January 1, 1978 ""endures for a term consisting of the life of the author and 70 years after the author's death"" before it enters
the public domain. 17 U.S.C. § 302(a). Grecco holds a valid copyright for the Xena Photograph, so it is not in the public
domain, and this affirmative defense fails.

De Minimis Use. Golden has confused "" de minimis use,"" which refers to the amount of the copyrighted material used in the
offending work, with de minimis damages, which is not a defense to copyright infringement. See On Davis_. 246 F.3d at 172
(""The de minimis doctrine essentially provides that where unauthorized copying is sufficiently trivial, the law will not impose

legal consequences.""); id. at 158 (""The existence of damages suffered is not an essential element of a claim for copyright
infringement.""). Because Golden used the Xena Photograph unaltered and in its entirety, he cannot claim that his use was

de minimis.

Unclean Hands. The unclean hands doctrine ""closes the doors of a court of equity to one tainted with inequitableness or
bad faith relative to the matter in which he seeks relief."" Motorola Credit Corp. v. Uzan , 561 F.3d 123 , 129 (2d Cir. 2009).
To be sure, Grecco and his attorneys have pursued this action aggressively and have continued to press litigation, even
though Golden immediately took down the offending content upon notice. The court also notes that this team's conduct has
led another court to suggest that Grecco's counsel might be considered a ""copyright troll,"" a term that refers to someone who
scours the internet for unlicensed use of copyrighted material for the purpose of extracting settlements. See Werner v.
Complex Media, Inc. , No. 19-cv-10094 (DLC), 2020 WL 1435180 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2020) ; see also McDermott v.
Monday Monday, LLC , No. 17-cv-9230 (DLC), 2018 WL 1033240 at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2018). Whether the proliferation
of images on the internet, along with emergence of reverse image-searching technology, has spawned a copyright litigation
industry in need of reform is a topic worthy of consideration. See, e.g., Shyamkrishna Balganesh, The Uneasy Case Against
Copyright Trolls , 86 S. Cal. L. Rev. 723, 769 (2013). However, if every copyright case were litigated through a Rule 56
summary judgment motion, copyright trolling would not likely be ""a strain on the Court's time and resources,"" as Judge
Denise Cote chided while noting how many cases counsel had filed in the Southern District of New York without a merits-
based decision. 8 Werner , 2020 WL 1435180 at *2. Even if Golden's aspersions about Grecco's counsel have merit in the
context of other litigation, those cases are not before the court. Golden may be a sympathetic copyright infringer and Grecco
a litigious and opportunistic copyright holder, but that is not a basis for an ""unclean hands"" defense in this case.

Damages from Grecco's Own Conduct. |In support of his next affirmative defense, Golden argues that Grecco and his co-
defendant entities ""could have put their own photograph into the public domain or allowed it to exist, and ceased using
copyright to advance arts and sciences and uses it now for litigation. As a result, they have caused any and all damages that
they may have suffered — which, Plaintiff posits, is none."" (Opp. at 21.) Again, damages are not an essential element of a
claim for copyright infringement. Moreover, to the extent Golden is suggesting that as a policy matter Grecco bears

[524 F.Supp.3d 66]

fault for retaining the copyright to the Xena Photograph, rather than releasing it into the public domain, his argument is
contradicted by the very purpose of copyright law. Accordingly, this is no defense to Grecco's counterclaim.


--- Page 6 ---
Damages for the Conduct of Third Parties. Next, Golden suggests that because he found the image on the internet, it is
possible that a licensee ""could have placed this photograph into the public domain, sublicensed it to a third-party who put it
on Tumblr, or any number of possible scenarios."" (Opp. at 22.) Leaving aside that it is Golden's burden to proffer evidence
to support an affirmative defense, a licensee would not be able to put Grecco's copyrighted image into the public domain.
Likewise, even if Golden could prove that he had obtained the image from another infringing use, that would not be a
defense to Golden's own subsequent infringement.

Lack of Profits. Finally, Golden argues that because Grecco could hypothetically seek compensatory damages, he can
assert a lack of profits from the infringement as an affirmative defense. (Opp. at 22.) If Grecco were to seek compensatory
damages, he would need to offer proof of his losses, which Golden would have a chance to rebut. This argument is
improperly framed as an affirmative defense.

Golden has not met his burden with regard to any of the seven remaining affirmative defenses, and thus, Grecco is entitled
to summary judgment in favor of his counterclaim for copyright infringement.

D. Remedies
1. Statutory Damages

Under the Copyright Act, a copyright owner may elect to recover either actual, compensatory damages or statutory

damages as a remedy for infringement. 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1). When a copyright holder seeks statutory damages, the court
has ""wide discretion"" to set an award between a statutory minimum of $750 and a statutory maximum of $30,000 per
infringed work. Id. ; see Fitzgerald Pub. Co. v. Baylor Pub. Co. , 807 F.2d 1110 , 1116 (2d Cir. 1986). If the infringement was
willful, the statutory maximum increases to $150,000. 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2). In contrast, if the infringement was ""innocent,""
the statutory minimum decreases to $200. /d. ; see Bryant v. Media Right Prods. , 603 F.3d 135 , 139 (2d Cir. 2010). A
copyright holder bears the burden to prove willfulness; an infringer bears the burden to prove innocence. Bryant, 603 F.3d at
143 . Golden argues that he is, at most, an innocent infringer and that the statutory damages award should not exceed
$200. (Opp. at 17-18.) Grecco counters that Golden has not met his burden to show that he is an innocent infringer and asks
the court to award $750. (Reply at 4-5.)

An innocent infringer must demonstrate ""both (1) a subjective good faith belief that his conduct was innocent, and (2) that his
belief was objectively reasonable under the circumstances."" Marshall v. Marshall , 08-cv-1420 (LB), 2012 WL 1079550
(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2012) (quoting_Childress v. Taylor, 798 F. Supp. 981 , 994 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) ). ""The mere absence of a
copyright mark is not sufficient to establish innocent infringement ... if the defendant had reason to believe the goods were
copyrighted and unlicensed.""_D.C. Comics Inc. v. Mini Gift Shop _ 912 F.2d 29 , 35 (2d Cir. 1990) ;see also BMG Music v.
Gonzalez, 430 F.3d 888 , 892 (7th Cir. 2005) (holding that to determine ""innocence"" under Section 504(c)(2), the relevant
question is whether the infringer ""had access"" to works bearing proper copyright notice, not whether the work at issue bore
those notices). In the context of images found through internet searches, courts

[524 F.Supp.3d 67]

have held that the lack of a copyright notice alongside the copied image is not sufficient to show innocence where

""information that a copyright existed was readily discoverable."" Reed v. Ezelle Inv. Props. , 353 F. Supp. 3d 1025, 1037 (D.
Or. 2018).

Golden is not an innocent infringer because it was not objectively reasonable under the circumstances to believe that the
Xena Photograph was free for any person on the internet to copy and repurpose. Golden avers that he believed that the
image he found on Tumblr was ""a promotional photograph,"" that was posted ""with permission and was free to use."" (Golden
Decl. {{ 9-10.) He offers no evidence beyond those statements. Accepting Golden's argument would lead courts to apply
lower statutory damages to any layperson's use of the many copyrighted images available on the internet without notice of
their copyrighted status. Moreover, Golden's claim that he believed the Xena Photograph was ""promotional"" cuts against his
argument, because a ""promotional"" photograph is, by definition, a commercial image. The mere fact that Golden found an
image on Tumblr does not qualify him as an ""innocent"" infringer, especially when he believed the image was promotional,
and he is the proprietor of a website about the entertainment industry. Therefore, $750 is the proper statutory damages
award under the Copyright Act.

2. Attorney's Fees and Costs

In addition to damages, Grecco wishes to seek attorney's fees and costs. In copyright cases, ""attorney's fees are to be
awarded to prevailing parties only as a matter of the court's discretion,"" pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 505._Fogerty v. Fantasy. Inc.
510 U.S. 517 , 534,114 S.Ct. 1023 , 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994) . The court may consider a number of nonexclusive factors
as part of the determination, such as ""frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual and in the
legal components of the case) and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and
deterrence."" /d. n.19. Those factors ""guide courts’ discretion, so long as [they] are faithful to the purposes of the Copyright
Act and are applied to prevailing plaintiffs and defendants in an evenhanded manner."" /d. The Copyright Act authorizes
copyright holders to pursue statutory damages to protect intellectual property and, ultimately, to encourage the production of
publicly available creative work. See id. ; Sony, 464 U. S. Reports 429, 104 S.Ct. 774 . Because Golden has acted in good
faith, immediately removed the offending post upon notice, and likely caused little or no actual damages, a statutory



--- Page 7 ---
damages award in Grecco's favor is more than sufficient to advance the purposes of the Copyright Act. Accordingly,
attorney's fees and costs are not warranted.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated, Defendant Michael Grecco Productions, Inc.’s motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff Lee
Golden III's claim for declaratory relief, and as to its counterclaim for copyright infringement, is GRANTED. Defendant is
awarded $750 in statutory damages. Plaintiff's claims are DISMISSED as to the other defendants. The Clerk of the Court is
respectfully DIRECTED to enter a judgment for Defendant and to close the case.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:

1The court constructs the following statement of facts from the parties’ Local Rule 56.1 Statements and the admissible evidence they submitted. Except
where otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed. Where the parties allege different facts, the court notes the dispute and credits the Plaintiff's
version if it is supported by evidence in the record. All evidence is construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party with all ""reasonable
inferences"" drawn in its favor. ING Bank N.V. v. M/V TEMARA, IMO No. 9333929 , 892 F.3d 511 , 518 (2d Cir. 2018).

2 Golden concedes that Grecco's business entities are the relevant copyright holders and that any claims against Michael Grecco as an individual should
be dismissed. ( See Opp. at 5.) The relevant party in this litigation is Michael Grecco Productions, Inc. For the sake of simplicity, the court uses ""Grecco""
to refer both to the individual and to his incorporated entity.

3 When Grecco discovered the post, the publication date was listed as July 8, 2018, which is the date when filmcombatsyndicate.com switched its
webhosting service. ( See 56.1 § 22; Golden Decl. 4 11.)

4When quoting cases, and unless otherwise noted, all citations and quotation marks are omitted, and all alterations are adopted.

8 Golden writes that ""we leave it to the Court to compare the picture of Oscar Wilde [at issue in Burrow-Giles ] to the picture of Xena,"" before concluding
that the Wilde portrait ""is high art: striking, deliberate, and narrative"" whereas the Xena Photograph ""is a headshot against a white background."" (Opp. at
10.) The court will not evaluate the comparative artistic merit of two portraits. Indeed, there may be no starker example of the threat that judicial scrutiny
can pose to artistic expression than the story of Oscar Wilde. See Martha M. Ertman, Oscar Wilde: Paradoxical Poster Child for Both Identity and Post-
Identity , 25 L. & Soc. Ing. 153 (2000).

& As mentioned above, Grecco disputes this figure but offers nothing to rebut Golden's interpretation of the data which was produced during discovery.

2Grecco has received $3.94 in licensing fees for the photograph. Golden argues that, if the court finds infringement, it should award $200 in statutory
damages. (Opp. at 17-18.) Grecco argues that the court should award $750. (Mem. at 24.)

8 Of course, if every ""troll"" lawsuit were litigated through summary judgment to recover $750, there would be little incentive to continue to bring those
actions.

ORDER ON CROSS MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

SOROKIN, United States District Judge

This federal copyright law case concerns several audiovisual recordings of the now-deceased international superstar Prince
Rogers Nelson (""Prince"") performing his own musical compositions live in concert. Plaintiff Comerica Bank & Trust, N.A., in
its capacity as the appointed Personal Representative of Prince's Estate (""Comerica""), alleges that several videos recorded
and uploaded to YouTube by Defendant Kian Andrew Habib (""Habib"") constitute copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. §
501 and violate the civil anti-bootlegging statute, 17 U.S.C. § 1101. Doc. No. 27 at 4-5. In response, Habib raises multiple
defenses to Comerica's two claims and counterclaims that takedown notices sent on behalf of Comerica to YouTube were
""knowingly, material misrepresent[ations]"" in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 512(f). Doc. No. 30. For the following reasons,
Comerica's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 77) is ALLOWED IN PART and Habib's Cross Motion for
Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 84) is DENIED.

|. BACKGROUND +

Prince is one of the best-selling musical artists of all time. Doc. No. 81-7 at 2 (representing that Prince has sold over 100
million records worldwide). A virtuosic performer and prolific songwriter, Prince crafted a unique amalgam of funk, rock,
rhythm and blues, and soul, yielding chart-topping studio recordings and electrifying live shows. Id. ; see also Press Release,
The White House, Statement by the President on the Passing of Prince (Apr. 21, 2016),
https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/21/statement-president-passing-prince (""He was a virtuoso
instrumentalist, a brilliant bandleader, and an electrifying performer.""). Over the course of his 38-year career, Prince also
earned a reputation as a musician who demanded control over the release and use of his music, ""enforc[ing] his intellectual
property rights aggressively"" to achieve that end. Doc. No. 81-7 at 2-3 (noting that Prince ""employed staff whose sole task
was to send take-down notices to [alleged] online infringers"").

After Prince's untimely April 21, 2016 death, Comerica was appointed Personal Representative of Prince's Estate and
assumed its current role as a ""fiduciary charged with monetizing and protecting the Estate's intellectual property for the
benefit of [Prince's] heirs."" Doc. No. 83 at 2. In that capacity, Comerica now operates

[433 F.Supp.3d 86]

an official Prince YouTube channel, which includes live concert videos. Id. at 4. According to Comerica, the official Prince
YouTube channel has yielded ""well over $1 million"" in revenue for the Estate. Id. Given the YouTube channel's success,
Comerica ""expects to monetize additional [Prince] concert videos in the future."" Id.

As Comerica aims to maximize the impact of the official Prince YouTube channel, it also ""makes a concerted effort to
identify and remove unauthorized Prince videos on other channels"" that might divert interest and revenue away from the
Estate. Id. at 5. To that end, from March 2017 to March 2019, Comerica utilized the services of MarkMonitor, which deploys
a ""proprietary software [that] scours the internet for potential infringements of [ ] clients' trademarks and copyrights"" and
employs ""experienced analyst[s]"" who then review potential infringements before further action is taken. Doc. No. 81-8 4 2,
5. Over the course of those two years, MarkMonitor ""sent over 2,800 takedown notices"" to YouTube on behalf of the Estate.
Id. 44.

Five of those notices were sent in response to videos uploaded by Habib—the recordings at issue in this case. Id. § 11.
Habib filmed those recordings from his vantage point as an audience member at two different Prince performances, a
December 27, 2013 concert at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut, and a May 23, 2015 concert at the Bell Centre in
Montreal. Doc. No. 30 at 6-7. Habib concedes he did not have express authorization from Prince to record any portion of
either performance. Doc. No. 110 § 20. 2Habib later uploaded five discrete portions of the two performances on YouTube:
First, on February 28, 2014, Habib uploaded a 2 minute and 49 second audiovisual clip of Prince performing the song ""Glam


--- Page 2 ---
Slam"" at the Mohegan Sun Arena, Doc. No. 30 at 7; next, on April 25, 2016, Habib uploaded a 4 minute and 48 second
video including Prince's performance of ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" at the Mohegan Sun Arena concert, id. ; finally, on May 24,
2016, Habib uploaded (1) a 2 minute and 23 second video of Prince performing the song ""Guitar"" live in Montreal, Doc. 80-8
at 35, (2) a 2 minute and 25 second video of Prince performing the song ""Take Me With U"" in concert in Montreal, Doc. No.
30 at 8, and (3) a3 minute and 25 second video of Prince performing the songs ""Sign o' the Times,” ""Most Beautiful Girl in
the World,"" and ""Hot Thing,” id.

These five audiovisual recordings—fairly described as ""grainy,"" ""blurry,"" and ""poor quality""—each contain significant and
recognizable portions of six musical compositions that Prince composed and registered with the United States Copyright
Office. Doc. Nos. 78-1—78-8 (providing copies of U.S. Copyright Office Registration Certificates for ""Nothing Compares 2 U,""
""Take Me With U,"" ""Glam Slam,"" ""Sign o' the Times,"" ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,"" and ""Hot Thing""). 8 For example,
Habib's audiovisual recording of ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" begins in the middle of the first verse of the song and continues
until the end of the composition. Doc. No. 79-3 (Habib's video on file with the Court); Doc.

[433 F.Supp.3d 87]

No. 81-6 (highlighting the substantial portion of the song's lyrics captured by Habib's video). In each video, the camera is
focused on Prince and his band, with Habib intermittently panning between the stage and a jumbotron screen that magnified
the featured performers. See, e.g. , Doc. No. 79-3; Doc. No. 79-6 (videos of ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" and ""Sign o' the Times""
on file with the Court). The parties do not dispute that Habib did not alter any aspect of the musical performances or the
visuals captured by his recordings before he uploaded the videos to YouTube. Doc. No. 80-8 at 32; Doc. No. 81-4 at 22 (""I
didn't add anything to the music or anything.""). In addition, the parties do not dispute that Habib's videos do not capture any
spoken commentary and merely feature Prince's ""spontaneous interactions with his fellow band members and the audience,
as well as the singing of the crowd."" Doc. No. 108 at 7.

Habib uploaded the five videos to the ""PersianCeltic"" YouTube channel that he operates. Doc. No. 110 at 11. When he did
so, Habib gave titles to the various videos, see Doc. No. 83 at 6 (including titles like ""Prince — Nothing Compares 2 U —
Amazing LIVE rare performance — 2013"" and ""Prince showing off all his talents! LIVE at Mohegan Sun, Connecticut 2013""),
but did not otherwise include any written commentary or criticism. Additionally, the parties do not dispute that Habib's
""PersianCeltic"" YouTube page included an ""About"" section that described his channel as containing ""[e]clectic"" and
""awesome content,"" and encouraged YouTube users to ""subscribe and comment."" Doc. No. 80-7. As of November 6, 2018,
Habib's channel had received 405,336 views, including thousands of views for each of the videos at issue in this case. Id. ;
Doc. No. 80-3.

In 2017, MarkMonitor identified Habib's videos as potentially infringing Prince's musical composition copyrights. Doc. No. 81-
8 at 4. According to Erika Vergara, Client Services Manager at MarkMonitor, after Habib's five videos were flagged as
potentially infringing, ""a MarkMonitor analyst watched the videos and applied [the company's] standard practices, including
an assessment of fair use."" 41d. After concluding that the videos were infringing, MarkMonitor then sent takedown notices to
YouTube on Comerica's behalf for each of Habib's five videos. Id. 5

Upon receiving the takedown notices, YouTube removed the five videos and notified Habib. Doc. Nos. 79-8—79-10. Those
notifications explained that, amongst other reasons, takedown notifications might have been issued because ""[o]ne or more
of [Habib's] videos contained copyrighted material.""

[433 F.Supp.3d 88]

Doc. No. 79-1. YouTube further explained that ""[clopyright owners can choose to take down videos that contain their
content"" and informed Habib that YouTube had ""disabled [access to the five videos] as a result of a third-party notification
from [MarkMonitor] claiming that [the videos are] infringing."" Doc. No. 78-11. Moreover, YouTube advised Habib that his
account would be terminated if he did not ""delete any videos to which [he] did not own the rights,"" id. , and asked him to
refrain from ""upload[ing] videos that contain copyrighted content that you aren't allowed to use."" Doc. No. 79-1.

In response, Habib submitted five identical counter-notifications, in each instance averring that his videos were ""fair use""
because the videos were, in Habib's view, ""noncommercial and transformative in nature ... use[d] no more of the original
than necessary, and ha[d] no negative effect on the market for the work."" Doc. No. 79-11. According to Habib, he submitted
these counter-notifications ""casually,"" Doc. No. 81-4 at 11 (transcript of Habib's deposition), and the parties do not dispute
that Habib did not seek legal advice before submitting his counter-notifications. Doc. No. 80-8 at 10 (transcript of Habib's
deposition). In fact, Habib explained in his deposition that he used ""a prewritten legal description of fair use"" that he
submitted because he ""agree[d] with it."" Id. at 16.

After receiving Habib's counter-notifications, YouTube provided Comerica with Habib's counter-notifications and informed
Comerica that YouTube ""await[ed] evidence ... that [Comerica had] filed an action seeking a court order against [Habib] to
restrain the allegedly infringing activity."" Doc. No. 79-11. In response, Comerica filed the instant lawsuit, alleging musical
composition copyright infringement and violations of the anti-bootlegging statute. Doc. No. 27. Notwithstanding the
commencement of this case, Habib has continued to post videos that he recorded at live musical performances. Doc. No.
80-8 at 6 (stating in his deposition that ""[t]here's nothing wrong with posting concert videos"").

ll. LEGAL STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate when ""the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the


--- Page 3 ---
movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Once a party ""has properly supported its motion for
summary judgment, the burden shifts to the non-moving party, who ‘may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his
pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.’ ""Barbour v. Dynamics Research Corp.
63 F.3d 32 , 37 (1st Cir. 1995) (quotingAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. _ 477 U.S. 242 , 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d
202 (1986) ). The Court is ""obliged to [ ] view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and to draw all
reasonable inferences in the nonmoving party's favor."" LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co. , 6 F.3d 836, 841 (1st Cir. 1993). Even
so, the Court is to ignore ""conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation."" Prescott v. Higgins
538 F.3d 32 , 39 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Medina—Mufioz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. , 896 F.2d 5 , 8 (1st Cir. 1990) ). A
court may enter summary judgment ""against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an
element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial."" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett
477 U.S. 317 , 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . When cross-motions for summary judgment are presented, the
Court ""must consider each motion separately"" and draw all inferences against each moving party in turn.

[433 F.Supp.3d 89]
Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co. . 126 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997).

Ill. DISCUSSION

The Court considers, in turn, Comerica's two allegations: (1) that Habib's videos infringed Prince's copyrights; and (2) that
Habib's videos violated the anti-bootlegging statute, 17 U.S.C. § 1101. Then, the Court addresses Habib's sole
counterclaim, alleging that takedown notices sent on Comerica's behalf were violative of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(""DMCA""), 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).

A. Comerica's Claims

As to Comerica's claims—copyright infringement and violation of the anti-bootlegging statute—and Habib's affirmative
defenses, the Court first considers Comerica's motion for summary judgment, drawing all reasonable inferences in Habib's
favor. Then, the Court considers Habib's cross-motion for summary judgment on Comerica's two claims, as well as his
motion for summary judgment on his affirmative defenses, drawing all reasonable inferences in Comerica's favor. Mandel v.
Boston Phoenix, Inc. , 456 F.3d 198 , 205 (1st Cir. 2006) (""The presence of cross-motions for summary judgment neither
dilutes nor distorts [the familiar summary judgment] standard of review."").

1. Count |: Infringement of Prince's Musical Composition Copyrights

a. Infringement

""To establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must concurrently proceed down two roads and prove two elements: (1)
ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original."" Soc'y of Holy
Transfiguration Monastery, Inc. v. Gregory , 689 F.3d 29 , 39 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv.
Co. . 499 U.S. 340, 361,111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) ).

The Copyright Act provides that copyright protection for musical compositions—like all other instances of copyright
protection—vests initially in the composer. See 17 U.S.C. § 201(a) (""Copyright in a work ... vests initially in the author or
authors of the work.""); see also 17 U.S.C. § 102 (listing musical compositions as protectable subject matter under the
Copyright Act and defining ""musical works"" to include ""accompanying words""). Additionally, the Copyright Act states that
""ownership of a copyright ... may be bequeathed by will or pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate
succession."" 17 U.S.C. § 201(d). Finally, ""certificates of copyright [issued by the U.S. Copyright Office] are prima facie
evidence of [a plaintiff's] ownership of valid copyright interests in [their] works."" Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. ASP. Consulting
LLC , 560 F.3d 53 , 58 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 410(c) ).

Here, there can be no dispute that Comerica, in its capacity as appointed Personal Representative of Prince's Estate, has
demonstrated its ownership of valid copyrights in the six musical compositions at issue in its infringement claim. See Doc.
Nos. 78-1—78-8 (providing copies of U.S. Copyright Office Registration Certificates); Minn. Stat. Ann. § 524.3-709 (West
2019) (providing that, under Minnesota law, ""every personal representative has a right to, and shall take possession or
control of, the decedent's property ... unless or until, in the judgment of the personal representative, possession of the
property by the personal representative will be necessary for purposes of administration""). Rather than dispute valid
ownership, Habib argues that his videos do not infringe the six copyrights at issue in this case because he did not record
Prince performing

433 F.Supp.3d 90]

studio versions"" of his musical compositions. Doc. No. 85 at 4. Further, Habib argues that the copyright registrations in
Comerica's possession do not ""cover the live performances at issue in this suit."" Id. at 4.0.1.6

Habib's arguments misunderstand both the nature and scope of copyright protection for musical compositions. First, as the
U.S. Copyright Office explains, ""[s]ound recordings and musical compositions are considered two separate works for
copyright purposes."" U.S. Copyright Office, Circular 56A: Copyright Registration of Musical Compositions and Sound
Recordings (Mar. 2019), https:/www.copyright.gov/circs/circ56a.pdf (noting that ""[e]ven though a sound recording is a
derivative work of the underlying musical composition, a copyright in a sound recording is not the same as, or a substitute
or, copyright in the underlying musical composition""); accord Conway v. Licata , 104 F. Supp. 3d 104, 120 (D. Mass. 2015).



--- Page 4 ---
Comerica correctly observes that ""copyrights in musical compositions cover the music (the melody, rhythm, and/or harmony)
and accompanying words (lyrics)."" Doc. No. 83 at 2. In fact, ""if words and music have been integrated into a single work, the
copyright in a ‘musical work’ protects against unauthorized use of the music alone or of the words alone, or of a combination
of music and words."" 1 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 2.05[C]. Copyright protection for these
components of a musical composition grants copyright owners—here, Prince's Estate—the exclusive right to ""reproduce the
copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords"" and to ""distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
public."" 17 U.S.C. § 106. To that end, courts have consistently ""recognized a copyright holder's right to control the
synchronization of musical compositions with the content of audiovisual works and have required parties to obtain
synchronization licenses from copyright holders."" Leadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music Pub. , 512 F.3d 522, 527 (9th Cir. 2008) ;
see also ABKCO Music, Inc. v. Stellar Records, Inc. , 96 F.3d 60, 63 n.4 (2d Cir. 1996) (""A synchronization license is
required if a copyrighted musical composition is to be used in ‘timed-relation’ or synchronization with an audiovisual work."")
(citation omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Salinger v. Colting _ 607 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 2010); 6 Nimmer on Copyright §
30.02 [F][3].

It is of no moment that the performances recorded by Habib were ""far removed from, and not recognizable as, the studio
version|[s] of ... particular song[s]."" Doc. No. 85 at 4. Indeed, each performance of a given musical composition—whether

[433 F.Supp.3d 91]

fixed in a specific sound recording or played with a live band at a concert venue—falls well within the scope of the copyright
protection afforded to musical compositions. 2 Notably, courts have consistently held that an arrangement of a musical
composition may not be considered a separate derivative work if the arrangement is ""merely a stylized version of the original
song ... [that] may take liberties with the lyrics or the tempo"" and regurgitates ""basically the original tune."" Woods v. Bourne
Co. , 60 F.3d 978 , 991 (2d Cir. 1995) ;accord 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 2.05[D]. And courts have long held that the right to
create new versions of a composition is an entitlement that lies at the core of the Copyright Act's protection of musical
works. See Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Foullon , 79 F. Supp. 664, 665-66 (S.D.N.Y. 1948) (""There is no doubt that the
copyright owner of a musical composition has a right to make a version and arrangement.""), affid . 171 F.2d 905 (2d Cir.
1949) . Accordingly, Comerica need not ""separately register for copyright protection ... every live performance of every
[Prince] song"" in order to avail itself of the Copyright Act's remedies, Doc. No. 83 at 3, nor does Comerica's infringement
claim seek to ""mold ] [the musical composition copyrights] beyond the material they actually protect,"" as Habib claims. Doc.
No. 85 at 10.

Thus, drawing all reasonable inferences in Habib's favor, Comerica has firmly established copyright infringement as to the
six copyrighted musical compositions.

b. Affirmative Defenses

Habib raises several affirmative defenses in his Answer to Comerica's Amended Complaint. Doc. No. 30. Like all
defendants, Habib ""bears the burden of proving such defenses."" Getty Images (US), Inc. v. Her Campus Media, LLC , No.
19-CV-11084-LTS, 2019 WL 5552332, at *1 (D. Mass. Oct. 28, 2019). First, the Court considers whether, as Habib claims,
his videos constitute ""fair use"" of the copyrighted musical compositions. 17 U.S.C. § 107 ; Doc. No. 30 at 5 (providing that
Habib's third affirmative defense is ""fair use""). Then, the Court takes up Habib's additional defenses.

1. Fair Use

""The fair use doctrine is a statutory exception to copyright infringement."" Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd.
448 F.3d 605 , 608 (2d Cir. 2006). The doctrine ""creates a privilege for others to use ... copyrighted material in a reasonable
manner despite the lack of the owner's consent."" Gregory . 689 F.3d at 59 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting Weissmann v. Freeman
868 F.2d 1313 , 1323 (2d Cir. 1989) ). It also ""serves to mediate ‘the inevitable tension between the property rights’

[433 F.Supp.3d 92]

lying in creative works ‘and the ability of authors, artists, and the rest of us to express them,’ providing a degree of protection
to each where merited."" Id. (quoting Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244, 250 (2d Cir. 2006) ).

Section 107 of the Copyright Act codifies the fair use doctrine and sets forth the four familiar factors that a court must
consider when the fair use defense is raised. See 17 U.S.C. § 107 (noting that fair use may be found when a work is used
""for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, ... scholarship, or research""). The four fair use factors
are: (1) ""the purpose and character of the use;"" (2) ""the nature of the copyrighted work;"" (3) ""the amount and substantiality of
he portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;"" and (4) ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for
or value of the copyrighted work."" Id. While ""[f]air use is a mixed question of law and fact,"" Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v.
Nation Enterprises , 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) , a court may properly resolve fair use at

he summary judgment stage where, as here, ""no material historical facts are at issue"" and ""[t]he parties dispute only the
ultimate conclusions to be drawn from the admitted facts."" Fitzgerald v. CBS Broad.., Inc. _ 491 F. Supp. 2d 177, 183 (D.
Mass. 2007) (quoting Fisher v. Dees , 794 F.2d 432 , 436 (9th Cir. 1986) ). Accordingly, the Court now considers each of the
our fair use factors in turn.

a. Purpose and Character of the Use

Under the first prong of the fair use analysis, the Court must assess ""whether and to what extent the new work is


--- Page 5 ---
‘transformative.’ ""Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569, 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)
(quoting Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard , 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1111 (1990) ). That is, the Court must
determine ""whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation ... or instead adds something new,
with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message."" Id. ; accord
Folsom v. Marsh , 9 F. Cas. 342, 345 (No. 4,901) (C. C. D. Mass. 1841) (Story, J.) (holding that a work is transformative
when there is ""real, substantial condensation of the materials, and intellectual labor and judgment bestowed thereon; and
not merely the facile use of the scissors; or extracts of the essential parts, constituting the chief value of the original work"").

Habib posits that his videos are ""transformative in nature because Habib specifically chose the vantage point to record from
and alternated between shots of the performance and reactions from the crowd."" Doc. No. 85 at 12. Additionally, he avers
that the faint ""bantering and [crowd] interactions"" captured by his videos render them transformative. Id. Finally, he argues
that his ""own comments and descriptions of the performances themselves""—ostensibly referring to his chosen titles for the
videos, see, e.g. , Doc. No. 83 at 6 (reporting that Habib gave his videos titles like ""Prince — Nothing Compares 2 U —
Amazing LIVE rare performance — 2013"" and ""Prince showing off all his talents! LIVE at Mohegan Sun, Connecticut 2013"")—
weigh in favor of recognizing his videos as transformative. Id.

These arguments miss the mark. Critically, Habib did not imbue Prince's musical compositions with new meaning or add any
of his own expression to the underlying works. See Doc. No. 81-4 at 22 (""I didn't add anything to the music or anything.""). As
the First Circuit has held, this type of ""verbatim"" copying ""reflects minimal intellectual labor and judgment."" Gregory . 689
F.3d at 60 . Typically,

[433 F.Supp.3d 93

such ""verbatim"" copying may only be considered transformative when the copying serves ""a purpose separate and distinct
from the original artistic ... purpose for which the [works] were created,"" like news reporting or documentary filmmaking. Bill
Graham Archives , 448 F.3d at 610 ; see also Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Passport Video , 349 F.3d 622 , 628-29 (9th Cir.
2003) (finding the use of television clips of Elvis' musical performances to be transformative where ""the clips play[ed] for only
a few seconds and [were] used for reference purposes while a narrator talk[ed] over them or interviewees explain[ed] their
context in Elvis' career,"" but not to be transformative where the clips ""play[ed] without much interruption, [and t]he purpose
of showing these clips likely [went] beyond merely making a reference for a biography, but instead serve[d] the same
intrinsic entertainment value that is protected by Plaintiffs' copyrights""); Hofheinz v. A & E Television Networks, Inc. . 146 F.
Supp. 2d 442 , 446-47 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (holding that unauthorized use of film clips in an actor's biographical film was
protected by the fair use doctrine because the clips were ""not shown to recreate the creative expression reposing in
plaintiff's [copyrighted] film, [but] for the transformative purpose of enabling the viewer to understand the actor's modest
beginnings in the film business"").

Here, Habib's videos serve no such transformative purpose. In fact, the record is devoid of evidence that might support
Habib's claim that his videos are ""educational"" or ""historical"" in nature. Doc. No. 86 at 7-8. And to the extent his video titles
are original contributions, they are mere ""message[s] of approval [that do] not endow the copyrighted material with any new
purpose."" Bell v. Pacific Ridge Builders. Inc. , No. 19-cv-01307-JST, Doc. No. 21 (N.D. Cal. June 4, 2019):cf. Nufiez v.
Caribbean Int'l News Corp. . 235 F.3d 18 , 23 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that ""using [copyrighted] photographs in conjunction
with editorial commentary "" was transformative) (emphasis added). Indeed, as Comerica notes, Habib's videos do nothing
more than ""repackage or republish the original copyrighted [musical compositions],"" Authors Guild v. HathiTrust _ 755 F.3d
87 , 96 (2d Cir. 2014), albeit in a ""grainy"" and ""blurry"" fashion. Doc. No. 80-8 at 26. Accordingly, the Court concludes that his
videos are not transformative in nature.

Nonetheless, Habib additionally argues that the first fair use factor weighs in his favor because his videos are ""non-
commercial recording[s],"" protesting that he ""never sought or received any profit whatsoever"" and ""never even [began] ...
preliminary steps to monetize his YouTube account."" Doc. No. 85 at 11. However, as the First Circuit has held, ""removing
money from the equation does not, under copyright law, remove liability for transgressing another's works."" Gregory . 689
F.3d at 61 . The Court's inquiry, therefore, does not end with a finding that Habib's use was non-commercial; rather, it turns
on ""whether [Habib] stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price."" Harper
& Row . 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ."" ‘Profit,’ in this context, is ... not limited simply to dollars and coins; instead, it
encompasses other non-monetary calculable benefits or advantages."" Gregory , 689 F.3d at 61 . Here, Habib sought to drive
traffic to his YouTube channel by posting ""rare"" and ""[a]mazing"" videos of Prince performing his musical compositions in
concert. See Doc. No. 80-7 (quoting Habib's user-facing description of the contents of his YouTube page as ""awesome,"" and
encouraging YouTube users ""subscribe and comment you won't regret it!""). Thus, Habib stood ""to gain recognition ...
through [his] posting of [Prince's musical

[433 F.Supp.3d 94]

compositions] online"" and ""benefitted by being able to provide the protected works free of cost"" to other YouTube users.
Penguin Grp. (USA) Inc. v. Am. Buddha , No. CV-13-02075-TUC-JGZ, 2015 WL 11170727, at *4 (D. Ariz. May 11, 2015) ;
see also Northland Family Planning Clinic. Inc. v. Ctr. for Bio-Ethical Reform , 868 F. Supp. 2d 962, 979 (C.D. Cal. 2012)
(holding that ""[g]enerating traffic to one's website ... using copyrighted material is within the type of ‘profit’ contemplated"" by
the first fair use factor). Accordingly, the ""non-commercial"" nature of Habib's videos is far from dispositive and, if anything,
counsels against a finding of fair use. Therefore, the Court concludes that the first factor weighs decisively in Comerica's
favor.

b. Nature of the Copyrighted Work



--- Page 6 ---
The second factor of the fair use inquiry requires the Court to consider two elements: (1) ""whether the [musical
compositions] are factual or creative,"" and (2) ""whether the [musical compositions] have previously been published.""
Gregory . 689 F.3d at 61 . First, as Comerica correctly states, musical compositions are highly creative works that fall within
the core of copyright law's protection. See Leadsinger, Inc. , 512 F.3d at 531 (""Original song lyrics are a work of creative
expression, as opposed to an informational work, which is precisely the sort of expression that the copyright law aims to
protect.""); Campbell . 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (holding that a Roy Orbison musical composition ""falls within the core
of the copyrights protective purposes""). As to the second element, there is no dispute that the musical compositions at issue
in this case were previously published by Prince. 8Nonetheless, the fact that these musical compositions were previously
published and registered by Prince ""does not mean that this inquiry weighs in favor of fair use, only that [the compositions]
do not fall into the category of private works to which the doctrine of fair use is especially unsuited."" Fitzgerald . 491 F. Supp.
2d at 187 . Given that the works in question lie at the core of copyright law's protection, the second factor weighs against a
finding of fair use. See Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 710 (2d Cir. 2013) (""[T]here is no dispute that [plaintiff's] work is
creative and published. Accordingly, this factor weighs against a fair use determination."").

c. Amount and Substantiality of the Use

""The third factor requires [the Court] to consider ‘the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole.’ "" Gregory , 689 F.3d at 62 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 107(3) ). This inquiry ""must be a flexible one,
rather than a simple determination of the percentage used,"" Nufez , 235 F.3d at 24 , focusing on the significance, as well as
he quantity, of the copied material. See Rogers v. Koons , 960 F.2d 301, 311 (2d Cir. 1992) (""Even more critical than the
quantity is the qualitative degree of the copying: what degree of the essence of the original is copied in relation to its
whole.""). Notably, the third factor tilts against a finding of fair use when a party copies ""the most interesting and moving
parts"" of a

433 F.Supp.3d 95]

work, Harper & Row , 471 U.S. at 565 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 , as well as ""when more of the original is copied than necessary.""
Rogers , 960 F.2d at 311.

Habib argues that the third factor weighs in his favor because his videos, in aggregate, add up to ""approximately 17
minutes"" of run-time, which he contrasts with the ""approximately 6 hours"" total of the two Prince concerts he attended. Doc.
No. 85 at 12. However, the relevant ""analysis is not how much of the full concert Habib [copied and] distributed, but how
much of each copyrighted musical composition he copied."" Doc. No. 83 at 9; see also Campbell , 510 U.S. at 586 -89, 114
S.Ct. 1164 (treating a single song as a whole work for purposes of the fair use analysis). Habib's videos copied significant
and valuable portions of the six musical compositions, in many cases capturing multiple verses and recognizable refrains.
See, e.g. , Doc. No. 79-3 (capturing almost all of ""Nothing Compares 2 U,"" beginning at the middle of the first verse and
continuing through the end of the composition); Doc. No. 79-6 (presenting the second verse and chorus of ""Sign o' the
Times""). Significantly, the videos ""appropriated the heart"" of the musical compositions, Harper & Row . 471 U.S. at 600 , 105
S.Ct. 2218 , ""providing the viewer with the best parts of each copyrighted work.""Elvis Presley Enterprises v. Passport Entm't
, No. CV 02-7042 RSWL(RZX), 2005 WL 6211336, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 22, 2005). And while ""[clopying does not become
excessive ... merely because the portion taken was the original's heart,"" Campbell _ 510 U.S. at 588 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 , when
copying is carried out "" ‘for the same intrinsic purpose for which [the composer] intended [the song] to be used,’ this third
factor weighs against [Habib's] contention of fair use."" Gregory , 689 F.3d at 63 (quoting Marcus v. Rowley , 695 F.2d 1171,
1175 (9th Cir. 1983) ). Accordingly, the third factor weighs in Comerica's favor.

d. Effect on the Market

The fourth fair use factor probes ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" 17
U.S.C. § 107(4). Often said to be ""the single most important element of fair use,"" Harper & Row , 471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct.
2218 , the fourth factor directs courts to ""consider both (1) the degree of market harm caused by the alleged infringer's
actions, and (2) ‘whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant ... would result in a
substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original.’ "" Gregory , 689 F.3d at 64 (quoting Campbell , 510 U.S.
at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). This factor does not consider ""whether the secondary use suppresses or even destroys the market
for the original work or its potential derivatives, but whether the secondary use usurps the market of the original work.""
Cariou , 714 F.3d at 708 (quoting Blanch , 467 F.3d at 258 ).

Comerica avers that Prince's Estate ""loses revenue whenever someone views an unofficial Prince video on another channel
instead of an official Prince video on the official Prince channel."" Doc. No. 81-7. Additionally, Comerica argues that the
proliferation of ""low quality videos,"" like Habib's, harms the Estate's ability to ""preserv[e] ... its reputation for excellence ...
[by] rob[bing] [the Estate] of the ability to control the quality distribution of its works."" Penguin Grp. , 2015 WL 11170727, at
*6 ; see also Gregory . 689 F.3d at 64 (noting that courts must ""look[ ] beyond monetary or commercial"" interests when
assessing market harm). While the Court queries the extent to which the ""grainy"" and ""blurry"" visuals, muffled sound, and
pervasive audience din in Habib's videos, see. e.g. , Doc. No. 79-6, ""satisfy[ ] viewers' taste for videos of Prince
performances,"" Doc. No. 83 at 22, even

[433 F.Supp.3d 96]

drawing all inferences in Habib's favor, his videos plainly divert traffic away from authorized reproductions of the musical
compositions, thus depriving the Estate of advertising revenue. See Sony BMG Music Entm't v. Tenenbaum , 672 F. Supp.
2d 217 , 231 (D. Mass. 2009) (noting that ""the widespread availability of free copies of copyrighted works on the internet has



--- Page 7 ---
decreased [the plaintiff's] sales revenue, a market reality that other courts have credited""). Similarly, the Court is persuaded
that Habib's decidedly poor-quality recordings harm the Estate's interest in policing the caliber of secondary uses of Prince's
musical compositions. Indeed, the Copyright Act repeatedly demonstrates a commitment to musicians’ right to protect the
integrity of their compositions. See, e.g. , 17 U.S.C. § 115(a)(2) (providing that a compulsory license to record a copyrighted
musical composition does not include the right to ""change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work"").
Accordingly, the fourth factor counsels against finding fair use.

e. Balance of the Factors

As all four statutory factors weigh in Comerica's favor, Habib's fair use defense fails as a matter of law. Gregory . 689 F.3d at
65 (""Having carefully balanced the scales, [the Court] conclude[s] that [Habib's] defense of fair use fails in full.""). Habib has
failed to ""carry his evidentiary burden” as to his third affirmative defense to copyright infringement. Gregory . 689 F.3d at 59 .
Accordingly, Comerica's motion for summary judgment as to Habib's fair use defense is ALLOWED and Habib's cross
motion for summary judgment on the fair use defense is DENIED.

2. Habib's Other Defenses to Infringement

Habib's additional defenses fare no better. As already discussed, Comerica has plainly stated a claim for copyright
infringement; thus, Habib's first and second affirmative defenses fail. Doc. No. 30 at 4. Habib's fourth affirmative defense,
which states that relief in this action is limited by 17 U.S.C. § 504(c), provides no defense at all; it merely references the
applicable statutory regime for determining damages in a copyright infringement case. Habib's fifth defense, arguing that ""his
conduct was in good faith ... and lacked any wrongful intent,"" is not a safeguard at the liability stage of a copyright
infringement suit. Daggs v. Bass , No. CIV.A. 11-30070-FDS, 2012 WL 5878670, at *5 (D. Mass. Nov. 20, 2012) (noting that
""intent is irrelevant to copyright infringement, at least at the stage of liability""). 2 Similarly, Habib's sixth defense, protesting
that he should not be held liable because he did not profit from his use of Prince's compositions, also fails as a matter of
law. Capitol Records, Inc. v. Alaujan , 626 F. Supp. 2d 152, 155 (D. Mass. 2009) (""Non-commercial use is clearly not a
complete defense to liability for copyright infringement, but only one of several factors considered as part of the fair use
defense.""). Finally, Habib's seventh, eighth, and ninth defenses all fail, as there is no evidence that Comerica waived its
infringement claim, that it was estopped from bringing that claim, or that the claim is time barred (i.e., the infringement at
issue plainly occurred within three years of the commencement of this suit).

Thus, even drawing all reasonable inferences in Habib's favor, Comerica has firmly established the requisite elements of

[433 F.Supp.3d 97]

copyright infringement and established that Habib cannot carry his evidentiary burden as to any of his affirmative defenses.
Thus, Comerica's motion for summary judgment is ALLOWED as to its claim of copyright infringement and as to Habib's
affirmative defenses; accordingly, Habib's cross motion for summary judgment as to the same is DENIED. 12

c. Willful Infringement

The Copyright Act permits a court to ""increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not more than $150,000"" where
a defendant's infringement is willful. 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2). ""Infringement is willful if the defendants knew or should have
known that their conduct constituted copyright infringement, or acted in reckless disregard of the copyright holder's rights.""
Homeowner Options for Massachusetts Elders, Inc. v. Brookline Bancorp, Inc. , 789 F. Supp. 2d 242, 244 (D. Mass. 2011) ;
accord Sony BMG Music Entm't v. Tenenbaum , 660 F.3d 487 , 507 (1st Cir. 2011). ""Although courts are generally reluctant
to dispose of a case on summary judgment when mental state is at issue, it is permissible to do so where there are sufficient
undisputed material facts on the record to make the question appropriate for summary judgment."" Lipton v. Nature Co. . 71
F.3d 464 , 472 (2d Cir. 1995).

Comerica contends that, at a minimum, there is undisputed evidence that Habib acted with reckless disregard, thereby
entitling Comerica to a finding of willfulness on their claim of copyright infringement. Doc. No. 83 at 24. The Court concurs.
Notwithstanding the fact that Habib received—and did not dispute—multiple Content ID claims informing him that his
audiovisual recordings of live musical performances contained copyrighted material, Habib continued to post similar videos,
assuming that he would escape legal liability merely because some copyright owners elected to allow his videos to remain
live. Doc. No. 80-8 at 24 (admitting that ""[i]t's the artist's choice"" to decide whether a video containing infringing material
should remain published on YouTube); see also Broad. Music, Inc. v. C.B.G., Inc. , No. CIV.A. 11-40142-TSH, 2013 WL
6074121, at *5 (D. Mass. Nov. 15, 2013) (holding that it is willful to ignore ""repeated notices"" and warnings that behavior
constitutes copyright infringement). Indeed, his unflagging conviction—one that he has maintained throughout this copyright
infringement suit—that ""every artist ... encourage[s] people to post video[s]"" of live musical performances, Doc. No. 80-8 at
25, demonstrates an unreasonable disregard for the exclusive rights afforded to musicians under the Copyright Act. 17
U.S.C. § 106. Moreover, his ""casuall ]"" counter-notification submissions, Doc. No. 81-4 at 11, recklessly assumed that
parroting the statutory fair use factors is an adequate substitute for either seeking out legal advice or carefully evaluating the
applicability of the fair use doctrine. Finally, Habib has presented no mitigating evidence tending to show that he held a
""reasonable"" belief that his videos were not infringing. See, e.g. , Broad. Music. Inc. v. Arlos , 682 F. Supp. 1, 2 (D. Mass.
1986) (holding that a ""defendant must demonstrate not only a good faith belief that the infringement was innocent, but that
his belief was reasonable"").

For these reasons, Comerica's motion for summary judgment that Habib engaged in willful infringement of Prince's musical
composition copyrights is ALLOWED


--- Page 8 ---
[433 F.Supp.3d 98]
and Habib's cross-motion is DENIED.

2. Count Il: Violation of the Anti-Bootlegging Statute

In addition to its copyright infringement claim, Comerica alleges that Habib's actions violate the civil anti-bootlegging statute,
17 U.S.C. § 1101. Section 1101(a), also known as the ""anti-bootlegging statute,"" provides:

(a) Unauthorized acts. Anyone who, without the consent of the performer or performers involved—

(1) fixes the sounds or sounds and images of a live musical performance in a copy or phonorecord, or
reproduces copies or phonorecords of such a performance from an unauthorized fixation,

(2) transmits or otherwise communicates to the public the sounds or sounds and images of a live musical
performance, or

(3) distributes or offers to distribute, sells or offers to sell, rents or offers to rent, or traffics in any copy or
phonorecord fixed as described in paragraph (1), regardless of whether the fixations occurred in the United
States, shall be subject to the remedies provided in sections 502 through 505, to the same extent as an infringer
of copyright.

17 U.S.C. § 1101(a).

a. The Anti-Bootlegging Statute's Protections

Actions brought under the civil anti-bootlegging statute are not copyright infringement claims; this is so because ""the
protections that the anti-bootlegging statute[ ] confer[s] on musicians are best described as ‘quasi-copyright’ or sui generis
protections."" United States v. Moghadam , 175 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 1999). Arising out of the international Agreement
on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (""TRIPs""), 1‘the anti-bootlegging statute creates copyright-like protection
that is distinct from copyright protection in two important ways.

First, the anti-bootlegging statute extends protection to certain musical works—live performances—that have not yet been
fixed in a tangible medium (such as a musical score or a sound recording), thus bypassing copyright law's fixation
requirement. See U.S. Const. art. |, § 8, cl. 8 (providing that ""Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of
Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors ... the exclusive Right to their [ ] Writings "") (emphasis
added); Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony . 111 U.S. 53, 58,4 S.Ct. 279 , 28 L.Ed. 349 (1884) (""By writings in that
clause is meant the literary productions of those authors ... includ[ing] all forms of writing, printing, engravings, etchings, etc.,
by which the ideas in the mind of the author are given visible expression""). The few courts that have analyzed the anti-
bootlegging statute have held that unfixed live musical records are plainly not ""writings"" within the meaning of the Copyright
Clause. See, e.g. , Moghadam . 175 F.3d at 1274 (""[A]lthough in the modern era the term ‘Writings’ allows Congress to
extend copyright protection to a great many things, those things have always involved

[433 F.Supp.3d 99]

some fixed, tangible and durable form.""); David Nimmer, The End of Copyright , 48 Vand. L.Rev. 1385, 1409 (1995) (""[NJo
respectable interpretation of the word ‘Writings’ embraces an untaped performance of someone singing at Carnegie Hall."").

Second, notwithstanding the anti-bootlegging statute's placement in Chapter 17 of the United States Code, the statute does
not incorporate by express reference most of the Copyright Act's provisions. See 17 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3) (referencing only a
portion of the Copyright Act's remedies—those contained in sections 502 through 505—and leaving unmentioned any other
provisions in Title 17). Thus, courts have held that unincorporated Copyright Act sections are inapplicable to the anti-
bootlegging statute. See, e.g. , Willis v. Knight , No. 1:08-CV-705-ODE, 2008 WL 11336133, at *6 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 20, 2008)
(holding that 17 U.S.C. § 411's provision that ""no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall
be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made"" is inapplicable to actions brought
under 17 U.S.C. § 1101(a) ); KISS Catalog v. Passport Int'l Prods., Inc. , 350 F. Supp. 2d 823, 832 (C.D. Cal. 2004) (holding
that the durational limits on copyright protection contained in 17 U.S.C. § 302 were not incorporated into the anti-bootlegging
statute), vacated on other grounds , Kiss Catalog, Ltd. v. Passport Int'l Prods., Inc. , 405 F. Supp. 2d 1169 (C.D. Cal. 2005).

Case law interpreting the civil anti-bootlegging statute is sparse and largely concerns the statute's constitutionality. 12 Given
the statute's relatively rare appearance in reported cases, it is unsurprising that this lawsuit presents a novel question about
the statute's scope: whether its protections are descendible and may be invoked by the estate of a once-protected
performer. This important threshold consideration—whether section 1101's protections are descendible and, if they are not,
whether an estate has standing to assert claims under section 1101—has never been addressed by a federal court and has
not been briefed by the parties to this action. Accordingly, if Comerica so wishes, it may file a supplemental brief as to its
section 1101 claim within 21 days of the issuance of this Order; should Comerica do so, Habib may respond with his own
supplemental brief by no later than 14 days following Comerica's submission.

b. Habib's Implied License Defense

Notwithstanding the lack of resolution at this juncture as to these threshold questions, the Court deems it prudent to address


--- Page 9 ---
Habib's sole defense to Comerica's anti-bootlegging statute claim: that Prince, through quoted statements in a February 5,
2014 BBC article, granted Habib—and apparently all other Prince fans—an implied license to record and distribute Prince's
live musical performances. Doc. No. 85 at 14-15 (quoting Prince as stating,

433 F.Supp.3d 100]

[nJobody sues their fans ... fans sharing music with each other, that's cool."").

Habib rightly notes that a nonexclusive license to use a copyrighted work—where ownership of the copyright is not
ransferred—may be granted by a copyright owner in a few ways: in writing, orally, or it ""may be implied from conduct which
indicates the owner's intent to allow a licensee to use the work."" John G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-Conant Properties
Inc. , 322 F.3d 26, 40 (1st Cir. 2003). ""This kind of implied license is, by definition, of limited scope; it ‘simply permits the use
of a copyrighted work in a particular manner.’ "" Estate of Hevia v. Portrio Corp. . 602 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting
|.A.E., Inc. v. Shaver , 74 F.3d 768 , 775 (7th Cir. 1996) ); 3 Nimmer on Copyright § 10.03[A][7] (noting that courts demand
hat the terms of an implied license, as well as the ""identity of the licensee,"" be ""reasonably clear""). Thus, ""[u]ses of a
copyrighted work that stay within the bounds of an implied license do not infringe the copyright."" Estate of Hevia , 602 F.3d
at 41.

""The burden of proving the existence of such a license is on the party claiming its protection, the licensee."" Danielson , 322
F.3d at 40 (noting that ""[iJmplied licenses are found only in narrow circumstances.""). The First Circuit has underscored that
""the touchstone for finding an implied license ... is intent,"" Estate of Hevia , 602 F.3d at 41 , but has also directed courts to

consider additional, non-exhaustive factors, including:

(1) whether the parties were engaged in a short-term discrete transaction as opposed to an ongoing relationship;
(2) whether the creator utilized written contracts ... providing that copyrighted materials could only be used with
the creator's future involvement or express permission; and (3) whether the creator's conduct during the creation
or delivery of the copyrighted material indicated that use of the material without the creator's involvement or
consent was permissible.

Danielson , 322 F.3d at 41 . Here, none of the relevant factors tend to demonstrate the existence of an implied license. As
Comerica notes, ""Prince's broad, alleged statement made to the general public does not set out any license terms, does not
demonstrate an intent to contract with Habib, and indeed plainly has no relation to Habib."" Doc. No. 106 at 6. Thus, based
on the evidence before the Court, should an anti-bootlegging claim lie in this case—a determination that the Court has not
reached—Habib's implied license defense will fail.

B. Habib's Counterclaim

In response to Comerica's two claims, Habib claims that the take down notices sent by Comerica's agent, MarkMonitor,
contained ""knowingly material misrepresent[ations],"" in contravention of the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).

Under the DMCA, ""a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed"" may
send a take-down notification ""to the designated agent of a service provider,"" so long as that notification contains certain
information, including, inter alia: ""[i]Jdentification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed""; and ""[a] statement
hat the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by
he copyright owner, its agent, or the law."" 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3). Here, the undisputed evidence before the Court indicates
hat MarkMonitor had, at the very least, a ""good faith belief"" that Habib's videos infringed Prince's copyrighted musical
compositions. See Doc. No. 81-8 (describing MarkMonitor's process for identifying potentially

433 F.Supp.3d 101]

infringing material, including an initial consideration of fair use before a take-down notification is sent). Habib has offered no
evidence to the contrary; in fact, as Comerica notes, Habib ""did not even take discovery from MarkMonitor."" Doc. No. 102 at
16. When, as here, the moving party ""ha[s] not supplied a factual basis on which to find ... that [the] plaintiff ], in pursuing
akedown notices, made a knowing material misrepresentation,"" summary judgment is appropriate. Stern v. Lavender , 319
F. Supp. 3d 650, 684 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). Accordingly, as Habib has ""failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential
element of [his] case with respect to which [he] has the burden of proof,"" Celotex Corp. _ 477 U.S. at 323 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 ,
Habib's cross-motion for summary judgment as to his counterclaim is DENIED and Comerica's motion for summary
judgement as to Habib's counterclaim is ALLOWED.

C. Injunctive Relief

""A plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such relief. A plaintiff must
demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are
inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant,
a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.""
Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms , 561 U.S. 139, 156-57, 130 S.Ct. 2743 , 177 L.Ed.2d 461 (2010) (quoting eBay Inc.
v. MercExchange, L.L.C. , 547 U.S. 388 , 391, 126 S.Ct. 1837 , 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006) ) (alterations and quotation marks
omitted). A permanent injunction is an extraordinary remedy that may be granted in the exercise of a court's sound
discretion. See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. _ 555 U.S. 7, 24,129 S.Ct. 365 , 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008) . While
injunctive relief is extraordinary, ""[a] finding of liability for copyright infringement, combined with the threat of future



--- Page 10 ---
infringement, justifies the imposition of a permanent injunction."" Soc'y of the Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Inc. v. Gregory
780 F. Supp. 2d 121 , 123 (D. Mass. 2011) (quoting Cipes v. Mikasa, Inc. , 404 F.Supp.2d 367 , 371 (D. Mass. 2005) ).

Here, the Court agrees with Comerica's assessment that ""[a]osent a permanent injunction, further infringement is likely.""
Doc. No. 83 at 30. Throughout the course of this litigation, Habib has refused to engage with the demands of copyright law,
has continued to post potentially infringing videos, and has antagonized opposing counsel, see Doc. No. 81-3 at 10
(tweeting disparaging remarks about Comerica's counsel), even after Comerica ""made several attempts to resolve the case
on terms that merely required Habib to refrain from distributing unauthorized Prince videos in the future."" Doc. No. 81-9 at 3.
The Court concludes that ""a threat of future infringement remains, in light of [Habib's] repeated, current, and past acts.""
Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. Lamoco Consulting, LLC , No. 06-11557-RGS, 2011 WL 1226114, at *6 (D. Mass. Mar. 30,
2011). Thus, the Court ALLOWS Comerica's motion for a permanent injunction.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Comerica's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 77) is ALLOWED IN PART and
Habib's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 84) is DENIED.

As discussed above, Comerica may file a supplemental brief as to its section 1101 claim by January 27, 2020. Habib may
respond with his own supplemental brief by no later than 14 days following Comerica's

[433 F.Supp.3d 102]

submission. A trial on damages shall commence on March 2, 2020. See Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc. , 523
U.S. 340 , 355, 118 S.Ct. 1279 , 140 L.Ed.2d 438 (1998) (""[I]f a party so demands, a jury must determine the actual amount
of statutory damages under § 504(c) in order to preserve the substance of the common-law right of trial by jury."") (internal
quotation marks omitted). A separate order will issue establishing pre-trial deadlines.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:
1Unless specifically noted, these facts are undisputed.

2 Habib does contend that Prince granted Habib an ""implied license"" to record and post the performances, citing a 2014 BBC article with statements
attributed to Prince. See infra Part Ill.A.2.

3While the parties do not dispute that Prince also composed the song ""Guitar,"" Comerica does not have in its possession the copyright registration that
likely encompasses that song. See Doc. No. 81-9; Doc. No. 78-9. Comerica notes that it is not asserting a copyright infringement claim based on Habib's
use of ""Guitar."" Doc. No. 83 at 7 n.2. However, Comerica does assert that Habib's video of ""Guitar"" violated the anti-bootlegging statute, 17 U.S.C. §
1101. Id.

4""Fair use,"" as discussed at length below, is an affirmative defense to copyright infringement. 17 U.S.C. § 107.

5 This was not the first time that Habib had received notice that videos uploaded to his YouTube channel might contain infringing material. In fact, several
other copyright owners—including copyright owners of songs performed by the rock band Arcade Fire and the pop star Miley Cyrus—had previously
issued Content ID claims regarding Habib's videos of live musical performances. See Doc. No. 80-6 (notifying Habib that ""[clopyrighted content was
found in your video"" and that ""[t]he claimant is allowing their content to be used in your YouTube video"" so that it could be monetized); see also Bryan E.
Arsham, Monetizing Infringement: A New Legal Regime for Hosts of User-Generated Content , 101 Geo. L.J. 775, 791 (2013) (noting that YouTube's
Content ID system ""gives [copyright] holders three choices for how to deal with uploaded content that matches their work: monetize the content, track
usage, or block the content altogether.""). Habib did not dispute any of the claimants’ Content ID claims ""because [the claimants] weren't trying to remove
the video forever from the channel."" Doc. No. 80-8 at 24. Habib also stated that claimants’ decisions to permit videos to remain on YouTube and generate
revenue for the claimants, in his mind, ""raise[d] the suspicion that the video is ... not copyrighted."" Id. at 24-25.

8 Additionally, Habib argues, in passing, that he ""is the only person who can legally claim ownership of the copyright on his recording of Prince's live
performance"" because he is the ""creator"" of the videos at issue in this case. Doc. No. 85 at 9. While it is possible that Habib might enjoy copyright
protection in aspects of videos that ""satisf[y] the low threshold of originality required to earn copyright protection,"" Greene v. Ablon , 794 F.3d 133 , 160
(1st Cir. 2015), any protection that Habib might enjoy in his ""selection of ... lighting, timing, positioning, angle, and focus,"" Harney v. Sony Pictures
Television, Inc. . 704 F.3d 173 , 180 (1st Cir. 2013), or ""where [he] put the microphones"" of his cellphone, Panel Ill: United States v. Martignon-Case in
Controversy , 16 Fordham Intell. Prop. Media & Ent. L.J. 1223, 1280 (2006) (quoting Professor Jane C. Ginsburg), most certainly does not extend to
Prince's underlying copyrighted musical compositions captured by Habib's recordings. See 17 U.S.C. § 103(b) (providing that the ""copyright in [a
derivative work] is independent of, and does not affect ... any copyright protection in the preexisting material""); Gamma Audio & Video, Inc. v. Ean-Chea
11 F.3d 1106 , 1112 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting that ""[a]ny elements that the author of the derivative work borrowed from the underlying work ... remain
protected by the copyrights in the underlying work"").

2For example, the copyright registration for Prince's composition ""Nothing Compares 2 U""—one of the songs at issue in this case, Doc. No. 78-2
(reproducing the relevant certificate of registration)—protects (1) the ""studio version"" recorded by Prince in 1984 (but unreleased until 2018), see Matthew
Strauss, Listen to Prince's Original Version of ""Nothing Compares 2 U ,"" Pitchfork (Apr. 19, 2018), https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-princes-original-
version-of-nothing-compares-2-u/; (2) the chart-topping 1990 version of the song recorded by Sinéad O'Connor, see Sinéad O'Connor, | Do Not Want
What | Haven't Got (Chrysalis Records 1990); Gil Kaufman, Prince Estate Unveils Previously Unreleased Original ‘Nothing Compares 2 U’ Recording:
Listen , Billboard (Apr. 19, 2018), https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8351 077/prince-previously-unreleased-original-nothing-compares-2-u-
listen (noting that ""the heartbreak anthem ... became a breakout Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit"" for O'Connor in 1990); and (3) Prince's December 27, 2013
performance of the song that Habib recorded at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut. See Doc. No. 79-6.

8 Comerica argues that because ""Prince's live rendition of the works in Connecticut and Montreal were not [previously] published by Prince or his estate,""
Habib's videos implicated Comerica's ""power to control whether, when, and how to release [this] material."" Gregory , 689 F.3d at 61 . However, given that
this copyright infringement suit focuses on the six Prince musical compositions, the relevant inquiry is not whether the specific performances captured by
Habib had been previously published but whether the underlying musical compositions had been published. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct.



--- Page 11 ---
1164 (focusing the second fair use factor inquiry on the plaintiffs musical composition).

2 Intent, however, ""is relevant to the question of whether infringement was willful, and can be important in determining the amount of damages."" Id. at *5
n.3 ; see infra (discussing whether Habib's infringement was willful).

10 Habib's tenth affirmative defense mirrors his counterclaim and is addressed in detail below. See infra Part III.B. In any event, his allegation that
MarkMonitor's take-down notifications violated the DMCA is not an affirmative defense to copyright infringement.

1.TRIPs became law by operation of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (""URAA""), Pub.L. No. 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809 (1994). Specifically, Congress
enacted Section 1101(a) in reaction to Article 14(1) of the TRIPs agreement, which requires:

In respect of a fixation of their performance on a phonogram, performers shall have the possibility of preventing the following acts when
undertaken without their authorization: the fixation of their unfixed performance and the reproduction of such fixation. Performers shall also
have the possibility of preventing the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the broadcasting by wireless means and
the communication to the public of their live performance.

12 Several courts have examined whether section 1101(a) and its criminal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. § 2319A, are constitutional. See Moghadam . 175 F.3d
1269 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that 18 U.S.C. § 2319A is a lawful exercise of power under the Commerce Clause); United States v. Martignon , 492 F.3d
140 (2d Cir. 2007) (holding that 18 U.S.C. § 2319A(a)(1) and (3) were validly enacted under the Commerce Clause); KISS Catalog, Ltd. , 350 F. Supp.
2d 823 (C.D. Cal. 2004) (holding that the civil anti-bootlegging statute is unconstitutional because its protections are not ""for limited Times"" and do not
concern fixed ""writings"" as is required by the Copyright Clause), vacated in part by 405 F. Supp. 2d 1169 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (holding that 17 U.S.C. §
1101(a)(3) is a constitutional enactment under the Commerce Clause). While the First Circuit has not considered the constitutionality of either anti-
bootlegging statute, the Court finds decisions upholding the statutes under the Commerce Clause persuasive.

ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO QUASH; DENYING MOTION TO COMPEL
Re: Dkt. Nos. 5, 10, 22
VINCE CHHABRIA, United States District Judge

In a series of six tweets accompanied by photos, an anonymous Twitter user who goes by @CallMeMoneyBags criticized
Brian Sheth, a private-equity billionaire. Within a few weeks of the postings, a mysterious entity called Bayside Advisory LLC
registered copyrights in the photos, petitioned Twitter to take them down, and served a subpoena on Twitter for information
identifying the person behind the @CallMeMoneyBags account. Twitter has moved to quash the subpoena, arguing that
revealing the user's identity would violate his First Amendment rights. Because Bayside has not made out a prima facie case
of copyright infringement, and for the independent reason that the user's constitutional interest in anonymity outweighs
Bayside's expressed interest in his identity (at least on this record), the subpoena must be quashed.

@CallMeMoneyBags (let's call him MoneyBags) is an anonymous Twitter user. Although his account currently boasts over
sixteen thousand followers, at the time of the events leading to this dispute his following was considerably more modest,
hovering between 350 and 400. Much of his publicly viewable content consists of criticism of wealthy people, particularly
those who work in tech, finance, or politics (such as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Nancy Pelosi).

In late October 2020, MoneyBags turned his attention to Brian Sheth, a private equity billionaire. Over ten days, MoneyBags
tweeted about Sheth six times, each time commenting on Sheth's wealth and

[608 F.Supp.3d 875]

alleged lifestyle. One tweet, for example, reads: ""Brian Sheth has upgraded in his personal life. The only thing better than
having a wife ... is having a hot young girlfriend."" The tweet was accompanied by hashtags including ""#FilthyRich"" and
""#BabeAlert"" and included a photograph of a woman in a bikini and high heels. The other tweets were similar, each
containing a photo of a woman and many alluding to an extramarital affair between her and Sheth. +

On October 29, just days after this string of tweets, an entity called Bayside Advisory LLC contacted Twitter, asserting that it
had copyright ownership in the six photos and demanding that they be taken down. Four days later, Bayside registered its
copyrights. Twitter ultimately took down the challenged photos (but left the text of the tweets in place). Bayside then came to
court and obtained a subpoena requiring Twitter to provide information identifying the person behind MoneyBags's facade.
Twitter objected, arguing that doing so would violate MoneyBags's First Amendment rights. Eventually, Twitter filed a motion
to quash the subpoena and Bayside responded with a motion to compel a response to it.


--- Page 2 ---
The case was originally assigned to Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu, who issued an order offering MoneyBags an opportunity
to file evidence in support of Twitter's motion to quash. Judge Ryu ordered Twitter to serve a copy of her order and all
relevant briefing on the email address associated with MoneyBags's Twitter account and gave MoneyBags permission to
appear anonymously. MoneyBags did not respond. Judge Ryu then denied the motion to quash and granted the motion to
compel, noting that the court ""lack[ed] a well-developed record"" on which to find that MoneyBags was innocent of copyright
infringement or to balance the competing interests of the parties involved. Twitter challenges that ruling here.

Normally, a motion to quash involves a subpoena for discovery connected to a pending lawsuit. But this case is different.
Bayside requested a subpoena under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which permits copyright owners to obtain
subpoenas for information identifying alleged copyright infringers independent of any pre-existing lawsuit. 17 U.S.C. §
512(h). In this context, ""the subpoena is its own civil case, and the motion to quash is dispositive of the sole issue presented
in the case—whether the subpoena should be enforced or not."" /n re DMCA Subpoena to Reddit, Inc. , 441 F. Supp. 3d 875,
880 (N.D. Cal. 2020). Because this is a dispositive motion and the parties did not consent to magistrate judge jurisdiction,
the Court considers the motion to quash de novo. 2

[608 F.Supp.3d 876]

""[A]n author's decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning omissions or additions to the contents of a
publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment."" Mcintyre v. Ohio Elections
Commission , 514 U.S. 334 , 342,115 S.Ct. 1511 , 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) . This protection applies with equal force to
online speech. ""As with other forms of expression, the ability to speak anonymously on the Internet promotes the robust
exchange of ideas and allows individuals to express themselves freely without ‘fear of economic or official retaliation ... [or]
concern about social ostracism.’ ""In re Anonymous Online Speakers , 661 F.3d 1168 , 1173 (9th Cir. 2011) (alterations in
original) (quoting Mcintyre__514 U.S. at 341 —42, 115 S.Ct. 1511 ). When adjudicating discovery requests that would unmask
an anonymous speaker, then, courts must consider the First Amendment implications of disclosure—just as they would
when adjudicating any other discovery request that risks infringing First Amendment rights.

Perry v. Schwarzenegger offers a roadmap for how this inquiry should play out. 591 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 2010) ; see In re
Anonymous Online Speakers , 661 F.3d at 1174 . In Perry , the Ninth Circuit reviewed a district court's decision requiring the
proponents of a state ballot proposition to turn over internal communications relating to their campaign strategy. Perry. 591.
F.3d at 1152 . Upon recognizing the First Amendment interests at stake, the court balanced the plaintiffs’ interest in the

disclosures against the constitutional burden that disclosure would impose on the defendants. /d. at 1162-65. The court
issued a writ of mandamus vacating the district court's discovery order after finding that ""discovery would likely have a

chilling effect on political association,"" while the plaintiffs ""ha[d] not shown a sufficient need for the information."" /d. at 1165.

Operationally, the inquiry consists of two steps. First, the party seeking the disclosure must demonstrate a prima facie case
on the merits of its underlying claim. Second, the court balances the need for the discovery against the First Amendment
interest at stake. This resembles the analysis courts around the country have employed when adjudicating motions that
would result in the unmasking of anonymous speakers. See, e.g., Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe No. 3,342 N.J.Super.
134 , 775 A.2d 756 , 760-61 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2001) ;Highfields Capital Management, L.P. v. Doe , 385 F. Supp. 2d
969 , 974-75 (N.D. Cal. 2005) ;see also Brief of Public Citizen as Amicus Curiae in Support of Neither Party, Dkt. No. 39-1,
at 14-15. Thus, when adjudicating a subpoena or other request for compelled disclosure that would reveal the identity of an
anonymous speaker, a court should (1) notify the speaker and provide them with an opportunity to (anonymously) defend
their anonymity; (2) require the party seeking disclosure to make a prima facie showing on the merits of their claim; and (3)
balance the equities, weighing the potential harm to the party seeking disclosure against the speaker's interest in anonymity,
in light of the strength of the underlying claim.

IV

Bayside argues that three aspects of this case distinguish it from other motions in which a party seeks to unmask an
anonymous speaker, making the aforementioned test inapplicable: (1) Bayside's subpoena arises under the Digital
Millennium Copyright

[608 F.Supp.3d 877]

Act (DMCA), which provides its own procedures through which copyright holders can subpoena internet service providers;
(2) the underlying dispute is a copyright claim, and copyright law has some First Amendment protection ""built in""; and (3) the
speaker has not shown up, despite an invitation to do so anonymously. None of these distinctions support application of a
different test.

A

The DMCA provides a streamlined procedure through which copyright holders may subpoena internet service providers (like
Twitter) for information identifying an alleged copyright infringer. See 17 U.S.C. § 512(h). As discussed above, the DMCA


--- Page 3 ---
allows copyright holders to request a subpoena directly, outside the confines of a lawsuit. The statute requires prompt
compliance by the service provider: ""Upon receipt of the issued subpoena ... the service provider shall expeditiously
disclose"" the required information to the copyright owner, ""notwithstanding any other provision of law."" § 512(h)(5). Bayside
argues that this restriction divests the court of authority to consider the merits of the copyright claim or issues of First
Amendment privilege when faced with a motion to compel or quash a DMCA subpoena.

Bayside's reading of the DMCA raises serious constitutional concerns. After all, it is not enough to say that a speaker could
assert their right to anonymity after their identity has been revealed; at that point, the damage will have been done.
Fortunately, the statute does not compel (or permit) this result. Section 512(h) provides that ""the procedure for issuance and
delivery of the subpoena, and the remedies for noncompliance with the subpoena, shall be governed to the greatest extent
practicable by those provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing the issuance, service, and enforcement of
a subpoena duces tecum."" § 512(h)(6). This provision incorporates Federal Rule 45, under which a court must ""quash or
modify"" a subpoena that ""requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(A)(iii). A
recipient of a DMCA subpoena may therefore move to quash on the basis that the subpoena would require disclosure of
material protected by the First Amendment. See, e.g., Signature Management Team, LLC v. Automattic, Inc... 941 F. Supp.
2d 1145 , 1152-53 (N.D. Cal. 2013) :/n re Verizon Internet Services, Inc. , 257 F. Supp. 2d 244 , 263-64 (D.D.C. 2003),
rev'd on other grounds, Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. v. Verizon Internet Services, Inc. , 351 F.3d 1229
(D.C. Cir. 2003) . The fact that the DMCA allows a potential copyright infringement victim to issue a subpoena to a service
provider without first filing a lawsuit says nothing about whether courts should consider the interests of anonymous speakers
in the same way they would in other situations.

Bayside next argues that, to the extent MoneyBags has any First Amendment interest in this case, it is wholly accounted for
hrough copyright's fair use analysis, which allows the public to use copyrighted works in certain circumstances without
acing liability. As Bayside notes, while the First Amendment does not protect copyright infringement, ""copyright law contains
built-in First Amendment accommodations."" Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186 , 219-20, 123 S.Ct. 769 , 154 L.Ed.2d 683
(2003) . This has led some courts to eschew interest balancing in cases seeking to deanonymize alleged copyright
infringers. See In re DMCA Subpoena to Reddit, Inc. , 441 F. Supp. 3d 875, 882 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (noting that applying the
wo-step approach in the context

608 F.Supp.3d 878]

of a copyright dispute would be ""problematic"" because ""[t]he doctrine of fair use provides everything needed to balance the
competing interests of the First Amendment and the copyright laws""). But while it may be true that the fair use analysis
wholly encompasses free expression concerns in some cases, that is not true in all cases—and it is not true in a case like
his. That is because it is possible for a speaker's interest in anonymity to extend beyond the alleged infringement.

Consider a hypothetical not far afield from these facts. An anonymous blogger writes hundreds of blog posts criticizing a
powerful political figure, Mr. X. In one post, the blogger includes a copyrighted image owned by Mr. X. If Mr. X were to sue
or copyright infringement, the court would need to consider the interests on both sides—even if the blog post did not
constitute fair use. The blogger's interest in anonymity (with respect to Mr. X) may be so great as to outweigh Mr. X's interest
in enforcing his copyright. 3

c

Finally, Bayside argues that MoneyBags's absence dooms Twitter's motion. But although MoneyBags's presence would be
helpful, it is not necessary. There are many reasons why an anonymous speaker may fail to participate in litigation over their
right to remain anonymous. In some cases, it may be difficult (or impossible) to contact the speaker or confirm they received
notice of the dispute. Even where a speaker is alerted to the case, hiring a lawyer to move to quash a subpoena or litigate a
copyright claim can be very expensive. The speaker may opt to stop speaking, rather than assert their right to do so
anonymously. Indeed, there is some evidence that this is what happened here: MoneyBags has not tweeted since Twitter
was ordered to notify him of this dispute.

The Ninth Circuit has accordingly recognized that internet platforms can assert the First Amendment rights of their users,
based on the close relationship between the platform and its users and the ""genuine obstacles"" users face in asserting their
rights to anonymity._In re Grand Jury Subpoena, No. 16-03-217 , 875 F.3d 1179 , 1183 n.2 (9th Cir. 2017). As a platform that
permits anonymous posting, Twitter risks losing users if people learn that the company discloses users’ identities to anyone
who asks. Moreover, Twitter's interest in this dispute aligns with that of MoneyBags; both have an interest in protecting
MoneyBags's ability to speak his mind on Twitter without facing retaliation. Finally, there are genuine obstacles to
MoneyBags's participation, given the expense of litigation and the lack of a contrasting economic incentive in this suit. Cf.
Powers v. Ohio , 499 U.S. 400 , 415,111 S.Ct. 1364 , 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991) (""[T]here exist considerable practical barriers
to suits by the excluded juror because of the small financial stake involved and the economic burdens of litigation.""). To be
sure, MoneyBags may be better equipped to articulate his interest in maintaining anonymity in this context, but his failure to
appear does not prevent the Court from considering First Amendment interests when adjudicating the motion, as it would do
in a more typical case.

As explained above, to defeat Twitter's motion to quash, Bayside must first state a prima facie case of copyright
infringement.

[608 F.Supp.3d 879]

If it can do so, the Court must weigh the potential harm to Bayside if the subpoena is not enforced against the potential harm
to MoneyBags if his identity were revealed to Bayside.

A

Copying does not violate the copyright laws if it constitutes fair use. Although fair use is colloquially called an ""affirmative
defense"" to copyright liability, this is something of a misnomer because ""[flair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly
authorized by the law."" Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. , 815 F.3d 1145 , 1151-52 (9th Cir. 2016) ;see 17 U.S.C. § 107 (""
[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work ... is not an infringement of copyright.""). To make a prima facie case of copyright
infringement for the purposes of obtaining a subpoena, then, a party must make a prima facie case that the infringing use did
not constitute fair use. In some cases, no analysis is required; it is obvious, for example, that downloading and distributing
copyrighted music via peer-to-peer systems does not constitute fair use. See Sony Music Entertainment Inc. v. Does 1-40_.
326 F. Supp. 2d 556 , 565-66 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). But in other cases, a mere description of the copying raises serious
questions of fair use. See, e.g., In re DMCA Subpoena to Reddit, Inc. , 441 F. Supp. 3d 875, 884 (N.D. Cal. 2020). This may
require the copyright owner to offer evidence to make a prima facie case.

The copyright statute lays out four non-exclusive factors for evaluating whether a use constitutes non-infringing fair use.
Courts are to consider:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. § 107. The fair use analysis is fact intensive; courts are to ""eschew ‘bright-line rules’ and ‘categories of
presumptively fair use,’ and instead engage in a ‘case-by-case analysis.’ "" Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. v. ComicMix LLC
983 F.3d 443 , 451 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569 , 577, 584,114 S.Ct. 1164 ,
127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ). All four factors are ""to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of
copyright."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164.

1. Begin with the ""purpose and character of the use."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). In addition to considering the purpose of the use
(whether, for example, it ""is for criticism, or comment, or news reporting""), this factor asks whether the new work ""adds
something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.""
Campbell__510 U.S. at 578 —79, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Put another way, this factor asks ""whether and to what extent the new
work is ‘transformative.’ "" /d. (quoting Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard , 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1111 (1990) ).

The use here—tweets by an unverified Twitter account with a small following that only garnered a handful of likes, retweets,
or comments—is not commercial, a fact that ""tips the scales in favor of fair use."" Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc. , —
U.S. , 141 S. Ct. 1183 1204, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021) . What's more, the use is transformative. Considered on their own,
the copyrighted photos may have aesthetic value. But MoneyBags was not using the photos for their artistry.

[608 F.Supp.3d 880]

Rather, by placing the pictures in the context of comments about Sheth, MoneyBags gave the photos a new meaning—an
expression of the author's apparent distaste for the lifestyle and moral compass of one-percenters. This transformation fits
squarely within Section 107 ’s examples of fair use, particularly ""criticism"" and ""comment."" See Seltzer v. Green Day, Inc.
725 F.3d 1170 , 1177 (9th Cir. 2013) (""[A]n allegedly infringing work is typically viewed as transformative as long as new
expressive content or message is apparent,” even where the work ""makes few physical changes to the original or fails to
comment on the original.""); Katz v. Google Inc. , 802 F.3d 1178 , 1182-83 (11th Cir. 2015).

2. The second fair use factor—the nature of the copyrighted work—""recognizes that creative works are ‘closer to the core of
intended copyright protection’ than informational and functional works."" Dr. Suess Enterprises__983 F.3d at 455 (quoting Dr.
Seuss Enterprises, L.P. v. Penguin Books USA, Inc. , 109 F.3d 1394 , 1402 (9th Cir. 1997) ). As a result, ""fair use is more
difficult to establish when the former works are copied."" /d. (quoting Penguin Books__109 F.3d at 1402 ). In evaluating this
factor, courts also consider whether the copied work was previously published. /d.

Bayside states that its photos were ""first published in 2017 and 2020."" 4 The fact that the photos were already published at

the time of the copying weighs in favor of fair use. See Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp. , 336 F.3d 811 , 820 (9th Cir. 2003). Also
weighing in favor of fair use is the fact that many of the photos appear to be candid shots in a public setting—the type of



--- Page 5 ---
picture one would post to their Facebook or Instagram. See Katz_._802 F.3d at 1183 .

On the other hand, a couple of the photos are somewhat more artistic. One photo, for example, depicts a woman standing in
front of a mirror taking a selfie with her phone. The shot is taken by a third party, rather than the woman herself, and the
lighting, positioning, and wardrobe appear to have been intentionally selected. Another photo is a self-portrait that, charitably
construed, may have involved creative positioning of the subject's hair and deliberately applied makeup. That said, Bayside
has made no attempt to provide evidence that the photographer ""attempted to convey ideas, emotions, or in any way
influence [the subject's] pose, expression, or clothing."" /d. (Indeed, Bayside has not provided any information about the
photographs, including who the photographer is, where the photos were taken, or the identity of the woman they feature.) At
best, the second factor may tilt slightly in favor of Bayside due to the artistic elements of these latter photographs, although
the factor is largely inconclusive.

3. The third factor considers the ""amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a
whole."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). This factor is not particularly helpful in the context of a photograph or drawing that ""is not
meaningfully divisible,"" as the entire

[608 F.Supp.3d 881]

work must be used to preserve any meaning at all. Seltzer_725 F.3d at 1178 ; see also Katz_._802 F.3d at 1183 —84. This
factor is therefore neutral.

4. The fourth and final factor asks what effect the use has ""upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" §
107(4). Analysis of this factor requires courts to consider ""not only the extent of the market harm caused by the particular
actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the
defendant would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market"" for the original and derivative works. Dr.
Seuss Enterprises . 983 F.3d at 458 (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164).

When a use is transformative and non-commercial, it is difficult to infer market harm. In such a case, ""it is more likely that the
new work will not affect the market for the original in a way cognizable under this factor, that is, by acting as a substitute for
it."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . To make a prima facie case of copyright infringement in this context,
Bayside must offer some explanation for how its financial interests in the copyrights could be harmed by a use like the
tweets at issue here.

Bayside offers that it is a ""communications and strategic advisory firm"" that ""licenses photographs for commercial
exploitation."" But beyond this vague explanation of its business model, Bayside nowhere explains what the potential market
for these licenses is, let alone how that market could be impacted by tweets like MoneyBags's. Further, Bayside's
explanation of its business is hard to accept at face value given the suspicious circumstances surrounding this motion (more
on that later). And Bayside declined an opportunity (offered at the hearing) to supplement the record with actual evidence of
market harm. This factor therefore weighs in favor of fair use.

ake

Taking into account all of these factors, Bayside has not established a prima facie case of copyright infringement.
B

Even if Bayside had made a prima facie showing of copyright infringement, the subpoena would still need to be quashed
because the balance of equities tilts in MoneyBags's favor.

Considering ""the nature of the speech"" at issue, there is no question that significant First Amendment interests are at stake.
In re Anonymous Online Speakers , 661 F.3d 1168 , 1177 (9th Cir. 2011). The six tweets flagged by Bayside are best
interpreted as vaguely satirical commentary criticizing the opulent lifestyle of wealthy investors generally (and Brian Sheth,
specifically). For example, one tweet reads: ""Good morning from Mrs. Brian Sheth #2. Life is good when you're a 44-year old
private equity billionaire."" The tweet accuses Brian Sheth of having a mistress and links his infidelity to the broader class of
""private equity billionaires,"" suggesting that wealth (or working in private equity) corrupts. Unmasking MoneyBags thus risks
exposing him to ""economic or official retaliation"" by Sheth or his associates. Mcintyre v. Ohio Elections Commission , 514
U.S. 334 , 341-42, 115 S.Ct. 1511 , 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) . And MoneyBags's interest in anonymity is heightened further
by his other tweets, which discuss issues of political importance such as sexual harassment, tax enforcement, and corporate
regulations.

This is where the mystery surrounding Bayside makes a difference. If the Court were assured that Bayside had no
connection to Brian Sheth, a limited disclosure

[608 F.Supp.3d 882]

subject to a protective order could perhaps be appropriate. But the circumstances of this subpoena are suspicious. As far as
the Court can tell, Bayside was not formed until the month that the tweets about Sheth were posted on Twitter. It appears
that Bayside had never registered any copyrights until the registration of these six photographs, which happened after the
tweets were posted. And there appears to be no information publicly available about Bayside's principals, staff, physical
location, formation, or purposes.


--- Page 6 ---
Rather than explaining these puzzling facts, Bayside's counsel simply filed a declaration stating that ""Bayside is not and has
not ever been owned or controlled by Brian Sheth."" The declaration also notes that Brian Sheth does not own, and has not
ever owned, ""any interest in the copyrights to the Photographs."" 2 Even setting aside the fact that this declaration came from
counsel, rather than a party with personal knowledge of its veracity, it raises more questions than it answers. Is Bayside
owned or controlled by someone associated with Brian Sheth? Was Bayside formed in response to these tweets? How did
Bayside come to acquire these copyrights, and from whom? When pressed at the hearing, Bayside's counsel, Lawrence
Hadley, would not (or could not) expand on these vague assertions.

Mr. Hadley: | can say that—that the subject of the tweets has no ownership interest in Bayside. This is all set
forth in an affidavit.

The Court: ... [D]oes the subject of the tweets—Mr. Sheth, does he know anybody who is connected [to]
Bayside?

Mr. Hadley: | don't know. | don't know who the person is, and | don't know who they know.

The Court: Okay. Who—can you name a person who is connected to this company called Bayside? Can you
name—can you give me some names of people who operate or work for Bayside?

Mr. Hadley: My client contact is a person named Mr. Kaufman.
Dkt. No. 52 at 48.

Of course, even a weighty First Amendment interest may give way in the face of a strong interest on the other side. But here
too, the Court is left scratching its head. It is not clear what Bayside has to gain from pursuing a copyright action against
MoneyBags. Injunctive relief is unavailable, as Twitter has already taken the photos down. Because Bayside registered the
copyrights after the alleged infringement, it appears as though Bayside could recover only limited damages that are unlikely
to cover the considerable expense of pursuing its copyright claims and no attorney fees. See 17 U.S.C. § 412. And as
discussed in the preceding section, Bayside has offered no information on the market harm it could conceivably have
suffered as a result of the postings. All Bayside has offered in support of its identity are a few vague descriptions of its
services—claiming it is a ""communications and strategic advisory firm"" that ""licenses photographs for commercial
exploitation."" A visit to Bayside's website (which the Court conducted with Bayside's counsel present during the hearing)
revealed a shell of a site with no information about Bayside, what it does, who owns the company, who works for the
company, or how any customer could license the photographs the company allegedly owns. See Bayside Advisory LLC ,
https://baysideadvisory.com [https://perma.cc/26DU-3NNT] (captured May 16, 2022).

[608 F.Supp.3d 883]

Given all the unknowns, at oral argument the Court offered Bayside an opportunity to supplement the record with an
evidentiary hearing or additional documentation. Bayside declined, stating that it preferred the motion to be adjudicated on
the current record. There would perhaps be some benefit in insisting on an evidentiary hearing to explore the circumstances
behind this subpoena—to explore whether Bayside and its counsel are abusing the judicial process in an effort to discover
MoneyBags's identity for reasons having nothing to do with copyright law. Perhaps that hearing could even result in an
award of attorney's fees for Twitter. But Twitter stated that it too prefers not to have an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, the
record will stand, and the people connected to this mysterious company will succeed in preserving their own anonymity. But
Bayside's choice not to supplement the record makes it quite easy to balance MoneyBags's interest in preserving his
anonymity against Bayside's alleged interest in protecting its apparent copyrights. On this record, even if Bayside had made
a prima facie showing of copyright infringement, the Court would quash the subpoena in a heartbeat.

ake

Twitter's motion to quash is granted and Bayside's motion to compel is denied.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

Notes:

1 October 19: ""The new Mrs. Brian Sheth at the top of Beverly Hills."" October 20: ""Life is good when you are Brian Sheth. #NoTax ... #Babes
#PrivateJet."" October 21: ""Brian Sheth is the best investor in private equity. This is how he spends his money. | would say this is a good investment!""
October 22: ""Good morning from Mrs. Brian Sheth #2. Life is good when you're a 44-year old private equity billionaire... #Billionaire #Upgrade #Sexy.""
October 28: ""Brian Sheth is the King of Private Equity.... #Babes #LadiesMan.""

2 Bayside argues that Twitter's motion to quash must be denied because it was filed too late. Under the Federal Rules, a motion to quash must be
""timely"" filed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(A). ""Courts generally agree that a motion to quash under Rule 45 is timely if made before the date specified for
compliance with the subpoena."" Handloser v. HCL America, Inc. , 2020 WL 4700989, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2020). But where (as here) a subpoena
recipient moves to quash after lodging a written objection to the subpoena, the motion to quash is timely so long as it is filed within a reasonable time
after the conclusion of informal efforts to resolve the objections. See Friedman v. Old Republic Home Protection Co., Inc. , 2014 WL 12845131, at *2
(C.D. Cal. June 24, 2014) (""It is not appropriate ... to rob [a party] of the opportunity to move to quash the subpoena because its good faith efforts to


--- Page 7 ---
resolve the matter outside of Court made its request untimely under some decisions interpreting Rule 45."").

3 This concern still exists where the copyright owner and the subject of the anonymous speech are different people, but it can sometimes be alleviated by
a court order requiring that the speaker's identity remain anonymous on the docket and that the party serving the subpoena not disclose the identity to
any third party.

4|n what will emerge as a theme of this ruling, Bayside's assertion is not without doubt: Bayside notes the alleged publication dates in its opposition to
Twitter's motion to quash, without any accompanying declaration. Normally the Court would decline to credit this unsupported assertion, but because it is
not outcome determinative, its truth will be assumed for purposes of this motion (and this motion only). The Court interprets Bayside's phrasing (noting
that the photographs were first published in 2017 and 2020) as implying that all the photos were published before they were tweeted by MoneyBags.
This is the first (of many) issues where further evidentiary support from Bayside would have been helpful.

8 Bayside makes these same claims about Robert Smith and Bob Brockman—two associates of Brian Sheth who are also mentioned in some of
MoneyBags's tweets.

BACKGROUND

Dow Jones is a global provider of news and _ business
information. (Dkt. #45 at 1.) Two of its publications include
The Wall Street Journal (“WSJ”) and Barron's, which are
published in both print and digital formats. (Id.) Dow Jones
allows its subscribers to print or download articles for
personal use located on the WS/ and Barron's digital site.
(Dkt. # 1 at 6.) However, Dow Jones requires its subscribers
and non-subscribers to pay a fee for a license to distribute
a reprint of any WSJ or Barron's article to more than a few
individuals, regardless of whether the licensee or recipients of
the reprints are subscribers or whether the emails distributing
the reprints are opened. (Id. at 5.)

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. v. Harris, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

Defendant Britton Harris is an investment manager and
professor. (Dkt. # 1 at 2.) From December 2006 to June
2017, Harris was the Chief Investment Officer (“CIO”) at
the Teacher Retirement System of Texas (“TRS”), managing
the state's pension plan for public teachers. (Dkt. # 46 at
2.) From July 2017 to June 2023, Harris was the Chief
Executive Officer (“CEO”) and CIO of the University
of Texas Investment Management Company (“UTIMCO”),
which manages the investments of the University of Texas
and Texas A&M University systems. (Id.) In 2023, Harris
retired from UTIMCO and currently serves as CEO and CIO
of the Texas Permanent School Fund through his personal
investment restoration service called On Eagles Wings. (Id.)

In 2006, Harris began teaching as a professor at Texas
A&M University. (Dkt. # 46 at 3.) He developed a course
titled Titans of Investing (“Titans”), which aimed to prepare
students to be involved in the elite world of business. (Id.
at 2.) In 2016 and 2018, Harris expanded this course to
Baylor University and the University of Texas, respectively.
(Id.) Harris has taught over 900 students in the Titans course
over the years. (Id.) In 2012, Harris also expanded the Titans
course outside of the university environment to members of
his Austin-based church. (Id. at 3.)

As part of his Titans curriculum, Harris believes it is important
for his Titans students to read current events. (Id. at 4.)
Harris started a “Reading With Britt” email program (“RWB
Emails”). (Id.) The RWB Emails entailed a list of daily
articles for his students to read. The topics varied from day
to day based upon a schedule Harris developed himself. The
schedule includes the following: on Mondays, a review of
the previous week; on Tuesdays a focus on America; on
Wednesdays, a focus on Japan and Europe; on Thursday,
emerging markets and alternative investments, and on Friday,
life and general interest. (Id.; Dkt. # 1 at 9.) An example of a
daily RWB Email can be seen below:

The Disucine inetablinco Cvberattacis

(Dkt. # 45, Ex. G.)

To circulate the RWB Emails, Harris enlisted the help of his
personal Executive Assistant, Sharon Toalson. (Dkt. #46, Ex.
2.) The process to prepare the daily RWB Emails included
the following: (1) Harris identifying articles he intended to
include in the daily RWB Email; (2) sending an email with
links to the articles to his assistant(s); (3) the assistant saving
each article as a PDF through the print icon on the websites;
(4) creating a “single electronic file” that consisted of a saved
version of the online articles in the order listed in the email
table; (5) creating a table listing each of the included articles
and their respective publications; (6) adding in the hyperlink
to the articles in the table to include in the RWB Email;
and finally (7) forwarding the complete RWB Email to the
distribution list. (Id.; Dkt. #45, Ex. F.)

The RWB Emails were initially only sent to Titans students.
But once those students graduated or moved on from Harris’
Titans course, those individuals stayed on the RWB Email
distribution list. (Dkt. # 46 at 4.) While Harris was serving
as the CEO at the TRS, he began to include TRS employees
in the same RWB Email distribution list as his former and
current Titans students. (Dkt. #45 at 11.) When Harris started
working at UTIMCO, he included UTIMCO employees in his
RWB Emails list. (Id.) To date, the RWB Email distribution
list contains 1,000 individuals, ranging from former Titans
students to TRS and UTIMCO employees. (Id. at 4.)

On May 25, 2020, Dow Jones received an unsolicited email
from Edward Bradley informing it of Harris’ RWB Emails
and potential copyright infringement. (Dkts. ## 1 at 13; 45
at 9-10.) Upon receiving this notice, Dow Jones contacted
Harris and informed him of his alleged infringing activities.
Id. Harris thereafter stopped circulating RWB Emails with


--- Page 3 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. v. Harris, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

attached PDFs of the articles, and instead started circulating
his emails with links directly to the articles. (Dkt. # 46 at 5.)

On June 10, 2022, Dow Jones filed the instant lawsuit
against Harris alleging copyright infringement, violation
of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), and
breach of contract. (Dkt. # 1 at 14-18.) Specifically,
Dow Jones alleges, “[f]rom October 2010 to July 2020,
Harris directed the wholesale copying and distribution of at
least 6,186 Dow Jones Copyrighted Works verbatim from
WSJ.com and Barrons.com [ ] to between 1,000 and 1,200
business professionals as PDF attachments to the RWB
[Emails].” (Dkt. # 45 at 4.) Both parties have moved for
summary judgment on these claims. (Dkts. ## 45, 46.)

LEGAL STANDARD

“Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine
dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” Griggs v. Brewer, 841 F.3d 308,
311-12 (Sth Cir. 2016); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “A
genuine dispute of material fact exists ‘if the evidence is such
that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving
party.’ ” Johnson v. World All. Fin. Corp., 830 F.3d 192, 195
(5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477
USS. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). The
moving party “bears the initial responsibility of informing

the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying
those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate
the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” E.E.O.C. v.
LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 694 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548,
91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). While the movant must demonstrate
the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact, it does not
need to negate the elements of the nonmovant's case. Little
v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1076 n.16 (Sth Cir. 1994).
A fact is material if it “might affect the outcome of the suit.”
Thomas v. Tregre, 913 F.3d 458, 462 (Sth Cir. 2019) (citing
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct.
2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).

DISCUSSION

WESTLAW

*3 Plaintiff moves for judgment as a matter of law on its
copyright infringement and breach of contract claims. (Dkt.
# 45 at 6.) Defendant moves for summary judgment on
the copyright infringement, DMCA, and breach of contract
claims. (Dkt. # 46 at 1.)

I. Copyright Infringement
Section 106 of the Copyright Act confers a bundle of

exclusive rights to the owner of a copyright, including the
right “to publish, copy, and distribute the author's work.”
Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S.
539, 547, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). But these
rights are subject to “certain statutory exceptions,” including

the “privilege of other authors to make ‘fair use’ of an earlier
author's work.” Id. (citing 17 U.S.C. § 107).

A. Infringement
Dow Jones argues it is entitled to judgment as a matter

of law on its copyright infringement claim because there
is no dispute of material fact that it owns valid copyright
registrations for at least 5,371 copyrighted works registered
with the U.S. Copyright Office. (Dkt. # 45 at 6.) Further,
direct evidence shows that Harris created identical, or nearly
identical, copies of the Dow Jones copyrighted works and
distributed them without permission from Dow Jones. (Id.)

“A copyright infringement action requires the plaintiff to
prove ownership of a valid copyright and copying by the
defendant.” Norma Ribbon & Trimming, Inc. v. Little, 51
F.3d 45, 47 (Sth Cir. 1995). Ownership is established by
proving the originality and copyrightability of the material
and compliance with statutory formalities. Allied Mktg. Grp.,
Inc. v. CDL Mktg., Inc., 878 F.2d 806, 811 (Sth Cir. 1989).
Copying is generally established by proving that the alleged
infringer had access to the copyrighted materials and that

the copyrighted material and allegedly infringing material are
substantially similar. Norma Ribbon, 51 F.3d at 47.

It is undisputed that Dow Jones has valid copyrights for 91
group registrations of sets of magazine and newspaper issues,
21 certificates for group registrations of database updates,
and 36 certificates for registrations of single issues. (Dkt.
# 21 at 10.) Certain WSJ and Barron's articles fall within
these copyright certificates and are entitled to copyright
protection. It is also undisputed that Harris had access to the


--- Page 4 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. v. Harris, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

copyrighted materials through his digital subscriptions to WSJ
and Barron's, and such subscriptions have continued to be
renewed since 2010. (Dkt. # 45, Ex. P; Ex. B at 2.)

The Court finds the evidence shows Harris made identical,
or nearly identical, copies of Dow Jones's copyrighted works
in his RWB Emails by downloading and attaching PDFs
of protected articles. The evidence is also undisputed that
Harris circulated identical copies or portions of Dow Jones's
copyrighted works to hundreds of recipients in the RWB
Email list over many years without paying the requisite
licensing fee. (Dkt. # 46, Ex. 1 at 2.) Harris does not dispute
this conduct. Therefore, Dow Jones established as a matter of
law that Defendant engaged in copyright infringement.

However, the inquiry does not end there. Harris argues Dow
Jones's copyright infringement claims still fail as a matter of
law because his alleged “unpaid, noncommercial, educational
distribution” of his RWB Emails was a fair use. (Dkt. # 46
at 7.)

B. Fair Use
*4 “Any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work
for a ‘fair use.’ ” Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City
Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d
574 (1984). Section 107 of the Copyright Act codified this
exception and states that “the fair use of a copyrighted
work ... for purposes such as criticism, comment, news

reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom
use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of
copyright.” 17 U.S.C. § 107. Fair use is an affirmative defense
that “can excuse what would otherwise be an infringing use of
copyrighted material.” Cambridge Univ. Press v. Patton, 769
F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir. 2014); Estate of Barré v. Carter,
272 F. Supp. 3d 906, 929 (E.D. La. 2017). In determining
whether the use of a work is fair use, courts consider:

(1) [T]he purpose and character of the use, including
whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for
nonprofit educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

WESTLAW

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. § 107.

The four factors are nonexclusive and are weighed together.
Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 578, 114
S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994); Harper & Row, 471
U.S. at 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218. Fair use is a mixed question of
law and fact that requires a case-by-case determination as to

whether a particular use of a copyrighted work is a fair use.
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577, 114 S.Ct. 1164; Harper & Row,
471 US. at 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218. “[I]t may be resolved on
summary judgment if a reasonable trier of fact could reach
only one conclusion—but not otherwise.” Peteski Prods., Inc.
v. Rothman, 264 F. Supp. 3d 731, 734 (E.D. Tex. 2017)
(quoting Ty, Inc. v. Publ'ns Int'l Ltd., 292 F.3d 512, 516—
17 (7th Cir. 2002)). “[W]here the district court has [f]acts
sufficient to evaluate each of the statutory factors, it may
conclude as a matter of law that the challenged use is not a
protected fair use.” Id. (quoting Castle Rock Entm't v. Carol
Publ'g. Grp.. Inc., 955 F. Supp. 260, 267 (S.D.N.Y. 1997),
affid, 150 F.3d 132 (2d Cir. 1998)).

i. Purpose and Character of the Use

For the first factor, courts often consider “the culpability of a
defendant's conduct in acquiring or using a work, the extent
to which such use is transformative, and whether such use is
for commercial or non-commercial purposes.” Peteski Prods.,
264 F. Supp. 3d at 736. The focus of this factor is “whether and
to what extent the new work is ‘transformative.’ ” Campbell,
510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. In determining whether
a use is transformative, courts evaluate “whether the new
work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation ...
or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or
different character, altering the first with new expression,
meaning, or message.” Peteski Prods., 264 F. Supp. 3d at 739
(quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164).

It is uncontested that Harris downloaded Dow Jones articles
verbatim and sent those articles to the RWB Email list.
But Harris claims those RWB Emails were circulated for
nonprofit educational purposes. (Dkt. # 46 at 8.) The Court
agrees that the origination and use of the RWB Emails


--- Page 5 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. v. Harris, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

specifically for the Titans course falls under an educational
purpose. Indeed, Dow Jones explains, “[t]his lawsuit does not
involve Harris’ conduct as a professor or the distribution of
RWB Newsletters to then-enrolled university students.” (Dkt
#45 at 12,n. 17.) Thus, the RWB Emails sent to current Titans
students at the time they were in the course likely falls under
fair use.

*5 However, the issue is that Harris decided to send those
same RWB Emails containing copyrighted works to hundreds
of TRS and UTIMCO employees over the years, who had no
connection to the Titans course. (Dkt. # 45 at 10-11.) In fact,
Harris concedes he sent the RWB Emails to “a smattering of
other people [who] just asked for it.” (Dkt. # 45, Ex. A. at 42.)

The Court agrees that Harris circulated the RWB Emails
for nonprofit purposes. (Dkt. # 46 at 9.) The evidence is
undisputed that Harris did not charge recipients to receive
the RWB Emails or receive revenue at any time. (Dkts. ##
1, Ex. 1 at 2; 47 at 14.) Harris maintains “he was teaching
business students and fostering nonfiction habits for people
engaged in the real world.” (Dkt. # 50 at 11.) This purpose
was not refuted by the evidence and was corroborated by
Harris’ evidence that he urged RWB Email recipients to
subscribe to the publications at issue. (See Dkt. # 46, Ex.
2-3 at 2.) Therefore, the Court finds the purpose behind the
RWB Emails containing PDF copies of Plaintiff's copyrighted
works was for nonprofit educational purposes. However, the
Supreme Court has held that “the mere fact that a use is
educational and not for profit does not insulate it from a
finding of infringement.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 584, 114
S.Ct. 1164; see also Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City
Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 450, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d
574 (1984) (“Even copying for noncommercial purposes may
impair the copyright holder's ability to obtain the rewards that
Congress intended him to have.”).

As for the transformative nature, Harris claims his RWB
Emails containing the PDF articles were transformative
because they “conveyed his unique conception of what news
of the week was worthy of his audience's study.” (Dkt. # 46
at 10.) Dow Jones argues that simply gathering copyrighted
works into a new document is not a transformative use, even
when that compilation seeks to convey a message, such as
which works are best. (Dkt. # 47 at 13.)

WESTLAW

The Court agrees with Dow Jones. The general purpose of
the RWB Emails was to share news articles worthy of study
and to inform recipients apprised of what is going on in
the world. (Dkts. ## 46 at 10; 47, Ex. B at 3.) In other
words, Harris decided to distribute WSJ and Barron's articles,
among others, to his RWB Email distribution list to share
information on current events he thought were important. This
does not add anything new to the nature of the articles. Dow
Jones's purpose in publishing its articles is also to inform
the public about newsworthy events across the world that it
deems important. (Dkt. #47, Ex. A at 4.) Therefore, this factor
weighs against fair use.

ii. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

When courts evaluate the second factor, they consider two
distinct inquiries. First, “highly creative or fictional works are
generally afforded ‘maximal protection, and hence it is less
likely that use of such works will be fair use.’ ” Peteski Prods.,
264 F. Supp. 3d at 740 (quoting Patton, 769 F.3d at 1268).
“The law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate

factual works than works of fiction or fantasy.” Harper &
Row, 471 U.S. at 563, 105 S.Ct. 2218

Harris claims in sending the articles, he was sharing the “ideas
and facts contained in his reading list, neither of which are
protected under copyright law.” (Dkt. # 46 at 11-12.)

The Court finds that Harris did more than merely share
the “ideas and facts” contained in the articles reading list.
He copied and forwarded the articles to colleagues without
paying the requisite licensing fee for non-personal use. If
Harris only intended to share the underlying facts and ideas
within the articles, it likely would have been that Harris shared
summaries of the underlying facts contained therein, rather
than a compilation of verbatim copies of the articles.

*6 Even though news articles are factual in nature, |
have concluded wholesale copying and redistribution of news
reports is not a fair use. See, e.g., Fox News Network.
LLC v. TVEyes, Inc., 883 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2018)
(citing Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202, 220
(2d Cir. 2015)) (“Those who report the news undoubtedly
create factual works. It cannot seriously be argued that, for

courts



--- Page 6 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. v. Harris, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

that reason, others may freely copy and re-disseminate news
reports.”) Therefore, this factor weighs against fair use.

iii. Amount and Substantiality of the Portions Used

In considering the amount and substantiality of the portions
used, courts “examine both the quantitative and qualitative
aspects of the portion of the copyrighted material taken.”
Monge v. Maya Magazines, Inc., 688 F.3d 1164, 1178 (9th
Cir. 2012) (citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586, 114S.Ct. 1164).
“While wholesale copying does not preclude fair use per se,

copying an entire work militates against a finding of fair use.”
Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811, 820 (9th Cir. 2003).
That said, “the extent of permissible copying varies with the
purpose and character of the use.” Bill Graham Archives v.
Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605, 613 (2d Cir. 2006)
(citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586-87, 114 S.Ct. 1164).

Here, Harris copied the articles verbatim. This is evident
through his instructions to his assistants to print the articles
directly from WSJ and Barron's and attach them to the daily
emails. (Dkt. # 46, Ex. 2-1, 2-2.) No changes were made
to the articles other than the process of compiling them
together into a PDF to be included in the RWB Emails.
Both qualitatively and quantitatively, Harris unreasonably
reproduced the articles. Accordingly, this factor weighs
against fair use.

iv. The Effect on the Works’ Potential Market or Value

Finally, courts consider “the effect of the use upon the
potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.”
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590, 114'S.Ct. 1164 (quoting 17 U.S.C.
§ 107(4)). “This last factor is undoubtedly the single most
important element of fair use.” Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at
566, 105 S.Ct. 2218. Analysis of this factor “requires courts
to consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the
particular actions of the alleged infringer,” but also “whether
unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by
the defendant would result in a substantially adverse impact
on the potential market for the original.” Campbell, 510
U.S. at 590, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (cleaned up). Put differently, the
inquiry “must take account not only of harm to the original

WESTLAW

but also of harm to the market for derivative works.” Harper
& Row, 471 U.S. at 567, 105 S.Ct. 2218.

This factor presumptively weighs in the plaintiff's favor if
the use is commercial, because “every commercial use of
copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation
of the monopoly privilege that belongs to the owner of the
copyright.” Balsley v. LFP, Inc., 691 F.3d 747, 760 (6th Cir.
2012) (quoting Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios.
Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 451, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574
(1984)). However, when the “second use is transformative,
market substitution is at least less certain, and market harm

may not be so readily inferred.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at
591, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Courts have described this factor as
“concerned with secondary uses that, by offering a substitute
for the original, usurp a market that properly belongs to the
copyright holder.” Nunez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp., 235
F.3d 18, 24 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Infinity Broad. Corp. v.
Kirkwood, 150 F.3d 104, 110 (2d Cir. 1998)).

*7 Harris claims he made no commercial advantage from
disseminating the articles in his daily emails. The evidence
demonstrates he did not directly monetarily profit from his
RWB emails. However, that is not the sole question. The
Court must also look to the impact of the market for Dow
Jones's copyrighted works. See L.A. Times v. Free Republic,
No. CV 98-7840 MMM(AJWX), 2000 WL 565200, at *21
(C.D. Cal. Apr. 4, 2000); Emmerich Newspapers, Inc. v.
Particle Media, Inc., No. 3:21-CV-32-KHJ-MTP, 2022 WL
3222892, at *5 (S.D. Miss. Aug. 9, 2022) (“Verbatim copying
of articles has potential to interfere with Emmerich's market
for online article viewership.”).

Even if inadvertent or in good faith, Harris’ circulations of
wholesale copies of articles obviated any need for recipients
to visit the WSJ or Barron's sites to seek the original work.
Over the years, Harris circulated copies of over 6,186 Dow
Jones articles, for which Dow Jones claims at least 5,371 were
entitled to copyright protection through valid United States
copyright group registrations. (Dkt. # 45 at 17.) Thus, the
RWB Emails attaching the articles directly superseded the
copyrighted material. Indeed, Dow Jones provided evidence
that some RWB Email recipients relied solely on the PDF
copies of the articles to read through the RWB Emails rather
than purchasing “full subscription access” to the publications.
(See, e.g., Dkt. #47, Exs. R, S, T.) Moreover, the distribution
of the PDF copies of the articles for non-personal use deprived


--- Page 7 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. v. Harris, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

Dow Jones of its licensing fees for such use. Accordingly, this
factor weighs against fair use.

Therefore, the Court finds that Harris’ use of the Dow Jones
copyrighted materials is not exempt by fair use. Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Dow Jones's Motion for Summary
Judgment on the copyright infringement claim and DENIES
Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on the same
claim.

C. Statutory Damages

A prevailing party in a copyright infringement claim is
entitled to either actual damages or statutory damages. 17
U.S.C. § 504(a). As for statutory damages, the Copyright Act
provides in pertinent part: “Except as provided by clause (2)
of this subsection, the copyright owner may elect, at any time
before final judgment is rendered, to recover, instead of actual
damages and profits, an award of statutory damages for all
infringements involved in the action, with respect to any one
work, for which any one infringer is liable individually, or
for which any two or more infringers are liable jointly and
severally, in a sum of not less than $750 or more than $30,000
as the court considers just. For the purposes of this subsection,
all the parts of a compilation or derivative work constitute one
work.” 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1).

As previously ordered by the Court, Dow Jones's requests
for statutory damages, if any, are limited to a per-issue basis,
not a per-article basis. (Dkt. # 25 at 3) (adopting Dkt. # 21.)
Therefore, Dow Jones is required to identify the basis of its
damages for its relief on its copyright infringement claims,
including the exact number of affected copyrighted issues, not
articles. If Dow Jones intends to pursue statutory damages
available under § 504(c)(1), it will accordingly be limited as
previously ordered.

IL. Digital Millenium Copyright Act

A plaintiff must allege the following to plead a claim under
§ 1202(b) of the DMCA: “(1) the existence of [copyright
management information (“CMI”)] in connection with a
copyrighted work; and (2) that a defendant ‘distribute[d] ...
works [or] copies of works’; (3) while ‘knowing that
[CMI] has been removed or altered without authority of the
copyright owner or the law’; and (4) while ‘knowing, or ...
having reasonable grounds to know’ that such distribution

WESTLAW

oer

‘will induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement.
Mango v. BuzzFeed, Inc., 970 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir. 2020).

*8 The Fifth Circuit defines CMI broadly. Energy
Intelligence Group, Inc. v. Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors.
L.P., 948 F.3d 261, 277 (Sth Cir. 2020). It is “any of the
following information conveyed in connection with copies ...

of a work,” including “[t]he title and other information
identifying the work,” 17 U.S.C. § 1202(c)(1); “[t]he name
of, and other identifying information about,” the author,
copyright owner, or performer, Id. § 1202(c)(2)-(4); or
“{s]uch other information as the Register of Copyrights may
prescribe by regulation,” id. § 1202(c)(8).

Dow Jones alleges Harris also removed or altered a variety of
CMI conveyed in connection with the Dow Jones copyrighted
works, including publication names, bylines, headlines,
copyright notices, reproduction warnings, and file names.
(Dkt. # 1 at 11.) However, Dow Jones does not bring a motion
for summary judgment on its DMCA claims. Harris moves
for summary judgment on these claims on the basis that Dow
Jones has no evidence he intentionally removed or altered
Dow Jones's CMI. (Dkt. # 46 at 14.)

Harris argues Dow Jones must prove he have had actual
knowledge that CMI (1) had been removed or altered without
authority, as well as (2) actual or constructive knowledge that
such removal or alteration would “induce, enable, facilitate,
or conceal an infringement.” Zuma Press, Inc. v. Getty Images
(USA), Inc., 845 Fed. Appx. 54, 57-58 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting
Mango, 970 F.3d at 171). Because Dow Jones has no evidence
to support this requirement, Harris contends he is subject to
judgment as a matter of law. (Dkt. # 46 at 15.)

Dow Jones argues that Harris must have knowingly removed
the CMI from the articles to create his emails because some
of the PDF articles in certain RWB Emails do not contain
some of its CMI. (Dkt. # 46, Ex. 3 at 10.) However, Section
1202 does not cover the mere failure to add truthful CMI
to a copy. See Huffman v. Activision Publ'g, Inc., No. 2:19-
CV-00050-RWSRSP, 2020 WL 8678493, at *11 (E.D. Tex.
Dec. 14, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, No.
2:19-CV-00050-RWSRSP, 2021 WL 2141352 (E.D. Tex.
May 26, 2021) (granting summary judgment because Plaintiff
lacked any evidence to support an essential part of his section
1202(b) claim).



--- Page 8 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. v. Harris, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

Dow Jones provides no evidence that Harris ever intentionally
or knowingly altered the CMI associated with the WSJ or
Barron's articles. Defendant, on the other hand, provided
declarations stating those involved in creating the RWB
Emails never knowingly or intentionally made any deletions
or alterations to any article attached to the RWB Emails. (Dkt.
#46, Ex. | and Ex. 2.) Moreover, the evidence shows Harris
never instructed his assistant, Sharon Toalson, or any other
person to do so. (Id. at Ex. 2-1.) In the “Reading With Britt”
Memorandum that details the process to create a RWB email,
the instructions do not include methods that would remove
or alter of CMI. (Dkt. # 46, Ex. 2-1.) In fact, the instructions
direct those to print directly from websites using the print
icon on the article and to directly “copy article address” and
paste next to the Publication name in the email table. (Id.)
Further, the instructions do not mention any change in article
name, any removal of CMI affiliated with each article, or
withholding of publication names.

To the extent any CMI—in the form of publication names,
bylines, headlines, copyright notices, reproduction warnings,
and file names—was missing from the RWB Emails
containing PDF copies of the articles, Harris asserts such
omission was purely unintentional and must have been
a result of the electronic processing needed to create an
electronic attachment from an online publication. (Dkt. # 46,
Ex. | at 3-4.) Dow Jones offers no explanation or evidence
to the contrary.

*9 In sum, Dow Jones has not provided evidence that
Harris ever knowingly removed or altered the CMI in any
way and Dow Jones failed to establish a genuine dispute of
material fact on scienter. For these reasons, Dow Jones has
not provided sufficient evidence to support an essential part of
its Section 1202(b) claim. See 17 U.S.C. § 1202(b) (requiring
that the plaintiff prove the infringer knew “that the copyright
management information has been removed or altered.”’).

The Court therefore GRANTS Harris’ Motion for Summary
Judgment on the DMCA claims.

III. Breach of Contract

In Texas, a plaintiff must establish the following essential
elements of a breach of contract claim: “(1) the existence of
a valid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance by
the plaintiff; (3) breach of the contract by defendant; and (4)

WESTLAW

damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the breach.”
Smith Int'l, Inc. v. Egle Grp., LLC, 490 F.3d 380, 387 (Sth Cir.
2007) (quotation omitted).

Dow Jones argues it is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law on its breach of contract claim because there is no
dispute of material fact that Harris agreed to and breached
many provisions of the Dow Jones Subscriber Agreement and
Terms of Use by distributing and providing access to Dow
Jones copyrighted works to thousands of individuals on a
regular basis without Dow Jones's consent. (Dkt. # 45 at 6.)

Harris argues Dow Jones's breach of contract claim fails as a
matter of law because it has no evidence that he assented to
the contract it claims he breached. (Dkt. # 46 at 17.)

A. Existence of Valid Contract
The first issue is whether there is an enforceable agreement.

Dow Jones asserts every subscriber who receives digital
access to WSJ and Barron's must agree to the Dow Jones
Subscriber Agreement and Terms of Use. (Dkt. # 45, Ex. B
at 2.) Specifically, Dow Jones argues that in exchange for
subscriptions to WSJ and Barron's, Harris agreed to pay a
subscription fee and comply with the Terms of Use. (Id. at 21.)
It is undisputed that Harris has subscribed to both WSJ and
Barron's since at least 2010 and renewed his subscriptions to
the digital publications in 2017 and 2018. (Dkt. # 45, Ex. B
at 2.)

In response, Harris claims he did not go online and indicate his
consent to those Terms of Service; that is, he never checked an
“T agree” box or otherwise indicated his consent to the Terms
of Service. (Dkt. # 46, Ex. 1 at 4.) However, the evidence at
least shows that WSJ users were required to “check a box”
to assent in creating their Dow Jones subscriptions. (See Dkt.
# 1, Ex. E at 2.) (“If you agree to be bound by the terms of
this Agreement, you should check the box indicating your
agreement to the terms of this Agreement on the registration
page for the Service.”) Therefore, Harris agreed to the Dow
Jones Subscription Agreement at the time he purchased the
subscription and at the times he renewed those subscriptions.

Nevertheless, the evidence also reflects that the Subscription
Agreement constitutes an enforceable agreement because
Dow Jones provided a sufficient notice to users of its
existence, which demonstrates their implicit assent to the


--- Page 9 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. v. Harris, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

agreement. For example, in a June 29, 2018 RWB Email,
there is a clear notice on the top of a WSJ PDF article
explaining: “This copy is for your personal, non-commercial
use only. Distribution and use of this material are governed
by our Subscriber Agreement and by copyright law. For non-
personal use to order multiple copies, please contact Dow
Jones Reprints ...” (Dkt. # 46 at Ex. 4-3, Ex. 4-4.) This
establishes Dow Jones provided notice to its subscribers of
the Subscription Agreement and that they were bound by its
terms each time an article was printed or downloaded.

*10 Thus, Harris implicitly agreed to the following express
notification at the top of each article printed from WSJ when
he used Dow Jones's services, including the term: “This
copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order
presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues,
clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.” (Dkts.
## 45, Ex. C at 13; 47 at 25.) The Barron's articles similarly
contained notices on its print versions, indicating the same
personal, non-commercial use only notice. (Dkt. # 45, Ex. C
at 15.)

Even if Harris claims he did not affirmatively check and
“T agree” box to Dow Jones's Terms of Use, the notice on
the articles provides sufficient notice that he assented to the
Subscriber Agreement and its limitation on personal use.
Accordingly, the Court finds Harris had actual or constructive
knowledge of the website's Subscriber Agreement and he
assented to be bound by the terms of the agreement each
time he used the websites. See May v. Expedia, Inc., No.
A-16-CV-1211-RP, 2018 WL 4343445, at *3 (W.D. Tex. July
19, 2018), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:16-
CV-1211-RP, 2018 WL 4343427 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 27, 2018)
(finding defendant bound himself to the updated website

terms when he renewed his online subscription). 2
Therefore, there is a valid contract existing between Dow

Jones and Harris by and through his actual and constructive
knowledge of the Dow Jones Subscriber Agreement.

B. Performance and Breach of Terms

The Court agrees that Dow Jones performed its obligations
under the agreement by providing the services outlined in the
Terms of Use to Harris. (Dkt. #23.) That is also evidenced by
Harris’ unrestricted access to the digital publications during
the duration of his subscriptions.

WESTLAW

Therefore, the next issue for consideration is whether Harris
breached the terms of the agreement. Dow Jones alleges that
Harris breached the following terms of the agreement:

(1) By distributing Dow Jones Copyrighted Works to more
than “‘a few individuals” and “on a regular basis” without
paying the licensing fees required by the Dow Jones
Reprints & Licensing Policies. (Dkt. # 1 at 18, Ex. E at
§ 8.2.1.)

(2) By regularly providing others access to Dow Jones
Copyrighted Works. (Id.; Ex. E at § 8.2.2.)

(3) By using, downloading, and storing Dow Jones
Copyright Works for non-personal use. (Id.; Ex. E at §
8.2.3.)

distributed
copyrighted materials to hundreds of his former Titan students
and employees at TRS and UTIMCO over the course of many
years. (Dkt. # 46 at 4.) The evidence is also undisputed that
Harris never paid a licensing fee to include Dow Jones's
materials in his daily RWB Emails. (Dkt. # 45, Ex. A at 18.)
Harris had constructive knowledge that he was to contact
Dow Jones Reprints to pay the appropriate licensing fee for
his non-personal use in distributing the articles and did not
do so.

The evidence is undisputed that Harris

*11 Therefore, the Court finds that Dow Jones is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law on its breach of contract claim
because there is no dispute of material fact that Harris agreed
to and breached the identified provisions of the Dow Jones

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

AUDREY G. FLEISSIG, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE

The matter is before the Court on the motion of Plaintiff Facility Guidelines Institute, Inc. (""FGI"") for a preliminary
injunction against Defendant Upcodes, Inc. (Doc. No. 5). Oral argument on the motion was held on June 6, 2023. Upon
review of the record, including the evidence properly before the Court for purposes of the motion for a preliminary injunction,
and upon consideration of both parties' oral argument, FGI's motion for a preliminary injunction will be denied, as set forth
below.

BACKGROUND

FGI is an independent, non-governmental, not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation. Founded in 1998, FGI is responsible for
reviewing, revising, updating, and publishing three sets of guidelines pertaining to the construction of health care facilities:
(1) Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospitals; (2) Guidelines for Design and Construction of Outpatient Facilities,
and (3) Guidelines for Design and Construction of Residential Health, Care, and Support Facilities (collectively, the ""FGI
Guidelines""). FGI owns copyright registrations for each of the FGI Guidelines published since 2006, including the 2018 and
2022 editions.

FGI reviews and revises the Guidelines on a regular cycle in a consensus process carried out by a multidisciplinary
group of experts. FGI is not a trade group; it does not have members, sponsors, or affiliates who provide funding through
membership fees or dues. FGI intentionally maintains neutrality and independence from outside influence, which allows FGI
to develop and publish standards based on engineering principles and research without influence from paying members or
sponsors. FGI relies on the sales of the FGI Guidelines (primarily the most recent editions) for funding the revision and
publication of the next editions. FGI is a non-profit enterprise and thus charges only as much as necessary to fund its
operations. FGI makes older versions of the FGI Guidelines available for free and provides limited public access to the
current version of the FGI Guidelines. +

[677 F.Supp.3d 962]

UpCodes was founded in 2016 by two brothers, Scott and Garrett Reynolds, with the mission of making it easier for
laypeople and professionals in the architecture, engineering, and construction industries to understand how to comply with
state and local building codes. UpCodes publishes such codes on its website. UpCodes maintains that it does not post
model standards—including FGI's model standards—as model standards, but only as adopted into law by specific
jurisdictions. With respect to this case, UpCodes explains that it only posts the laws that have adopted or incorporated the
FGI guidelines by reference. Any user can view and copy a supported jurisdiction's codes—with that jurisdiction's
amendments integrated into the text—for free and without registering for an account. If a user wants features beyond full
access to the law, such as advanced search and automation tools, UpCodes offers those services for a fee.

Procedural History

On December 6, 2022, FGI filed a complaint in this Court alleging copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. § 501 and
common-law unfair competition under Missouri law. Doc. No. 1. The same day, it filed this instant motion for preliminary
injunction. Doc. No. 5. On January 11, 2023, UpCodes filed its opposition to the preliminary injunction, and shortly thereafter
filed a motion to dismiss on similar grounds. Doc. Nos. 28 and 34. Briefing on the two motions was completed on February
27, 2023. On March 8, 2023, the Court held a video conference with counsel to discuss the pending preliminary injunction
motion and case scheduling. The parties informed the Court that they did not require any discovery or further briefing in
connection with the preliminary injunction motion. The parties agreed that an evidentiary hearing was not required but
requested in-person oral argument on the issue. The parties also agreed to engage in good-faith settlement discussions
related with respect to the 2018 FGI Guidelines and participate in good-faith discussions with respect to whether a
temporary standstill agreement could be reached on the 2022 FGI Guidelines pending a determination by the Court on the


--- Page 2 ---
preliminary injunction motion. Doc. No. 46.

Over the next two months, the parties periodically informed the Court of their ongoing settlement discussions. On May
12, 2023, the parties filed a joint status report and motion for a hearing on the preliminary injunction. Doc. No. 48. The
parties informed the Court that while they had participated in good-faith settlement discussions, they were unable to reach
an amicable resolution. With respect to the 2022 FGI Guidelines, the parties noted that, without waiver of their positions,
including FGI's right to amend its Complaint to further allege facts related to UpCodes' temporary posting and subsequent
removal of the 2022 FGI Guidelines, the parties agreed to a temporary standstill such that UpCodes removed and will not re-
post or post any of the 2022 FGI Guidelines until at least ten business days after the Court's ruling on the preliminary
injunction motion. Upon the parties' request, oral argument for the preliminary injunction motion took place on June 6, 2023.
Doc. No. 50.

ARGUMENT OF THE PARTIES

FGI argues that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction enjoining UpCodes from continuing its copying, publication, and
distribution of the FGI Guidelines on the UpCodes website because FGI has more than a ""fair chance"" of prevailing on its
copyright infringement and unfair competition claims; UpCodes' conduct threatens irreparable harm to FGI in that it will either
force FGI to discontinue operations entirely or will harm FGI's reputation by robbing FGI of its much-valued independence

[677 F.Supp.3d 963]

and objectivity; there is little threat of harm to UpCodes aside from a potential minimal pecuniary loss; and the issuance of
the injunction is in the public's interest.

In response, UpCodes argues that FGI is not likely to succeed on the merits of its copyright claim because UpCodes is
merely publishing the law and ""no one can own the law"" and to the extent any of the materials on UpCodes' website are not
""the law,"" reproducing them in their entirety is permissible under the doctrine of fair use. UpCodes also argues that FGI's
unfair competition claim fails because Upcodes does not make any representations that it is an authorized FGI distributor or
any other representations that are likely to deceive the public. UpCodes further argues that FGI cannot establish a threat of
irreparable harm; the balance of hardships weighs in favor of UpCodes; and an injunction would disserve the public interest
in wide and unfettered access to and knowledge of the law.

In reply, FGI argues that UpCodes' characterization of the guidelines as ""the law"" is incorrect and the FGI Guidelines
are still protected by copyright regardless of whether a state adopts or incorporates the FGI Guidelines by reference. FGI
also argues that UpCodes is only posting the FGI Guidelines and is not posting the actual laws of the various states.

Additional facts and arguments will be discussed in further detail below as relevant to the parties’ specific arguments.
DISCUSSION

""A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, and the burden of establishing the propriety of an injunction is on
the movant."" Sleep No . Corp. v. Young, 33 F.4th 1012 , 1016 (8th Cir. 2022) (quoting Watkins , Inc. v. Lewis, 346 F.3d
841 , 844 (8th Cir. 2003)). Courts consider four factors in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction: (1) the threat
of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the balance between this harm and the injury that granting an injunction will inflict on
other parties; (3) the movant's probability of success on the merits; and (4) the public interest. D.M. by Bao Xiong v. Minn.
State High Sch . League._917 F.3d 994 , 999 (8th Cir. 2019). In the Eighth Circuit, these four factors are known as the ""
Dataphase"" factors, based upon the 1981 en banc case, Dataphase Sys., Inc.v.CL Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109 , 114 (8th
Cir. 1981).

In each case, the factors must be balanced to determine whether they tilt toward or away from granting injunctive relief.
West Pub . Co. v. Mead Data Cent., Inc ., 799 F.2d 1219 , 1222 (8th Cir. 1986). No single factor is dispositive; however,
the movant's probability of success is the most significant factor. Young. 33 F.4th at 1016 . The party requesting injunctive

relief bears the ""complete burden"" of proving that an injunction should be granted. Gelco Corp . v. Coniston Partners__811
F.2d 414 , 418 (8th Cir. 1987).

Likelihood of Success

The Eighth Circuit has expressly rejected the notion that a plaintiff must prove a greater than 50% likelihood that he or
she will prevail on the merits. See Dataphase__ 640 F.2d at 113 . There is no bright-line percentage or ""mathematical
probability"" that FGI must meet at this stage, rather, FGI need only show that it has a ""fair chance"" of prevailing on its claims.
Bao Xiong__917 F.3d at 999 ; Dataphase__640 F.2d at 113.

Copyright Infringement Claim

FGI contends that it is likely to prevail on its claim for copyright infringement because it holds a valid copyright for the
2018 FGI Guidelines and UpCodes has engaged in clear and direct infringement

[677 F.Supp.3d 964]

without any viable defense. To establish a claim of copyright infringement, a plaintiff must prove (1) that they own a valid


--- Page 3 ---
copyright, and (2) that the defendant copied constituent elements of the work that are original. Feist Publ'ns , Inc. v. Rural
Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) . There is no dispute that FGI has copyrights
for the 2018 and 2022 Guidelines, nor is there any dispute that the UpCodes' website contains near or exact duplicates of
the 2018 Guidelines.

The issue in this case is whether model codes, such as the FGI Guidelines, authored by private entities which are then
incorporated by reference or adopted into state law are still protected by copyright. UpCodes contends that the 2018 FGI
Guidelines, as published on its website, have been adopted or incorporated by reference into state law, thus they are part of
the public domain and ""speaking the law"" does not infringe on anyone's copyright. In turn, FGI contends that privately
authored work does not lose its copyright protections when it is adopted or incorporated by reference into state law.

Government Edicts Doctrine

The parties' main dispute is whether the government edicts doctrine applies in this matter. As discussed below, the
government edicts doctrine does not apply in this case, but it provides significant guidance to the remainder of this Court's
analysis while not being dispositive of UpCodes' argument. The government edicts doctrine establishes that ""government
officials empowered to speak with the force of law cannot claim copyright in works created in the course of their official
duties, whether or not the works themselves carry the force of law."" Int'l Code Council , Inc . v. UpCodes , Inc ., No. 17 Civ
6261 (VM), 2020 WL 2750636, at *8 (S.D.NY. May 27, 2020) (""/CC"") (citing Georgia v. Public . Resource . Org . Inc ., 590.
U.S. 255 , 140 S.Ct. 1498 , 206 L.Ed.2d 732 (2020) ("" PRO""). In establishing this rule, the Supreme Court focused on who
authored the works: if it was a judge or legislator, they could not be considered authors entitled to copyright because they
were ""vested with the authority to make and interpret the law,"" but if the author was a private party, the Court found that the
government edicts rule ""does not apply . . . to works created by private parties[ ] who lack the authority to make or interpret
the law."" PRO__140 S.Ct. at 1507 . Because FGI is a private entity that lacks the authority to make or interpret the law, the
government edicts doctrine does not apply.

However, the ""animating principle"" of the doctrine offers important insight into the analysis. ""The animating principle
behind [the government edicts doctrine] is that no one can own the law. Every citizen is presumed to know the law, and it
needs no argument to show . . . that all should have free access to its contents."" /d . (internal quotations marks omitted).
With this principle in mind, the Court must determine whether the FGI Guidelines as adopted or as incorporated by reference
are ""the law"" for the purpose of copyright protection. A number of courts have addressed this issue with respect to model
codes.

Model Code Cases

The majority of courts that have considered this issue have ultimately concluded that model codes that are adopted into
state law, or incorporated by reference, are not subject to copyright infringement. In Building Officials & Code Admn.v.
Code Tech., Inc ., 628 F.2d 730 (1st Cir. 1980) ("" BOCA""), the defendant published and sold the Massachusetts Building
Code, which adopted the plaintiff's model building code with minor amendments. /d. at

[677 F.Supp.3d 965]

732. The First Circuit did not definitely rule on the issue as to whether the model code, as adopted, became part of the
public domain, thus free from copyright infringement, stopping short of this conclusion in order for a hearing on the merits to
be held in the lower court. /d . However, the First Circuit's decision expressly disagreed with the lower court's finding that
plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits, emphasizing ""the very important and practical policy that citizens must have free
access to the laws which govern them . . . based on the concept of due process."" /d. at 734-35.

The First Circuit noted that the building codes at issue ""[had] the effect of law and carr[ied] sanctions of fine and
imprisonment for violations,"" which heightened due process concerns. See id. The BOCA court further noted that it could
not see how the plaintiff's ability to prevent public access to the materials under its copyright could ""be squared with the right
of the public to know the law to which it is subject."" /d. In summation, the Court stated, ""[w]e are, therefore, far from
persuaded that [plaintiff's] virtual authorship of the Massachusetts building code entitles it to enforce a copyright monopoly
over when, where, and how the [code] is to be reproduced and made publicly available. We cannot say with any confidence
that the same policies applicable to statutes and judicial opinions may not apply equally to regulations of this nature."" /d. at
735. 2

The Fifth Circuit also considered this issue in Veeck v . Southern Building Code Congress Int'l , Inc ., 293 F.3d 791 (5th
Cir. 2002) . In Veeck , the plaintiff wanted to post the building codes of two towns in Texas, Anna and Savoy, on his non-
commercial website. The plaintiff was not able to easily locate the codes but knew both of the towns had adopted
defendant's model code in full, so he purchased a copy of the model code and posted it on his website, identifying it as the
building code for the two towns rather than defendant's copyrighted model code. See id. at 793. The Fifth Circuit similarly
emphasized the need for citizens to have free access to the law. See id. at 795-99. The court ultimately concluded that
""when Veeck copies only'the law' of Anna and Savoy, Texas, which he obtained from SBCCI's publication, and when he
reprinted only 'the law' of those municipalities, he did not infringe on SBCCI's copyrights in its model building codes."" /d. at
800. However, the court noted in a footnote that its holding ""might well be the opposite, if [the plaintiff] has copied the model


--- Page 4 ---
codes as model codes, or if he has indiscriminately mingled those portions of 'the law' of Anna and Savoy adopted by their
town councils with other parts of the model code not so adopted."" /d. at 800 n.14.

Here, UpCodes only publishes what has been adopted by the states, and in most cases, states have adopted the FGI
Guidelines in their entirety without amendment. In the instance of Oregon, which adopted the FGI Guidelines with
amendments, UpCodes only published the portions of the FGI Guidelines adopted by the state and integrated the
amendments into the text. FGI argues that ""the law"" is only the text of that statute that adopts the FGI Guidelines, not the
contents of the Guidelines themselves. In other words, in some cases only the language stating the state adopts the FGI
Guidelines. However, this is the same issue that was at issue in Veeck , and compliance with such a statute requires
compliance with all of the various rules set forth in the FGI Guidelines. Therefore, the

[677 F.Supp.3d 966]
public must be on notice of the requirements within the FGI Guidelines.

At oral argument, FGI also argued that the ""shaded"" portions of the FGI Guidelines contained appendices,
commentary, and references and should not be considered as part of the law. However, there is no indication that the states
only adopted the ""unshaded"" portions of the guidelines when they wholly adopted the FGI Guidelines without amendment.
Further, as noted by UpCodes, the ""shaded"" portions are not mere commentary, but are portions of the law that are
necessary for understanding and complying with the law. For example, the shaded portions contain definitions of terms,
explanations of the applicability of the rule, and exceptions to the rules. See Doc. No. 38-6. Given these considerations,
FGI's argument that only the unshaded portion constitutes the law is without merit.

In American Society for Testing and Materials v . Public . Resource . Org . Inc._896 F.3d 437 , 447 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (""
ASTM""), the appellate court declined to rule on the parties' public domain arguments and instead instructed the district court
to conduct a case-by-case analysis under the fair use doctrine, discussed infra . On this point, the court stated,

[a]lthough [defendant] raises a serious constitutional concern with permitting private ownership of standards
essential to understanding legal obligations, we think it best at this juncture to address only that statutory fair use
issue . . . and leave for another day the question of whether the Constitution permits copyright to persist in works
incorporated by reference into law .. . . [I]t is one thing to declare that 'the law’ cannot be copyrighted but wholly
another to determine whether any one of these incorporated standards . . . actually constitutes ""the law.""

Id.

Plaintiff relies heavily on the district court's decision on remand in ASTM. Plaintiff suggests that the district court held
that Plaintiff's copyrights could be enforced even if they were incorporated by reference into state law. See Doc. No. 37 at 7.
This was not the holding. The district court simply noted that the government edicts doctrine did not apply, stating ""[a]
government body that merely incorporates a standard by reference does not independently create any content, and therefore
does not become an ‘author’ of the standard."" See Am. Soc'y for Testing and Materials v . Public . Resource . Org . Inc , 597
F.Supp.3d 213, 231-32 (D.D.C. 2022). Whether the standards otherwise became ""the law"" once incorporated was not
considered. In fact, the district court specifically noted that the appellate court ""did not rule on this issue, and ‘left for another
day’ the 'thorn[y] question of whether standards retain their copyright after they are incorporated by reference into law.'"" Id .
at 232 (citing ASTM._896 F.3d at 441 ). The district court went on to evaluate each standard under the fair use doctrine,
ultimately finding that the defendant could copy, reproduce, or distribute the model standards that were incorporated by
reference into law under the fair use doctrine but could not copy, reproduce, or distribute those standards which differed in
substantial ways from those incorporated by reference into law. 597 F.Supp.3d at 240-41. The district court decision is
currently on appeal.

In ICC , which involves a significantly similar fact pattern and the same defendant, the district court found on summary
judgment that the plaintiffs model codes, as adopted, were part of the public domain because they were in fact ""enacted
state

[677 F.Supp.3d 967]

and local laws binding on the enacting jurisdictions’ constituents,"" thus not subject to copyright protection. 2020 WL
2750636, at *6. The court further held that even if the model codes as adopted were ""not already covered by the law of
public domain, it would be a fair use as a matter of law."" /d. at *24. The /CC court set forth a number of factors to evaluate
whether a privately authored work may ""become the law"" upon substantial government adoption:

(1) whether the private author intended or encouraged the work's adoption; (2) whether the work
comprehensively governs public conduct, such that is resembles a ‘law of general applicability’; (3) whether the
work expressly regulates a broad area of private endeavor; (4) whether the work provides penalties or sanctions
for violation of its contents; and (5) whether the alleged infringer has published and identified the work as part of
the law, rather than the copyrighted material underlying the law.

Id. at *16. Here, FGI actively encourages the codes' adoption into law and even offers an ""adoption toolkit"" to assist
authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs) in adopting the latest edition of the FGI Guidelines. Doc. No. 30-5, at 6. The FGI codes


--- Page 5 ---
are designed to govern the conduct of architects, engineers, facility managers, and other health care stakeholders in the
construction and development of health care facilities and they also regulate a broad area of private endeavor - health care
facility construction. Once the FGI Guidelines are adopted by the states, violations are subject to various penalties and fines.
Lastly, UpCodes has identified the work as part of the law.

Under such a test, the FGI Guidelines could be deemed ""the law"" for purposes of copyright. However, the /CC decision
is not binding precedent on this Court, nor does the Court need to make such an evaluation at this juncture. Ultimately, all
the cases discussed above determined that there was no copyright infringement of model standards that were adopted into
state law, either by finding those model standards were part of the public domain or through the doctrine of fair use.

Incorporation by Reference

Plaintiff relies on a number of cases that have found that when a government incorporates a private work by reference,
it does not lose its copyright. However, as discussed in more detail below, such cases are factually distinct from the issues
before this court. In CCC Information Services Inc . v. Maclean Hunter Market Reports , Inc ., 44 F.3d 61 , 73-74 (2d Cir.
1994), the defendant argued that the ""Red Book,"" a privately authored compilation of used automobile valuations, lost its
copyright protections when it was incorporated by reference in state statutes and regulations. Several state statutes and
regulations required ""that insurance payments for total losses be at least equal to be either the Red Book value or to an
average of Red Book and Bluebook values (unless another approved valuation method is employed)."" /d. at 73. The
Second Circuit noted a lack of authority on this issue and stated that ""it was not prepared to hold that a state's reference to a
copyrighted work as a legal standard for valuation results in the loss of the copyright."" 3 /d. at 74.

[677 F.Supp.3d 968]

Practice Management Information Corp. v . American Medical Ass'n ., involved an extensive coding system developed
by the American Medical Association (""AMA"") ""to enable physicians and others to identify particular medical procedures with
precision"" that the AMA publishes as the Physician's Current Procedural Terminology (""CPT""), which is revised each year to
reflect new developments in medical procedures. 121 F.3d 516 , 517 (9th Cir. 1997). In 1977, Congress instructed the
Health Care Financing Administration (""HCFA"") to establish a uniform code for identifying procedures on Medicare and
Medicaid claim forms. Id. Rather than creating a code system from scratch, the HCFA contracted with the AMA to ""adopt
and use"" the CPT. /d. The plaintiff, Practice Management, a publisher and distributor of medical books that would purchase
copies of the CPT from the AMA for resale, sought a declaratory judgment that the AMA's copyright in the CPT was
invalidated when the HCFA adopted the regulation mandating use of the CPT code numbers in applications for Medicaid

reimbursement. /d. at 518.

The Ninth Circuit relied on Banks v . Manchester__128 U.S. 244 ,9 S.Ct. 36 , 32 L.Ed. 425 (1888) in determining that
AMA's copyright should be enforced. Practice Management._121 F.3d at 518-520 . Crucial to this determination was the
court's finding that the due process concerns of free access to the law was not at stake in this case, explicitly noting that ""
[t]here is no evidence that anyone wishing to use the CPT has any difficulty gaining access to it."" Jd. at 519. Nor did the

plaintiff assert that the AMA had restricted access to users or intended to do so in the future. /d. The court further noted that
in the event the AMA restricted public access to the CPT, other remedies would be available for infringers, including fair use

and due process defenses. /d. The court also suggested that ""mandatory licensing at a reasonable royalty could be
required in light of the great public injury that would result if adequate access to the CPT were denied."" /d.

Here, UpCodes has asserted that FGI has restricted access to the law by failing to provide the state-adopted codes to
the public for free. Unlike the plaintiff in Practice Management, UpCodes is not attempting to resell the FGI Guidelines, but
is providing copies of the law as enacted to the public for free. In other words, Upcodes is not a ""putative copier wishing to
share in [FGI's] statutory monopoly."" See id. at 519. Further the copyrighted work itself is distinguishable. The CPT is an
extrinsic numerical system developed to identify medical procedures; it was not a comprehensive model regulation that was
adopted in whole as state law. See Veeck__293 F.3d at 803-04 (distinguishing CCC and Practice Management , ""[t]his case
does not involve references to extrinsic standards. Instead, it concerns the wholesale adoption of a model code promoted by
its author . . . precisely for use as legislation."").

The Court recognizes the potential risks of adopting a bright line rule that any privately developed model code adopted
into state law automatically becomes part of the public domain for copyright purposes. Such a rule could disincentivize
private organizations from developing, publishing, and updating essential technical regulations and may raise significant
concerns under the Takings Clause. See Practice Management. 121 F.3d at 519-20 . On the other hand, the Court is not
persuaded that the need for economic incentives meaningfully outweighs the due process requirement that everyone have
free access to the law, especially when it comes to the safe construction of health care facilities. Perhaps, as suggested in

Practice Management , the most equitable path forward

[677 F.Supp.3d 969]

involves the payment of a reasonable royalty or licensing fee when the government adopts a privately authored model code
to offset the economic harm that results from free distribution to the public. See id. at 519. The Court need not adopt such a
rule at this juncture, however, as the issue is ultimately resolved under the fair use doctrine.


--- Page 6 ---
Fair Use Doctrine

The Copyright Act provides that ""the fair use of a copyrighted work . . . for purposes such as criticism, comment, news
reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of
copyright."" 17 U.S.C. § 107. In considering whether the use of a copyrighted work is fair use the court should consider the
following factors: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for
non-profit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used
in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work. /d. Such an evaluation requires a case-by-case analysis. Campbell v . Acuff-Rose Music , Inc ., 510 U.S.
569 , 577,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) . The basic purpose of fair use ""is providing a context-based check that
can help keep a copyright monopoly within its lawful bounds."" Google LLC v . Oracle Am ., Inc ., — U.S. —,141 S.Ct. 1183
1198, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021) . The Copyright Act's fair use provisions "" 'set forth general principles, the application of which
requires judicial balancing, depending upon the relevant circumstances.' Because those principles apply across a wide
range of copyrightable material . . . fair use is a flexible’ concept, and ‘its application may well vary depending on context.’ ""

(quoting Google LLC, 141 S.Ct. at 1197).

In National Fire Protection Ass'n v. UpCodes , Inc ., No. CV 21-5262 DSF (E), 2021 WL 4913276 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 9,
2021) ("" NFPA""), which contains a similar fact pattern and the same defendant, the district court denied plaintiff's motion for
a preliminary injunction, finding that plaintiff was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its copyright infringement claim
because of UpCodes ' likelihood of success in its fair use defense. Likewise, the /CC court found that even if UpCodes'
accurate posting of the model codes as adopted was ""not already covered by the law of public domain, it would be fair use
as a matter of law."" ICC , 2020 WL 2750636, at *24.

As discussed above, the ASTM district court also determined on remand that all of the privately authored technical
standards that had been incorporated by reference into federal law in their entirety amounted to fair use because the
apparent purpose was to inform the public of the law and facilitate public debate rather than make a profit; the model
standards were incorporated into law without limitation such that ""the consequence of the incorporation by reference is
virtually indistinguishable from a situation in which the standard had been expressly copied into law""; and the defendant's
reproduction had not had a ""substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original,"" nor did the plaintiffs show
""by a preponderance of the evidence that there [was] a meaningful likelihood of future harm."" 597 F. Supp. 3d 213, 240-450.

(1) Purpose and Character of Use

When evaluating the first factor, purpose and character of the use, courts often discuss whether the use is
""transformative."" See Google LLC__ 141 S.Ct. at 1203 . A use can be transformative when it ""seeks to create new products""

[677 F.Supp.3d 970]

and to ""expand the use and usefulness"" of preexisting materials. /d. ""Posting enacted laws for the purpose of educating
members of the public as to their legal obligations may be transformative, even if the enacted laws are identical to the
copyrighted works."" ICC , 2020 WL 2750636, at *24 (citing ASTM. 896 F.3d at 450 ) (suggesting that ""in certain
circumstances, distributing copies of the law for purposes of facilitating public access could constitute transformative use"");
see alsoA. V.ex rel. Vanderhye v . iParadigms , LLC, 562 F.3d 630 , 639 (4th Cir. 2009) (noting allegedly infringing uses
""can be transformative in function or purpose without altering or actually adding to the original work""). Based on this
reasoning, both [CC and NFPA , determined that UpCodes' publication of the model codes as enacted laws was
transformative because the original works were intended to serve as recommendations on the standards governments
should adopt to improve and safeguard certain industries, whereas UpCodes postings were the model codes as adopted
and at that point constituted actual regulations binding the public and governing its conduct. See Nat'l Fire Prot . Ass'n ,
2021 WL 4913276, at *4-5; ICC , 2020 WL 2750636, at *25.

The ASTM appellate court provided further guidance on this issue, stating that ""[w]here an incorporated standard
provides information essential to comprehending one's legal duties . . . this factor would weigh heavily in favor of permitting a
non-profit seeking to inform the public about the law to reproduce in full the relevant portions of that particular standard."" 896
F.3d at 450 .

In support of its argument that UpCodes' use of the FGI Guidelines constitutes a transformative purpose, UpCodes
asserts that in addition to its use of the model codes as enacted law being transformative, it also provides new and
innovative ways for the public to access and use the law beyond what FGI offers, including integrated amendments for the
jurisdictions that have adopted the FGI Guidelines with amendments; free and unlimited access to the law; the ability for
users to copy and reprint the law; search functionalities; and code comparison technology. Doc. No. 28, 16-17. And
importantly, to the extent the law as enacted differs from the FGI Guidelines, UpCodes' publication reflects the enacted law
— something the FGI Guidelines do not provide.

FGI argues that UpCodes' use is clearly commercial, and it is using the FGI Guidelines ""as bait to find sales leads by
luring potential customers seeking copies of the FGI Guidelines to the UpCodes Website, where UpCodes then bombards
the visitor with promotions for UpCodes' paid 'Premium' platform."" Doc. No. 7 at 17. Whether the use is commercial or non-


--- Page 7 ---
commercial is undoubtedly a significant consideration in evaluating this factor. ""[E]very commercial use of copyrighted
material is presumptively an unfair exploitation of the monopoly privilege that belongs to the owner of the copyright."" Harper
& Row Publishers , Inc. v. Nation Enters .471 U.S. 539 , 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (internal citations
and quotations omitted). ""[A] finding that copying was not commercial in nature tips the scales in favor of fair use. But the
inverse is not necessarily true, as many common fair uses are indisputably commercial."" Google LLC, 141 S.Ct. at 1204 .
Even where a use is to some extent commercial, ""the commercial nature of a use is a matter of degree, not an absolute.""
Sega Enters . Ltd. v. Accolade Inc ., 977 F.2d 1510 , 1522 (9th Cir. 1992), as amended (Jan. 6, 1993) (cleaned up). The
Supreme Court recently summarized how to evaluate this first factor,

[677 F.Supp.3d 971]

In sum, the first fair use factor considers whether the use of a copyrighted work has a further purpose or different
character, which is a matter of degree, and the degree of difference must be balanced against the commercial
nature of the use. If an original work and a secondary use share the same or highly similar purposes, and the
secondary use is of a commercial nature, the first factor is likely to weigh against fair use, absent some other
justification for copying.

Goldsmith._143 S.Ct. at 1277.

The Court disagrees with FGI's contention that UpCodes' use of the FGI Guidelines is purely commercial. No one
contests that UpCodes is a for-profit commercial business, however, it provides the adopted FGI Guidelines entirely for free.
While UpCodes may receive a tangential benefit of drawing users to its website and some of those users may elect to pay
for premium features, it derives no direct monetary benefit from posting the FGI Guidelines as adopted. The benefit to the
public of free access to the law exceeds the monetary benefit UpCodes' may eventually receive. As the other courts that
have evaluated this unique factual scenario determined, the posting of enacted laws for the purpose of educating members
of the public is a transformative use of the copyrighted work. To the extent the purpose of the original work and a secondary
use share a somewhat similar purpose, the secondary use is largely of a non-commercial nature. Further the justification for
copying here is significant; to provide the public with free access to enacted law. As such, the Court finds this factor weighs
in favor of fair use.

(2) Nature of Work

The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, ""calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of
intended copyright protection than others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former
works are copied."" Campbell, 510 U. S. Reports 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164. In evaluating this factor, courts often ask whether
the work is factual or fictional, as ""[t]he law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of
fiction or fantasy."" Harper & Row._471 U. S. Reports 563, 105 S.Ct. 2218 . InASTM, the appellate court found that ""[a]ll of
the works at issue here fall at the factual end of the fact-fiction spectrum, which counsel in favor of finding fair use."" 896
F.3d at 451 . The court further explained that the standards at issue had all ""in some capacity, been incorporated by
reference into law, and . . . the express text of the law falls plainly outside the realm of copyright protection,"" and ""standards

incorporated by reference into law are, at best, at the outer edge of 'copyright's protective purposes.'"" /d. (citation omitted).

FGI argues that the FGI Guidelines ""have been developed as the result of decades of expert interaction and research
through a painstaking multidisciplinary consensus-forming process involving the contribution of many industry leaders. Thus,
the FGI Guidelines are entitled to a high degree of protection."" Doc. No. 7 at 17. FGI also notes that many of the states that
have adopted the 2018 FGI Guidelines have made express reference to the fact that FGI is the creator of and owns valid
copyrights in the FGI Guidelines. 4FGI argues that this indicates that the states

[677 F.Supp.3d 972]

do not intend for the FGI guidelines to fall to the ""outer edge"" of copyright protection by virtue of being incorporated into law
by reference.

The Court recognizes the considerable time, effort, and money that FGI dedicates towards developing the FGI
Guidelines, but the Guidelines are entirely factual and have been adopted into law, thus there is a strong public interest in
the dissemination of these standards so developers, engineers, architects, and the like can comply with the law when
designing and building health care facilities. As such, this factor tips in favor of fair use. See ASTM. 896 F.3d at 451-52 ;
Nat'l Fire Prot . Ass'n , 2021 WL 4913276, at *5-6;/CC , 2020 WL 2750636, at *26.

(3) Amount and Substantiality

The third factor instructs courts to evaluate ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). The Supreme Court has explained that ""the extent of permissible copying
varies with the purpose and character of the use"" and characterized the relevant inquiry as whether ""the amount and
substantiality of the portion used . . . are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" Campbell, 510 U. S. Reports
586 -87 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quotation and citation omitted). In other words, courts should determine ""whether the secondary
use employs more of the copyrighted work than is necessary, and whether the copying was excessive in relation to any
valid purposes asserted under the first factor."" Authors Guild Inc . v. HathiTrust., 755 F.3d 87 , 96 (2d Cir. 2014). ""The



--- Page 8 ---
‘substantiality' factor will generally weigh in favor of fair use where, as here, the amount of copying was tethered to a valid,
and transformative, purpose."" Google LLC, 141 S.Ct. at 1205 .

The copying of entire works ""does not preclude a finding of fair use, [but] it militates against such a finding."" Am.
Geophysical Union v . Texaco Inc ., 60 F.3d 913 , 926 (2d Cir. 1994). ""Complete unchanged copying has repeatedly been
found justified as fair use when the copying was reasonably appropriate to achieve the copier's transformative purpose and
was done in such a manner that it did not offer a competing substitute for the original."" Authors Guild v . Google , Inc ., 804
F.3d 202 , 221 (2d Cir. 2015); see also HathiTrust., 755 F.3d at 98 (explaining that ""for some purposes, it may be necessary
to copy the entire copyrighted work, in which case Factor Three does not weigh against a finding of fair use.""). The ASTM
appellate court applied this rationale, explaining that where a defendant ""limits its copying only to what is required to fairly
describe the standard's legal import, this factor would weigh strongly in favor of finding fair use here, especially given that
precision is ten-tenths of the law."" 896 F.3d at 452 .

UpCodes has copied the majority, if not the entirety, of the FGI Guidelines, but it has done so only to the extent that
governments have enacted such portions of the FGI Guidelines into law. UpCodes' copying is limited to what is contained in
the enacted laws themselves and as such, it is tethered to its transformative purpose. On this basis, the Court finds that this
factor weighs in favor of fair use.

(4) Effect on Market

The fourth fair use factor evaluates ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). This factor ""requires courts to consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the
particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by
the defendant . . . would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for

[677 F.Supp.3d 973]

the original."" Campbell__510 U. S. Reports 590, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotations and citations omitted). There is little
doubt that UpCodes' use of the FGI Guidelines can affect the market for the FGI Guidelines, though to what extent, we can
only speculate. Additionally, FGI noted without citation at oral argument that certain Secretary of State websites provide
access to the FGI Guidelines but seems unconcerned with any market impact their use may have. FGI has not provided any
quantifiable data of harm it has suffered since UpCodes' posting of the FGI Guidelines over a year ago. It is reasonable to
assume that if the FGI Guidelines can be obtained for free from UpCodes or any other website, there is less incentive to
purchase a copy of the codes from FGI. As such, this factor weighs against fair use, but not significantly, as on this record,
FGI has not shown the extent of any market impact.

UpCodes argues that any harm FGI may suffer is not cognizable under the Copyright Act because the dissemination of
the law for free is favorable under the first factor. However, on this record the weight of the other factors, and on balance,
the Court is persuaded that UpCodes' posting of the FGI Guidelines that have been adopted into law likely constitutes fair
use. As such, there is not a fair chance that FGI will succeed on its copyright infringement claim.

Unfair Competition Claim

FGI also asserts a claim for unfair competition under Missouri law. Missouri recognizes a claim for unfair competition
where,

in connection with the marketing of goods or services, the [defendant] makes a representation likely to deceive
or mislead prospective purchasers by causing the mistaken belief that the [defendant's] business is the business
of the [plaintiff], or that the [defendant] is the agent, affiliate, or association of the [plaintiff], or that the goods and
services that the [defendant] markets are produced, sponsored, or approved by the [plaintiff].

Am . Equity Mortg ., Inc. v. Vinson__371 S.W.3d 62 , 64-65 (Mo. Ct. App. 2012) (quotingRestatement (Third) of Unfair
Competition. § 4); see also Nat'l Motor Club of Mo ., Inc. v. Noe. 475 S.W.2d 16 , 19 (Mo. 1972) (""Unfair competition .. .
consists, essentially, in passing off or attempting to pass off, on the public, the goods or business of one person as and for
he goods or business of another, or in the conduct of a trade or business in such a manner that there is either an express or
implied representation to that effect."")

In order to prevail on an unfair competition claim, a plaintiff needs to show ""[e]ither actual or probable deception."" Am .
Ass'n of Orthodontists v . Yellow Book USA, Inc ., 277 S.W.3d 686 , 693 (Mo. Ct. App. 2008) (internal citation omitted). ""
T]he true test of unfair competition [is] whether the defendant's acts . . . are calculated to deceive the ordinary buyer making
his purchases under the ordinary conditions."" Cornucopia , Inc . v. Wagman__710 S.W.2d 882 , 888 (Mo. Ct. App. 1986).

Here, FGI claims that ""UpCodes' decision to publish the FGI Guidelines constitutes conduct likely to deceive or mislead
he public to mistakenly believe that UpCodes owns the FGI Guidelines, is authorized or licensed to provide copies of the
FGI Guidelines, is an agent, affiliate, licensee, or associate of FGI, and/or that UpCodes' services are produced, sponsored,
licensed, or approved by FGI."" Doc. No. 7 at 8.

Preemption by Copyright Act



--- Page 9 ---
UpCodes argues that FGI's unfair competition claims are preempted by the Copyright Act. The Copyright Act
[677 F.Supp.3d 974]

preempts a state law claim if: ""(1) the work at issue is within the subject matter of copyright as defined in § 102 and 103 of
the Copyright Act, and (2) the state law created right is equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of
copyright as specified in [the Copyright Act]."" Ray v. ESPN, Inc.., 783 F.3d 1140 , 1142 (8th Cir. 2015). There is no dispute
that the FGI Guidelines are within the subject matter of copyright as defined in §§ 102 and 103 of the Copyright Act. In
determining whether the state law unfair competition claim lies within the general scope of copyright, courts look at whether
an extra element is required in the state law claim and whether the claim is qualitatively different than the copyright claim.
See Nat'l Car Rental v . Comput . Assocs . Int'l, 991 F.2d 426 , 431 (8th Cir. 1993) (""If an extra element is 'required, instead
of or in addition to the acts of reproduction, performance, distribution or display, in order to constitute a state-created cause
of action, then the right does not lie within the general scope of copyright and there is no preemption.) (citation omitted);
see Huckshold v. HSSL,L.L.C.,344 F. Supp. 2d 1203 , 1206-07 (E.D. Mo. 2004) (explaining that ""[t]he second prong of
the preemption test is satisfied unless there is an 'extra element' that changes the nature of the state law action so that is it '
qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim.'"") (citations omitted) (emphasis original); see also Control Tech .
& Sols ., LLC v. Omni Energy Partners , No. 4:21-cv-686-MTS, 2021 WL 6049812, at *6 (E.D. Mo. Dec. 21, 2021) (finding
that a Missouri unfair competition claim was not preempted by the Copyright Act because the plaintiff's unfair competition
claim was ""qualitatively different than a copyright claim."") (internal quotations omitted).

The Eighth Circuit has not yet considered whether the Copyright Act preempts Missouri or other state-law claims for
unfair competition, however, several other circuits as well as district courts in the Eighth Circuit have considered this issue
and have reached different conclusions. Compare Warner Bros , Inc. v.Am. Broad . Cos.., Inc ., 720 F.2d 231 , 247 (2d
Cir. 1983) (finding the Copyright Act does not preempt a state unfair competition claim based on ""passing off"" because that
right is not equivalent to those protected by copyright); Wolff Shoe Co. v. Mosinger Co ., LLC , No. 4:11-CV-601 TIA, 2012
WL 1033364, at *7 (E.D. Mo. Mar. 27, 2012) (finding that an unfair competition claim and a copyright claim are not
equivalent because ""the common law unfair competition claim requires the additional element of likelihood of confusion."")
with Issaenko v . Univ . of Minn.., 57 F.Supp.3d 985, 1024 (D. Minn. 2014) (""As with other state law claims, claims for unfair
competition are preempted by the Copyright Act to the extent they are 'based upon acts of copyright infringement.’ "")
(citation omitted).

In Control Technology , the court analyzed the principles underlying copyright preemption and unfair competition, noting
that Missouri courts have described the tort of unfair competition as a ""reaffirmation of the rule of fair play"" and ""a protection
against companies deceiving the public."" 2021 WL 6049812, at *5-6 (citing Tension Envelope Corp . v. JBM Envelope Co .,
876 F.3d 1112 , 1121 (8th Cir. 2017)). The court emphasized the element of deception in differentiating unfair competition
from copyright protection. See id. at “6. The court found that the plaintiff's specific allegations that the defendants ""engaged
in several ‘false and misleading’ acts to mislead consumers"" sufficiently differentiated its unfair competition claim from
copyright to avoid preemption. /d.

In response to UpCodes' preemption argument, FGI clarified that ""UpCodes is unfairly competing by referencing FGI's
2018 Guidelines adjacent to and concurrently

[677 F.Supp.3d 975]

with UpCodes' advertising of its fee-based, premium search tool,"" and in doing so, Upcodes deceives or misleads the public
to mistakenly believe that UpCodes owns the FGI Guidelines or is otherwise associated with FGI. But the Court need not
rule on preemption at this juncture, as an unfair competition claim is unlikely to succeed on the merits.

Merits of Unfair Competition Claim

FGI has not explained how the mere proximity of UpCodes' premium content advertisement, which notably does not
have reference to FGI and appears indiscriminately on virtually all of UpCodes' web pages, is likely to deceive or mislead
the public to believe that UpCodes owns the FGI Guidelines or is otherwise affiliated with FGI. The text of the advertisement
states, ""Streamline code research. Elevate code research with automated analysis, shared projects, and interpretive
diagrams. Start 2-Week Free Trial. Contact Sales."" See Compl. § 41. This scenario is a far cry from the type of deception
and misleading behavior exhibited in the cases cited by FGI in support of its claim.

In Control Technology , the defendant stole proprietary materials, trade secrets, and clients and made explicit false
representations about the plaintiff's business in order to poach clients from the plaintiff's business. 2021 WL 6049812, at *5-
6. In Too , Inc. v. Kohl's Dep't Stores , Inc ., the defendant tried to pass off the plaintiffs design as its own by submitting
fraudulent copyright registrations and making false representations to customers that it had created the designs. 210 F.
Supp. 2d 402 , 404 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). In Video Pipeline , Inc. v. Buena Vista Home Ent ., Inc ., the defendant was alleged to
have sold videos under its competitor's trademark. 210 F. Supp. 2d 552 , 565 (D.N.J. 2002). FGI does not allege that
UpCodes made any explicit false misrepresentations, but rather that Upcodes implicitly misled the public regarding its
affiliation with FGI based on the location of its premium content advertisement. The Court is not persuaded on this record
that an advertisement that is devoid of any reference to the plaintiff, the plaintiff's products, or the source of defendant's
products can be ""deceptive"" based on the mere fact that it is located on the same webpage as content in which FGI is


--- Page 10 ---
mentioned. Accordingly, FGI is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its unfair competition claim.

Threat of Irreparable Harm

""Irreparable harm occurs when a party has no adequate remedy at law, typically because its injuries cannot be fully
compensated through an award of damages."" Gen . Motors Corp . v. Harry Brown's , LLC_, 563 F.3d 312 , 319 (8th Cir.
2009). ""[T]he movant is required to show the threat of irreparable harm. Thus, an absence of a finding of irreparable injury
alone is sufficient ground for vacating the preliminary injunction."" Dataphase., 640 F.2d at 114 fn. 9.

FGI argues that there is a threat of irreparable harm because if UpCodes is not enjoined and continues to provide the
FGI Guidelines without charge, it will undermine FGI's only recurring sourcing of funding and threaten to eliminate FGl as a
going concern. FGI contends that if it cannot fund its operations through sales of the FGI Guidelines, it must either
discontinue operations entirely or become dependent on external sources, which would damage FG's strong reputation and
goodwill as a credible, independent standard-setting organization.

In opposition, UpCodes argues that FGI's 11-month delay before filing this suit negates its claims of irreparable harm;
FG's claims that it will need to cease operation entirely are speculative; and FGI's claim that dependence on external
funding would damage its reputation is

[677 F.Supp.3d 976]
undermined by the history of the Guidelines.

""[A] party requesting a preliminary injunction must generally show reasonable diligence."" Benisek v. Lamone_,_585 U.S.
155 , 138 S.Ct. 1942 1944, 201 L.Ed.2d 398 (2018) . Courts have recognized that long delays ""may be taken as an
indication that the harm would not be serious enough to justify a preliminary injunction."" Adventist Health Sys . /SunBelt , Inc
. v. United States Dep't of Health & Human Servs ., 17 F.4th 793 , 805 (8th Cir. 2021) (affirming denial of preliminary
injunction based on a one-year delay). There is no bright line rule with respect to the length of the delay; courts have denied
motions for preliminary injunctions with delays of six months, Grasso Enters ., LLC v . Express Scripts , Inc ., No. 4:14-CV-
1932 HEA, 2015 WL 10781579, at *3-5 (E.D. Mo. Mar. 4, 2015), and courts have granted preliminary injunctions with delays
of seven months. Safety-Kleen Sys ., Inc. v. Hennkens__301 F.3d 931 , 936 (8th Cir. 2002). FGI contends that the length of
time is measured from when the plaintiff first learned of the infringing conduct to when the case was filed, not from when the
infringing conduct began. See Novus Franchising , Inc . v. Dawson__725 F.3d 885 , 894 (8th Cir. 2013); see also 11A
Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1 (3d ed.) (""A long delay by plaintiff after learning of the
threatened harmed also may be taken as an indication that the harm would not be serious enough to justify a preliminary
injunction.""). On this basis, FGI contends that the length of delay is only four and one half months, because FGI only learned
of UpCodes' infringing behavior on July 28, 2022, and filed suit on December 6, 2022. The Court agrees that this is the
proper measurement of delay, and four to five months does not weigh against FGI in this instance. The parties also agreed
that any further delay caused by settlement discussions should not be held against FGI for purposes of the preliminary
injunction motion.

Regardless of any delay, UpCodes argues that FGI cannot demonstrate irreparable harm because its proffered harms
are too speculative. Irreparable harm must be ""certain and great and of such imminence that there is a clear and present
need for equitable relief."" lowa Utils . Bd. v. Fed . Commc'ns Comm'n. 109 F.3d 418 , 425 (8th Cir. 1996). ""Possible or
speculative harm is not sufficient."" Alt. Med . & Pharmacy , Inc. v . Express Scripts , Inc ., No. 4:14-CV-1469 CDP, 2014 WL
4988199, at “6 (E.D. Mo. Oct. 7, 2014) (citing Local Union No . 884 , United Rubber , Cork , Linoleum , & Plastic Workers of
Am.v. Bridgestone/Firestone Inc ., 61 F.3d 1347 , 1355 (8th Cir.1995). In response to this argument, FGI cited a recent
incident where a customer reached out to FGI asking to cancel its order of the 2018 FGI Guidelines because the customer
already had access through UpCodes. The request for a refund for one copy of the 2018 FGI Guidelines is hardly sufficient
to demonstrate irreparable economic harm ""that jeopardizes FGI's very existence."" See Doc. No. 37 at 15-16. FGI has
offered no other support for the economic harm it will imminently suffer.

FGI also asserts that it will suffer irreparable reputational harm if it is forced to accept funding from external sources.
UpCodes argues that this claim is belied by the fact that FGI and the prior entities responsible for publishing the guidelines
have previously relied on outside funding. Specifically, UpCodes asserts that every edition of the Guidelines through at least
2010 was subsidized by external government and external funding. There is no indication that the reputational harm that

[677 F.Supp.3d 977]

FGI fears is imminent or certain. The threat of irreparable harm is too speculative at this juncture to weigh in favor of a
preliminary injunction.

Balance of Harms

""[T]he balance of harms analysis examines the harm of granting or denying the injunction upon both of the parties to
the dispute and upon other interested parties, including the public."" Noodles Dev.,L.P.v. Ninth St. Partners , LLP, 507
F. Supp. 2d 1030 , 1038 (E.D. Mo. 2007). There is undoubtedly a potential harm to FGI in denying this preliminary injunction,
although as discussed, the Court cannot say on this record that the harm is either irreparable or imminent, and there is little


--- Page 11 ---
cognizable harm that UpCodes would suffer given that it provides access to the FGI Guidelines for free, however the harm to
the public weighs against granting a preliminary injunction. As discussed in more detail below, there is a strong public
interest in maintaining free access to the content of the FGI Guidelines as adopted into law.

Public Interest

There is a public interest in protecting copyrights. Taylor Corp . v. Four Seasons Greetings , LLC__315 F.3d 1039 ,
1042 (8th Cir. 2003) (""The public interest is served in protecting the holders of valid copyrights from infringing activities."") But
in this case, there is a competing public interest in unfettered access to the law. PRO__140 S.Ct. at 1507 (""[N]o one can own
the law. Every citizen is presumed to know the law, and it needs no argument to show . . . that all should have free access to
its contents."") Here, the public's interest in unfettered access to the law, specifically access to building codes for health care
facilities outweighs the public's interest in enforcing a copyright. Such a finding is germane to the fair use analysis conducted
above.

Therefore, upon careful consideration of all the Dataphase factors, the Court finds that FGI has failed to meet its burden
to establish it is entitled to injunctive relief, and will deny FGI's motion for a preliminary injunction.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED . Doc. No. 5.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within 14 days of this order the parties shall inform the Court how they wish to
proceed in this matter. Specifically, whether the parties wish to convert the pending motion to dismiss into a motion for
summary judgment in order to expand the current record.

Before: CYNTHIA HOLCOMB HALL, HAWKINS, and SANDRA S. IKUTA, Circuit Judges.
IKUTA, Circuit Judge:

In this appeal, we consider a copyright owner's efforts to stop an Internet search engine from facilitating access to
infringing images. Perfect 10, Inc. sued Google Inc., for infringing Perfect 10's copyrighted photographs of nude models,
among other claims. Perfect 10 brought a similar action against Amazon.com and its subsidiary A9.com (collectively,
""Amazon.com""). The district court preliminarily enjoined Google from creating and publicly displaying thumbnail versions of
Perfect 10's images, Perfect 10 v. Google, Inc.,416 F.Supp.2d 828 (C.D.Cal.2006) , but did not enjoin Google from linking to
third-party websites that display infringing full-size versions of Perfect 10's images. Nor did the district court preliminarily
enjoin Amazon.com from giving users access to information provided by Google. Perfect 10 and Google both appeal the
district court's order. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). '

[508 F.3d 1155]

The district court handled this complex case in a particularly thoughtful and skillful manner. Nonetheless, the district
court erred on certain issues, as we will further explain below. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.

|
Background

Google's computers, along with millions of others, are connected to networks known collectively as the ""Internet."" ""The
Internet is a world-wide network of networks ... all sharing a common communications technology."" Religious Tech. Ctr. v.
Netcom On-Line Commce'n Servs., Inc., 923 F.Supp. 1231 , 1238 n. 1 (N.D.Cal.1995). Computer owners can provide
information stored on their computers to other users connected to the Internet through a medium called a webpage. A
webpage consists of text interspersed with instructions written in Hypertext Markup Language (""HTML"") that is stored ina
computer. No images are stored on a webpage; rather, the HTML instructions on the webpage provide an address for where
the images are stored, whether in the webpage publisher's computer or some other computer. In general, webpages are
publicly available and can be accessed by computers connected to the Internet through the use of a web browser.

Google operates a search engine, a software program that automatically accesses thousands of websites (collections
of webpages) and indexes them within a database stored on Google's computers. When a Google user accesses the
Google website and types in a search query, Google's software searches its database for websites responsive to that search
query. Google then sends relevant information from its index of websites to the user's computer. Google's search engines
can provide results in the form of text, images, or videos.

The Google search engine that provides responses in the form of images is called ""Google Image Search."" In response
to a search query, Google Image Search identifies text in its database responsive to the query and then communicates to
users the images associated with the relevant text. Google's software cannot recognize and index the images themselves.
Google Image Search provides search results as a webpage of small images called ""thumbnails,"" which are stored in
Google's servers. The thumbnail images are reduced, lower-resolution versions of full-sized images stored on third-party
computers.

When a user clicks on a thumbnail image, the user's browser program interprets HTML instructions on Google's
webpage. These HTML instructions direct the user's browser to cause a rectangular area (a ""window"") to appear on the
user's computer screen. The window has two separate areas of information. The browser fills the top section of the screen
with information from the Google webpage, including the thumbnail image and text. The HTML instructions also give the
user's browser the address of the website publisher's computer that stores the full-size version of the thumbnail. ? By
following

[508 F.3d 1156]

the HTML instructions to access the third-party webpage, the user's browser connects to the website publisher's computer,
downloads the full-size image, and makes the image appear at the bottom of the window on the user's screen. Google does
not store the images that fill this lower part of the window and does not communicate the images to the user; Google simply
provides HTML instructions directing a user's browser to access a third-party website. However, the top part of the window
(containing the information from the Google webpage) appears to frame and comment on the bottom part of the window.


--- Page 3 ---
Thus, the user's window appears to be filled with a single integrated presentation of the full-size image, but it is actually an
image from a third-party website framed by information from Google's website. The process by which the webpage directs a

user's browser to incorporate content from different computers into a single window is referred to as ""in-line linking."" Kelly v.
Arriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811 , 816 (9th Cir.2003). The term ""framing"" refers to the process by which information from one

computer appears to frame and annotate the in-line linked content from another computer. Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at
833-34 .

Google also stores webpage content in its cache. ? For each cached webpage, Google's cache contains the text of the
webpage as it appeared at the time Google indexed the page, but does not store images from the webpage. /d. at 833.
Google may provide a link to a cached webpage in response to a user's search query. However, Google's cache version of
the webpage is not automatically updated when the webpage is revised by its owner. So if the webpage owner updates its
webpage to remove the HTML instructions for finding an infringing image, a browser communicating directly with the
webpage would not be able to access that image. However, Google's cache copy of the webpage would still have the old
HTML instructions for the infringing image. Unless the owner of the computer changed the HTML address of the infringing
image, or otherwise rendered the image unavailable, a browser accessing Google's cache copy of the website could still
access the image where it is stored on the website publisher's computer. In other words, Google's cache copy could provide
a user's browser with valid directions to an infringing image even though the updated webpage no longer includes that
infringing image.

In addition to its search engine operations, Google generates revenue through a business program called ""AdSense.""
Under this program, the owner of a website can register with Google to become an AdSense ""partner."" The website owner
then places HTML instructions on its webpages that signal Google's server to place advertising on the webpages that is
relevant to the webpages' content. Google's computer program selects the advertising automatically by means of an
algorithm. AdSense participants agree to share the revenues that flow from such advertising with Google.

[508 F.3d 1157]

Google also generated revenues through an agreement with Amazon.com that allowed Amazon.com to in-line link to
Google's search results. Amazon.com gave its users the impression that Amazon.com was providing search results, but
Google communicated the search results directly to Amazon.com's users. Amazon.com routed users' search queries to
Google and automatically transmitted Google's responses (i.e., HTML instructions for linking to Google's search results)
back to its users.

Perfect 10 markets and sells copyrighted images of nude models. Among other enterprises, it operates a subscription
website on the Internet. Subscribers pay a monthly fee to view Perfect 10 images in a ""members' area"" of the site.
Subscribers must use a password to log into the members' area. Google does not include these password-protected images
from the members' area in Google's index or database. Perfect 10 has also licensed Fonestarz Media Limited to sell and
distribute Perfect 10's reduced-size copyrighted images for download and use on cell phones.

Some website publishers republish Perfect 10's images on the Internet without authorization. Once this occurs,
Google's search engine may automatically index the webpages containing these images and provide thumbnail versions of
images in response to user inquiries. When a user clicks on the thumbnail image returned by Google's search engine, the
user's browser accesses the third-party webpage and in-line links to the full-sized infringing image stored on the website
publisher's computer. This image appears, in its original context, on the lower portion of the window on the user's computer
screen framed by information from Google's webpage.

Procedural History. In May 2001, Perfect 10 began notifying Google that its thumbnail images and in-line linking to the
full-size images infringed Perfect 10's copyright. Perfect 10 continued to send these notices through 2005.

On November 19, 2004, Perfect 10 filed an action against Google that included copyright infringement claims. This was
followed by a similar action against Amazon.com on June 29, 2005. On July 1, 2005 and August 24, 2005, Perfect 10 sought
a preliminary injunction to prevent Amazon.com and Google, respectively, from ""copying, reproducing, distributing, publicly
displaying, adapting or otherwise infringing, or contributing to the infringement"" of Perfect 10's photographs; linking to
websites that provide full-size infringing versions of Perfect 10's photographs; and infringing Perfect 10's
username/password combinations.

The district court consolidated the two actions and heard both preliminary injunction motions on November 7, 2005. The
district court issued orders granting in part and denying in part the preliminary injunction against Google and denying the
preliminary injunction against Amazon.com. Perfect 10 and Google cross-appealed the partial grant and partial denial of the
preliminary injunction motion, and Perfect 10 appealed the denial of the preliminary injunction against Amazon.com. On
June 15, 2006, the district court temporarily stayed the preliminary injunction.

Il
Standard of Review

We review the district court's grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion. A & M Records, Inc.
v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 , 1013 (9th Cir.2001). The district court must support a preliminary injunction with findings of
fact, which we review for clear error.Earth Island Inst. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 442 F.3d 1147 , 1156 (9th Cir.2006). We review



--- Page 4 ---
the district court's conclusions of law de novo. Napster,_239 F.3d at 1013 .
[508 F.3d 1158]

Section 502(a) of the Copyright Act authorizes a court to grant injunctive relief ""on such terms as it may deem
reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright."" 17 U.S.C. § 502(a). ""Preliminary injunctive relief is available to
a party who demonstrates either: (1) a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable
harm; or (2) that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips in its favor. These two formulations
represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of
success decreases."" Napster,239 F.3d at 1013 (internal quotation and citation omitted).

Because Perfect 10 has the burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits, the district court held that Perfect
10 also had the burden of demonstrating a likelihood of overcoming Google's fair use defense under 17 U.S.C. § 107.
Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 836-37 . This ruling was erroneous. At trial, the defendant in an infringement action bears the
burden of proving fair use. See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 590, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994) . Because ""the burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial,"" once the moving party has
carried its burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to show a
likelihood that its affirmative defense will succeed. Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal,_546 U.S.
418 , 429,126 S.Ct. 1211 , 163 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006) ; see also Abbott Labs. v. Andrx Pharms.., Inc., 473 F.3d 1196 , 1201
(Fed. Cir.2007) (to defeat a motion for preliminary injunctive relief in a patent infringement case, the non-moving party must
establish a likelihood of success in proving its defenses of invalidity or unenforceability); PHG Techs., LLC v. St. John Cos.
469 F.3d 1361 , 1365 (Fed.Cir.2006). Accordingly, once Perfect 10 has shown a likelihood of success on the merits, the
burden shifts to Google to show a likelihood that its affirmative defenses will succeed.

In addition to its fair use defense, Google also raises an affirmative defense under title II of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (""DMCA""), 17 U.S.C. § 512. Congress enacted title Il of the DMCA ""to provide greater certainty to service
providers concerning their legal exposure for infringements that may occur in the course of their activities."" Ellison v.
Robertson, 357 F.3d 1072 , 1076 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation omitted). Sections 512(a) through (d) limit liability for
(respectively): ""(1) transitory digital network communications; (2) system caching; (3) information residing on systems or
networks at the direction of users; and (4) information location tools."" /d. at 1077. A service provider that qualifies for such
protection is not liable for monetary relief and may be subject only to the narrow injunctive relief set forth in section 512(j). 17
U.S.C. § 512(a). If Perfect 10 demonstrates a likelihood of success on the merits, Google must show a likelihood of
succeeding in its claim that it qualifies for protection under title II of the DMCA. 4

[508 F.3d 1159]
Ul
Direct Infringement

Perfect 10 claims that Google's search engine program directly infringes two exclusive rights granted to copyright
holders: its display rights and its distribution rights. § ""Plaintiffs must satisfy two requirements to present a prima facie case of
direct infringement: (1) they must show ownership of the allegedly infringed material and (2) they must demonstrate that the
alleged infringers violate at least one exclusive right granted to copyright holders under 17 U.S.C. § 106."" Napster,_239 F.3d
at 1013 ; see 17 U.S.C. § 501(a). Even if a plaintiff satisfies these two requirements and makes a prima facie case of direct
infringement, the defendant may avoid liability if it can establish that its use of the images is a ""fair use"" as set forth in 17
U.S.C. § 107. See Kelly,_336 F.3d at 817 .

Perfect 10's ownership of at least some of the images at issue is not disputed. See Perfect 10, 416 F.Supp.2d at 836 .

The district court held that Perfect 10 was likely to prevail in its claim that Google violated Perfect 10's display right with
respect to the infringing thumbnails. /d. at 844. However, the district court concluded that Perfect 10 was not likely to prevail
on its claim that Google violated either Perfect 10's display or distribution right with respect to its full-size infringing images.
Id. at 844-45. We review these rulings for an abuse of discretion. Napster_239 F.3d at 1013 .

A. Display Right

In considering whether Perfect 10 made a prima facie case of violation of its display right, the district court reasoned
that a computer owner that stores an image as electronic information and serves that electronic information directly to the

user (""i.e., physically sending ones and zeroes over the [I]nternet to the user's browser,"" Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 839 )

is displaying the electronic information in violation of a copyright holder's exclusive display right. /d. at 843-45; see 17 U.S.C.
§ 106(5). Conversely, the owner of a computer that does not store and serve the electronic information to a user is not

displaying that information, even if such owner in-line links to or frames the electronic information. Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d
at 843-45 . The district court referred to this test as the ""server test.""/d. at 838-39.

Applying the server test, the district court concluded that Perfect 10 was likely to succeed in its claim that Google's
thumbnails constituted direct infringement but was unlikely to succeed in its claim that Google's in-line linking to full-size


--- Page 5 ---
infringing images constituted a direct infringement.
[508 F.3d 1160]

Id. at 843-45. As explained below, because this analysis comports with the language of the Copyright Act, we agree with the
district court's resolution of both these issues.

We have not previously addressed the question when a computer displays a copyrighted work for purposes of section
106(5). Section 106(5) states that a copyright owner has the exclusive right ""to display the copyrighted work publicly."" The
Copyright Act explains that ""display"" means ""to show a copy of it, either directly or by means of a film, slide, television image,
or any other device or process...."" 17 U.S.C. § 101. Section 101 defines ""copies"" as ""material objects, other than
phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the work can be
perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device."" /d. Finally, the
Copyright Act provides that ""[a] work is “fixed' in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy or
phonorecord, by or under the authority of the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived,
reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration."" /d.

We must now apply these definitions to the facts of this case. A photographic image is a work that is ""fixed' ina
tangible medium of expression,"" for purposes of the Copyright Act, when embodied (i.e., stored) in a computer's server (or
hard disk, or other storage device). The image stored in the computer is the ""copy"" of the work for purposes of copyright law.
See MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511 , 517-18 (9th Cir.1993) (a computer makes a ""copy"" of a software
program when it transfers the program from a third party's computer (or other storage device) into its own memory, because
the copy of the program recorded in the computer is ""fixed"" in a manner that is ""sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it
to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration"" (quoting 17 U.S.C. §
101)). The computer owner shows a copy ""by means of a ... device or process"" when the owner uses the computer to fill the
computer screen with the photographic image stored on that computer, or by communicating the stored image electronically
to another person's computer. 17 U.S.C. § 101. In sum, based on the plain language of the statute, a person displays a
photographic image by using a computer to fill a computer screen with a copy of the photographic image fixed in the
computer's memory. There is no dispute that Google's computers store thumbnail versions of Perfect 10's copyrighted
images and communicate copies of those thumbnails to Google's users. © Therefore, Perfect 10 has made a prima facie
case that Google's communication of its stored thumbnail images directly infringes Perfect 10's display right.

Google does not, however, display a copy of full-size infringing photographic images for purposes of the Copyright Act
when Google frames in-line linked images that appear on a user's computer screen. Because Google's computers do not
store the photographic images, Google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act. In other
words, Google does not have any ""material objects ... in

[508 F.3d 1161]

which a work is fixed ... and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated"" and thus
cannot communicate a copy. 17 U.S.C. § 101.

Instead of communicating a copy of the image, Google provides HTML instructions that direct a user's browser to a
website publisher's computer that stores the full-size photographic image. Providing these HTML instructions is not
equivalent to showing a copy. First, the HTML instructions are lines of text, not a photographic image. Second, HTML
instructions do not themselves cause infringing images to appear on the user's computer screen. The HTML merely gives
the address of the image to the user's browser. The browser then interacts with the computer that stores the infringing
image. It is this interaction that causes an infringing image to appear on the user's computer screen. Google may facilitate
the user's access to infringing images. However, such assistance raises only contributory liability issues, see Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913 , 929-30, 125 S.Ct. 2764 , 162 L.Ed.2d 781 (2005) , Napster,
239 F.3d at 1019 , and does not constitute direct infringement of the copyright owner's display rights.

Perfect 10 argues that Google displays a copy of the full-size images by framing the full-size images, which gives the
impression that Google is showing the image within a single Google webpage. While in-line linking and framing may cause
some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google webpage, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act,
does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion. Cf. 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1) (providing that a
person who uses a trademark in a manner likely to cause confusion shall be liable in a civil action to the trademark
registrant). ”

Nor does our ruling that a computer owner does not display a copy of an image when it communicates only the HTML
address of the copy erroneously collapse the display right in section 106(5) into the reproduction right set forth in section
106(1). Nothing in the Copyright Act prevents the various rights protected in section 106 from overlapping. Indeed, under
some circumstances, more than one right must be infringed in order for an infringement claim to arise. For example, a
""Game Genie"" device that allowed a player to alter features of a Nintendo computer game did not infringe Nintendo's right to
prepare derivative works because the Game Genie did not incorporate any portion of the game itself._See Lewis Galoob
Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of Am., Inc., 964 F.2d 965 , 967 (9th Cir.1992). We held that a copyright holder's right to create
derivative works is not infringed unless the alleged derivative work ""incorporate[s] a protected work in some concrete or
permanent “form.” /d. In other words, in some contexts, the claimant must be able to claim infringement of its reproduction



--- Page 6 ---
right in order to claim infringement of its right to prepare derivative works.
[508 F.3d 1162]

Because Google's cache merely stores the text of webpages, our analysis of whether Google's search engine program
potentially infringes Perfect 10's display and distribution rights is equally applicable to Google's cache. Perfect 10 is not likely
to succeed in showing that a cached webpage that in-line links to full-size infringing images violates such rights. For
purposes of this analysis, it is irrelevant whether cache copies direct a user's browser to third-party images that are no
longer available on the third party's website, because it is the website publisher's computer, rather than Google's computer,
that stores and displays the infringing image.

B. Distribution Right

The district court also concluded that Perfect 10 would not likely prevail on its claim that Google directly infringed
Perfect 10's right to distribute its full-size images. Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 844-45 . The district court reasoned that
distribution requires an ""actual dissemination"" of a copy. /d. at 844. Because Google did not communicate the full-size
images to the user's computer, Google did not distribute these images. /d.

Again, the district court's conclusion on this point is consistent with the language of the Copyright Act. Section 106(3)
provides that the copyright owner has the exclusive right ""to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending."" 17 U.S.C. § 106(3). As noted, ""copies"" means
""material objects ... in which a work is fixed."" 17 U.S.C. § 101. The Supreme Court has indicated that in the electronic
context, copies may be distributed electronically. See N.Y. Times Co. v. Tasini, 533 U.S. 483 , 498, 121 S.Ct. 2381 , 150
L.Ed.2d 500 (2001) (a computer database program distributed copies of newspaper articles stored in its computerized
database by selling copies of those articles through its database service). Google's search engine communicates HTML
instructions that tell a user's browser where to find full-size images on a website publisher's computer, but Google does not
itself distribute copies of the infringing photographs. It is the website publisher's computer that distributes copies of the
images by transmitting the photographic image electronically to the user's computer. As in Tasini, the user can then obtain
copies by downloading the photo or printing it.

Perfect 10 incorrectly relies on Hotaling v. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and Napster for the proposition
that merely making images ""available"" violates the copyright owner's distribution right. Hotaling v. Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints, 118 F.3d 199 (4th Cir.1997) ; Napster,_239 F.3d 1004 . Hotaling held that the owner of a collection of
works who makes them available to the public may be deemed to have distributed copies of the works. Hotaling, 118 F.3d at

203 . Similarly, the distribution rights of the plaintiff copyright owners were infringed by Napsterusers (private individuals
with collections of music files stored on their home computers) when they used the Napster software to make their

collections available to all other Napster users. Napster,_239 F.3d at 1011-14.

This ""deemed distribution"" rule does not apply to Google. Unlike the participants in the Napster system or the library in
Hotaling, Google does not own a collection of Perfect 10's full-size images and does not communicate these images to the
computers of people using Google's search engine. Though Google indexes these images, it does not have a collection of
stored full-size images it makes available to the public. Google therefore cannot be deemed to distribute copies of these
images under the reasoning of Napster or

[508 F.3d 1163]

Hotaling. Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that Perfect 10 does not have a likelihood of success in proving
that Google violates Perfect 10's distribution rights with respect to full-size images.

C. Fair Use Defense

Because Perfect 10 has succeeded in showing it would prevail in its prima facie case that Google's thumbnail images
infringe Perfect 10's display rights, the burden shifts to Google to show that it will likely succeed in establishing an affirmative
defense. Google contends that its use of thumbnails is a fair use of the images and therefore does not constitute an
infringement of Perfect 10's copyright. See 17 U.S.C. § 107.

The fair use defense permits the use of copyrighted works without the copyright owner's consent under certain
situations. The defense encourages and allows the development of new ideas that build on earlier ones, thus providing a
necessary counterbalance to the copyright law's goal of protecting creators’ work product. ""From the infancy of copyright
protection, some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials has been thought necessary to fulfill copyright's very
purpose..."" Campbell,510 U.S. at 575 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . ""The fair use doctrine thus ‘permits [and requires] courts to avoid
rigid application of the copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to
foster."" Id. at 577, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting_Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207 , 236, 110 S.Ct. 1750 , 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) )
(alteration in original).

Congress codified the common law of fair use in 17 U.S.C. § 107, which provides:

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by


--- Page 7 ---
reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an
infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be
considered shall include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of
all the above factors.

17 U.S.C. § 107.

We must be flexible in applying a fair use analysis; it ""is not to be simplified with bright-line rules, for the statute, like the
doctrine it recognizes, calls for case-by-case analysis.... Nor may the four statutory factors be treated in isolation, one from
another. All are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."" Campbell, 510 U.S.
at 577-78 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; see also Kelly, 336 F.3d at 817-18 . The purpose of copyright law is ""[t]lo promote the Progress
of Science and useful Arts,"" U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 8, and to serve ""the welfare of the public."""" Sony Corp. of Am. v.
Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 429 n. 10,104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 2222, 60th
Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1909)).

[508 F.3d 1164]

In applying the fair use analysis in this case, we are guided by Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., which considered substantially
the same use of copyrighted photographic images as is at issue here. See 336 F.3d 811 . In Kelly, a photographer brought a
direct infringement claim against Arriba, the operator of an Internet search engine. The search engine provided thumbnail
versions of the photographer's images in response to search queries. /d. at 815-16. We held that Arriba's use of thumbnail
images was a fair use primarily based on the transformative nature of a search engine and its benefit to the public. /d. at
818-22. We also concluded that Arriba's use of the thumbnail images did not harm the photographer's market for his image.
Id. at 821-22.

In this case, the district court determined that Google's use of thumbnails was not a fair use and distinguished Kelly.
Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 845-51 . We consider these distinctions in the context of the four-factor fair use analysis.

Purpose and character of the use. The first factor, 17 U.S.C. § 107(1), requires a court to consider ""the purpose and
character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes."" The

central purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether and to what extent the new work is ""transformative."" Campbell, 510
U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . A work is ""transformative"" when the new work does not ""merely supersede the objects of the
original creation"" but rather ""adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new

expression, meaning, or message."" /d. (internal quotation and alteration omitted). Conversely, if the new work ""supersede[s]

the use of the original,"" the use is likely not a fair use. Harper & Row Publishers. Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539 , 550-
51, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (internal quotation omitted) (publishing the ""heart"" of an unpublished work and

thus supplanting the copyright holder's first publication right was not a fair use); see also Wall Data Inc. v. L.A. County
Sheriff's Dep't, 447 F.3d 769 , 778-82 (9th Cir.2006) (using a copy to save the cost of buying additional copies of a computer
program was not a fair use). ®

As noted in Campbell, a ""transformative work"" is one that alters the original work
[508 F.3d 1165]

""with new expression, meaning, or message."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . ""A use is considered
transformative only where a defendant changes a plaintiff's copyrighted work or uses the plaintiff's copyrighted work ina
different context such that the plaintiff's work is transformed into a new creation."" Wall Data, 447 F.3d at 778 .

Google's use of thumbnails is highly transformative. In Kelly, we concluded that Arriba's use of thumbnails was
transformative because ""Arriba's use of the images serve[d] a different function than Kelly's use—improving access to
information on the [l]nternet versus artistic expression."" Kelly, 336 F.3d at 819 . Although an image may have been created
originally to serve an entertainment, aesthetic, or informative function, a search engine transforms the image into a pointer
directing a user to a source of information. Just as a ""parody has an obvious claim to transformative value"" because ""it can
provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a new one,"" Campbell,_510 U.S. at
579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 , a search engine provides social benefit by incorporating an original work into a new work, namely, an



--- Page 8 ---
electronic reference tool. Indeed, a search engine may be more transformative than a parody because a search engine
provides an entirely new use for the original work, while a parody typically has the same entertainment purpose as the
original work. See, e.g., id. at 594-96, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (holding that 2 Live Crew's parody of ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" using the
words ""hairy woman"" or ""bald headed woman"" was a transformative work, and thus constituted a fair use); Mattel, Inc. v.
Walking Mountain Prods., 353 F.3d 792 , 796-98, 800-06 (9th Cir.2003) (concluding that photos parodying Barbie by
depicting ""nude Barbie dolls juxtaposed with vintage kitchen appliances"" was a fair use). In other words, a search engine
puts images ""in a different context"" so that they are ""transformed into a new creation."" Wall Data, 447 F.3d at 778 .

The fact that Google incorporates the entire Perfect 10 image into the search engine results does not diminish the
transformative nature of Google's use. As the district court correctly noted, Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 848-49 , we
determined in Kelly that even making an exact copy of a work may be transformative so long as the copy serves a different
function than the original work, Kelly, 336 F.3d at 818-19 . For example, the First Circuit has held that the republication of
photos taken for a modeling portfolio in a newspaper was transformative because the photos served to inform, as well as
entertain. See Nunez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp., 235 F.3d 18 , 22-23 (1st Cir.2000). In contrast, duplicating a church's
religious book for use by a different church was not transformative. See Worldwide Church of God v. Phila. Church of God.
Inc., 227 F.3d 1110 , 1117 (9th Cir.2000). Nor was a broadcaster's simple retransmission of a radio broadcast over
elephone lines transformative, where the original radio shows were given no ""new expression, meaning, or message.""
Infinity Broad. Corp. v. Kirkwood, 150 F.3d 104 , 108 (2d Cir.1998). Here, Google uses Perfect 10's images in a new context
0 serve a different purpose.

The district court nevertheless determined that Google's use of thumbnail images was less transformative than Arriba's
use of thumbnails in Kelly because Google's use of thumbnails superseded Perfect 10's right to sell its reduced-size images

or use on cell phones. See Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 849 . The district court stated that ""mobile users can download and
save the thumbnails displayed by Google Image Search onto their phones,"" and concluded ""to the extent that users may
choose to download free images to their

508 F.3d 1166]

phone rather than purchase [Perfect 10's] reduced-size images, Google's use supersedes [Perfect 10's]."" /d.

Additionally, the district court determined that the commercial nature of Google's use weighed against its transformative
nature. /d. Although Kelly held that the commercial use of the photographer's images by Arriba's search engine was less
exploitative than typical commercial use, and thus weighed only slightly against a finding of fair use, Kelly, 336 F.3d at 818-
20 , the district court here distinguished Kelly on the ground that some website owners in the AdSense program had

infringing Perfect 10 images on their websites, Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 846-47 . The district court held that because
Google's thumbnails ""lead users to sites that directly benefit Google's bottom line,"" the AdSense program increased the

commercial nature of Google's use of Perfect 10's images. /d. at 847.

In conducting our case-specific analysis of fair use in light of the purposes of copyright, Campbell,_510 U.S. at 581 ,
114 S.Ct. 1164 , we must weigh Google's superseding and commercial uses of thumbnail images against Google's
significant transformative use, as well as the extent to which Google's search engine promotes the purposes of copyright
and serves the interests of the public. Although the district court acknowledged the ""truism that search engines such as
Google Image Search provide great value to the public,"" Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 848-49 , the district court did not
expressly consider whether this value outweighed the significance of Google's superseding use or the commercial nature of
Google's use. /d. at 849. The Supreme Court, however, has directed us to be mindful of the extent to which a use promotes
the purposes of copyright and serves the interests of the public. See Campbell,_510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; Harper &
Row, 471 U.S. at 556-57 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; Sony, 464 U.S. at 431-32 , 104 S.Ct. 774 .

We note that the superseding use in this case is not significant at present: the district court did not find that any
downloads for mobile phone use had taken place. See Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 849 . Moreover, while Google's use of
thumbnails to direct users to AdSense partners containing infringing content adds a commercial dimension that did not exist
in Kelly, the district court did not determine that this commercial element was significant. See id. at 848-49. The district court
stated that Google's AdSense programs as a whole contributed ""$630 million, or 46% of total revenues"" to Google's bottom
line, but noted that this figure did not ""break down the much smaller amount attributable to websites that contain infringing
content."" /d. at 847 & n. 12 (internal quotation omitted).

We conclude that the significantly transformative nature of Google's search engine, particularly in light of its public
benefit, outweighs Google's superseding and commercial uses of the thumbnails in this case. In reaching this conclusion, we
note the importance of analyzing fair use flexibly in light of new circumstances. Sony, 464 U.S. at 431-32 , 104 S.Ct. 774 ;

id. at 448 n. 31, 104 S.Ct. 774 (""[Section 107] endorses the purpose and general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use,
but there is no disposition to freeze the doctrine in the statute, especially during a period of rapid technological change.""
(quoting H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 65-66 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin. News 1976, p. 5680)). We are also mindful of
the Supreme Court's direction that ""the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors,
like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 .



--- Page 9 ---
[508 F.3d 1167]

Accordingly, we disagree with the district court's conclusion that because Google's use of the thumbnails could
supersede Perfect 10's cell phone download use and because the use was more commercial than Arriba's, this fair use
factor weighed ""slightly"" in favor of Perfect 10. Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 849 . Instead, we conclude that the
transformative nature of Google's use is more significant than any incidental superseding use or the minor commercial
aspects of Google's search engine and website. Therefore, this factor weighs heavily in favor of Google.

The nature of the copyrighted work.With respect to the second factor, ""the nature of the copyrighted work,"" 17 U.S.C.
§ 107(2), our decision in Kelly is directly on point. There we held that the photographer's images were ""creative in nature""
and thus ""closer to the core of intended copyright protection than are more fact-based works."" Kelly, 336 F.3d at 820
(internal quotation omitted). However, because the photos appeared on the Internet before Arriba used thumbnail versions
in its search engine results, this factor weighed only slightly in favor of the photographer. /d.

Here, the district court found that Perfect 10's images were creative but also previously published. Perfect 10,416
F.Supp.2d at 850 . The right of first publication is ""the author's right to control the first public appearance of his expression.""
Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . Because this right encompasses ""the choices of when, where, and in what
form first to publish a work,"" id., an author exercises and exhausts this one-time right by publishing the work in any medium.
See, e.g., Batiac Prods. Inc. v. Good-Times Home Video Corp., 160 F.3d 1223 , 1235 (9th Cir.1998) (noting, in the context
of the common law right of first publication, that such a right ""does not entail multiple first publication rights in every available
medium""). Once Perfect 10 has exploited this commercially valuable right of first publication by putting its images on the
Internet for paid subscribers, Perfect 10 is no longer entitled to the enhanced protection available for an unpublished work.
Accordingly the district court did not err in holding that this factor weighed only slightly in favor of Perfect 10. 9 See Perfect
10,416 F.Supp.2d at 849-50 .

The amount and substantiality of the portion used.""The third factor asks whether the amount and substantiality of the
portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole ... are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.""
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotation omitted); see also 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). In Kelly, we held
Arriba's use of the entire photographic image was reasonable in light of the purpose of a search engine. Kelly, 336 F.3d at
821 . Specifically, we noted, ""[iJt was necessary for Arriba to copy the entire image to allow users to recognize the image
and decide whether to pursue more information about the image or the originating [website]. If Arriba only copied part of the
image, it would be more difficult to identify it, thereby reducing the usefulness of the visual search engine."" /d. Accordingly,
we concluded that this factor did not weigh in favor of either

[508 F.3d 1168]

party. /d. Because the same analysis applies to Google's use of Perfect 10's image, the district court did not err in finding
that this factor favored neither party.

Effect of use on the market.The fourth factor is ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). In Kelly, we concluded that Arriba's use of the thumbnail images did not harm the
market for the photographer's full-size images. See Kelly, 336 F.3d at 821-22 . We reasoned that because thumbnails were
not a substitute for the full-sized images, they did not harm the photographer's ability to sell or license his full-sized images.
Id. The district court here followed Kelly's reasoning, holding that Google's use of thumbnails did not hurt Perfect 10's
market for full-size images. See Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 850-51 . We agree.

Perfect 10 argues that the district court erred because the likelihood of market harm may be presumed if the intended
use of an image is for commercial gain. However, this presumption does not arise when a work is transformative because
""market substitution is at least less certain, and market harm may not be so readily inferred."" Campbell,_510 U.S. at 591 ,
114 S.Ct. 1164 . As previously discussed, Google's use of thumbnails for search engine purposes is highly transformative,
and so market harm cannot be presumed.

Perfect 10 also has a market for reduced-size images, an issue not considered in Kelly. The district court held that
""Google's use of thumbnails likely does harm the potential market for the downloading of [Perfect 10's] reduced-size images
onto cell phones."" Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 851 (emphasis omitted). The district court reasoned that persons who can
obtain Perfect 10 images free of charge from Google are less likely to pay for a download, and the availability of Google's
thumbnail images would harm Perfect 10's market for cell phone downloads. /d. As we discussed above, the district court did
not make a finding that Google users have downloaded thumbnail images for cell phone use. This potential harm to Perfect
10's market remains hypothetical. We conclude that this factor favors neither party.

Having undertaken a case-specific analysis of all four factors, we now weigh these factors together ""in light of the
purposes of copyright."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; see also Kelly, 336 F.3d at 818 (""We must balance[the
section 107] factors in light of the objectives of copyright law, rather than view them as definitive or determinative tests.""). In
this case, Google has put Perfect 10's thumbnail images (along with millions of other thumbnail images) to a use
fundamentally different than the use intended by Perfect 10. In doing so, Google has provided a significant benefit to the
public. Weighing this significant transformative use against the unproven use of Google's thumbnails for cell phone



--- Page 10 ---
downloads, and considering the other fair use factors, all in light of the purpose of copyright, we conclude that Google's use
of Perfect 10's thumbnails is a fair use. Because the district court here ""found facts sufficient to evaluate each of the
statutory factors ... [we] need not remand for further factfinding."" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 560 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (internal
quotation omitted). We conclude that Google is likely to succeed in proving its fair use defense and, accordingly, we vacate
the preliminary injunction regarding Google's use of thumbnail images.

IV
Secondary Liability for Copyright Infringement
We now turn to the district court's ruling that Google is unlikely to be secondarily
[508 F.3d 1169]

liable for its in-line linking to infringing full-size images under the doctrines of contributory and vicarious infringement. '° The
district court ruled that Perfect 10 did not have a likelihood of proving success on the merits of either its contributory
infringement or vicarious infringement claims with respect to the full-size images. See Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 856 ,
858. In reviewing the district court's conclusions, we are guided by the Supreme Court's recent interpretation of secondary
liability, namely: ""[o]ne infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement, and infringes
vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it."" Grokster, 545 U.S. at
930 , 125 S.Ct. 2764 (internal citations omitted).

Direct Infringement by Third Parties. As a threshold matter, before we examine Perfect 10's claims that Google is
secondarily liable, Perfect 10 must establish that there has been direct infringement by third parties. See Napster,_239 F.3d
at 1013 n. 2 (""Secondary liability for copyright infringement does not exist in the absence of direct infringement by a third
party."").

Perfect 10 alleges that third parties directly infringed its images in three ways. First, Perfect 10 claims that third-party
websites directly infringed its copyright by reproducing, displaying, and distributing unauthorized copies of Perfect 10's
images. Google does not dispute this claim on appeal.

Second, Perfect 10 claims that individual users of Google's search engine directly infringed Perfect 10's copyrights by
storing full-size infringing images on their computers. We agree with the district court's conclusion that Perfect 10 failed to
provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. See Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 852 . There is no evidence in the record
directly establishing that users of Google's search engine have stored infringing images on their computers, and the district
court did not err in declining to infer the existence of such evidence.

Finally, Perfect 10 contends that users who link to infringing websites automatically make ""cache"" copies of full-size
images and thereby directly infringe Perfect 10's reproduction right. The district court rejected this argument, holding that any
such reproduction was likely a ""fair use."" /d. at 852 n. 17. The district court reasoned that ""[]ocal caching by the browsers of
individual users is noncommercial, transformative, and no more than necessary to achieve the objectives of decreasing
network latency and minimizing unnecessary bandwidth usage (essential to the [I]nternet). It has a minimal impact on the
potential market for the original work...."" /d. We agree; even assuming such automatic copying could constitute direct
infringement, it is a fair use in this context. The copying function performed automatically by a user's computer to assist in
accessing the Internet is a transformative use. Moreover, as noted by the district court, a cache copies no more than is
necessary to assist the user in Internet use. It is designed to enhance an individual's computer use, not to supersede the
copyright holders' exploitation of their works. Such automatic background copying has no more than a minimal effect on
Perfect 10's rights, but a considerable public benefit. Because the four fair use factors weigh in favor of concluding that

[508 F.3d 1170]

cache copying constitutes a fair use, Google has established a likelihood of success on this issue. Accordingly, Perfect 10
has not carried its burden of showing that users' cache copies of Perfect 10's full-size images constitute direct infringement.

Therefore, we must assess Perfect 10's arguments that Google is secondarily liable in light of the direct infringement
that is undisputed by the parties: third-party websites' reproducing, displaying, and distributing unauthorized copies of

Perfect 10's images on the Internet. /d. at 852.

A. Contributory Infringement

In order for Perfect 10 to show it will likely succeed in its contributory liability claim against Google, it must establish that
Google's activities meet the definition of contributory liability recently enunciated in Grokster. Within the general rule that ""
[o]ne infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement,"" Grokster, 545 U.S. at 930 , 125
S.Ct. 2764 , the Court has defined two categories of contributory liability: ""Liability under our jurisprudence may be
predicated on actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Court's opinion develops) or on
distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of ‘substantial’ or ‘commercially
significant’ noninfringing uses."" /d. at 942, 125 S.Ct. 2764 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (quoting Sony, 464 U.S. at 442 , 104
S.Ct. 774 ); see also id. at 936-37, 125 S.Ct. 2764 .


--- Page 11 ---
Looking at the second category of liability identified by the Supreme Court (distributing products), Google relies on
Sony, 464 U.S. at 442 , 104 S.Ct. 774 , to argue that it cannot be held liable for contributory infringement because liability
does not arise from the mere sale of a product (even with knowledge that consumers would use the product to infringe) if the
product is capable of substantial non-infringing use. Google argues that its search engine service is such a product.

Assuming the principle enunciated in Sonyis applicable to the operation of Google's search engine, then Google cannot be
held liable for contributory infringement solely because the design of its search engine facilitates such infringement.
Grokster, 545 U.S. at 931-32 , 125 S.Ct. 2764 (discussing Sony, 464 U.S. 417 , 104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d 574 ). Nor can
Google be held liable solely because it did not develop technology that would enable its search engine to automatically avoid
infringing images. See id. at 939 n. 12, 125 S.Ct. 2764 . However, Perfect 10 has not based its claim of infringement on the
design of Google's search engine and the Sony rule does not immunize Google from other sources of contributory liability.
See id. at 933-34, 125 S.Ct. 2764 .

We must next consider whether Google could be held liable under the first category of contributory liability identified by
the Supreme Court, that is, the liability that may be imposed for intentionally encouraging infringement through specific acts.
""| Grokster tells us that contribution to infringement must be intentional for liability to arise. Grokster, 545 U.S. at 930 , 125
S.Ct. 2764 . However, Grokster also directs us to analyze contributory liability in light of ""rules of fault-based liability derived
from the common law,"" id. at 934-35, 125 S.Ct. 2764 , and

[508 F.3d 1171]

common law principles establish that intent may be imputed. ""Tort law ordinarily imputes to an actor the intention to cause
the natural and probable consequences of his conduct."" DeVoto v. Pac. Fid. Life Ins. Co., 618 F.2d 1340 , 1347 (9th Cir.
1980); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 8A cmt. b (1965) (""If the actor knows that the consequences are certain,
or substantially certain, to result from his act, and still goes ahead, he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to
produce the result.""). When the Supreme Court imported patent law's ""staple article of commerce doctrine"" into the copyright
context, it also adopted these principles of imputed intent. Grokster,_545 U.S. at 932 , 125 S.Ct. 2764 (""The [staple article of
commerce] doctrine was devised to identify instances in which it may be presumed from distribution of an article in
commerce that the distributor intended the article to be used to infringe another's patent, and so may justly be held liable for
that infringement.""). Therefore, under Grokster, an actor may be contributorily liable for intentionally encouraging direct
infringement if the actor knowingly takes steps that are substantially certain to result in such direct infringement.

Our tests for contributory liability are consistent with the rule set forth in Grokster. We have adopted the general rule set
forth in Gershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management, Inc., namely: ""one who, with knowledge of the
infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another, may be held liable as a
‘contributory’ infringer,"" 443 F.2d 1159 , 1162 (2d Cir.1971). See Ellison, 357 F.3d at 1076 ; Napster, 239 F.3d at 1019 ;
Fonovisa, Inc. v. Cherry Auction, Inc.. 76 F.3d 259 , 264 (9th Cir.1996).

We have further refined this test in the context of cyberspace '@ to determine when contributory liability can be imposed

on a provider of Internet access or services. See Napster,_239 F.3d at 1019-20 . In Napster, we considered claims that the
operator of an electronic file sharing system was contributorily liable for assisting individual users to swap copyrighted music
files stored on their home computers with other users of the system. Napster,239 F.3d at 1011-13 , 1019-22. We stated that
""if a computer system operator learns of specific infringing material available on his system and fails to purge such material
from the system, the operator knows of and contributes to direct infringement."" /d. at 1021. Because Napster knew of the
availability of infringing music files, assisted users in accessing such files, and failed to block access to such files, we

concluded that Napster materially contributed to infringement. /d. at 1022.

The Napster test for contributory liability was modeled on the influential district court decision in Religious Technology
Center v. Netcom On-Line Communication Services, Inc. (Netcom), 907 F.Supp. 1361 , 1365-66 (N.D.Cal.1995). See
Napster, 239 F.3d at 1021 . In Netcom, a disgruntled former Scientology minister posted allegedly infringing copies of

Scientological works on an electronic bulletin board service. Netcom, 907 F.Supp. at 1365-66 . The messages were stored
on the bulletin board operator's computer, then automatically copied onto Netcom's computer, and from there copied onto

other computers comprising ""a worldwide community"" of electronic bulletin board systems. /d. at 1366-67 & n. 4 (internal
quotation omitted). Netcom held that if plaintiffs

[508 F.3d 1172]

could prove that Netcom knew or should have known that the minister infringed plaintiffs' copyrights, ""Netcom [would] be
liable for contributory infringement since its failure to simply cancel [the former minister's] infringing message and thereby
stop an infringing copy from being distributed worldwide constitute[d] substantial participation in [the former minister's] public
distribution of the message."" /d. at 1374.

Although neither Napster nor Netcom expressly required a finding of intent, those cases are consistent with Grokster
because both decisions ruled that a service provider's knowing failure to prevent infringing actions could be the basis for
imposing contributory liability. Under such circumstances, intent may be imputed. In addition, Napster and Netcom are
consistent with the longstanding requirement that an actor's contribution to infringement must be material to warrant the


--- Page 12 ---
imposition of contributory liability. Gershwin, 443 F.2d at 1162 . Both Napster and Netcom acknowledge that services or
products that facilitate access to websites throughout the world can significantly magnify the effects of otherwise immaterial
infringing activities. See Napster,239 F.3d at 1022 ; Netcom, 907 F.Supp. at 1375 . The Supreme Court has acknowledged
that ""[t]he argument for imposing indirect liability"" is particularly ""powerful"" when individuals using the defendant's software
could make a huge number of infringing downloads every day. Grokster, 545 U.S. at 929 , 125 S.Ct. 2764 . Moreover,
copyright holders cannot protect their rights in a meaningful way unless they can hold providers of such services or products
accountable for their actions pursuant to a test such as that enunciated in Napster. See id. at 929-30, 125 S.Ct. 2764 (""When
a widely shared service or product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected
work effectively against all direct infringers, the only practical alternative being to go against the distributor of the copying
device for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.""). Accordingly, we hold that a computer
system operator can be held contributorily liable if it ""has actua/ knowledge that specific infringing material is available using
its system,"" Napster,_239 F.3d at 1022 , and can ""take simple measures to prevent further damage"" to copyrighted works,
Netcom, _907 F.Supp. at 1375 , yet continues to provide access to infringing works.

Here, the district court held that even assuming Google had actual knowledge of infringing material available on its
system, Google did not materially contribute to infringing conduct because it did not undertake any substantial promotional
or advertising efforts to encourage visits to infringing websites, nor provide a significant revenue stream to the infringing
websites. Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 854-56 . This analysis is erroneous. There is no dispute that Google substantially
assists websites to distribute their infringing copies to a worldwide market and assists a worldwide audience of users to
access infringing materials. We cannot discount the effect of such a service on copyright owners, even though Google's
assistance is available to all websites, not just infringing ones. Applying our test, Google could be held contributorily liable if
it had knowledge that infringing Perfect 10 images were available using its search engine, could take simple measures to
prevent further damage to Perfect 10's copyrighted works, and failed to take such steps.

The district court did not resolve the factual disputes over the adequacy of Perfect 10's notices to Google and Google's
responses to these notices. Moreover, there are factual disputes over whether there are reasonable and feasible means for
Google to refrain from providing access

[508 F.3d 1173]

to infringing images. Therefore, we must remand this claim to the district court for further consideration whether Perfect 10
would likely succeed in establishing that Google was contributorily liable for in-line linking to full-size infringing images under
the test enunciated today. 1%

B. Vicarious Infringement

Perfect 10 also challenges the district court's conclusion that it is not likely to prevail on a theory of vicarious liability
against Google. Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 856-58 . Grokster states that one ""infringes vicariously by profiting from direct
infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it."" Grokster,545 U.S. at 930 , 125 S.Ct. 2764 . As this
formulation indicates, to succeed in imposing vicarious liability, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant exercises the
requisite control over the direct infringer and that the defendant derives a direct financial benefit from the direct infringement.
See id. Grokster further explains the ""control"" element of the vicarious liability test as the defendant's ""right and ability to
supervise the direct infringer."" /d. at 930 n. 9, 125 S.Ct. 2764 . Thus, under Grokster, a defendant exercises control over a
direct infringer when he has both a legal right to stop or limit the directly infringing conduct, as well as the practical ability to
do so.

We evaluate Perfect 10's arguments that Google is vicariously liable in light of the direct infringement that is undisputed
by the parties, namely, the third-party websites’ reproduction, display, and distribution of unauthorized copies of Perfect 10's
images on the Internet. Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 852 ; see supra Section IV.A. In order to prevail at this preliminary
injunction stage, Perfect 10 must demonstrate a likelihood of success in establishing that Google has the right and ability to
stop or limit the infringing activities of third party websites. In addition, Perfect 10 must establish a likelihood of proving that
Google derives a direct financial benefit from such activities. Perfect 10 has not met this burden.

With respect to the ""control"" element set forth in Grokster, Perfect 10 has not demonstrated a likelihood of showing that
Google has the legal right to stop or limit the direct infringement of third-party websites. See Grokster, 545 U.S. at 930 , 125
S.Ct. 2764 . Unlike Fonovisa, where by virtue of a ""broad contract"" with its vendors the defendant swap meet operators had
the right to stop the vendors from selling counterfeit recordings on its premises, Fonovisa,76 F.3d at 263 , Perfect 10 has
not shown that Google has contracts with third-party websites that empower Google to stop or limit them from reproducing,
displaying, and distributing infringing copies of Perfect 10's images on the Internet. Perfect 10 does point to Google's
AdSense agreement, which states that Google reserves ""the right to monitor and terminate partnerships with entities that

violate others’ copyright[s]."" Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 858 . However, Google's right to terminate an AdSense
partnership does not give Google the right to

[508 F.3d 1174]

stop direct infringement by third-party websites. An infringing third-party website can continue to reproduce, display, and
distribute its infringing copies of Perfect 10 images after its participation in the AdSense program has ended.


--- Page 13 ---
Nor is Google similarly situated to Napster. Napster users infringed the plaintiffs’ reproduction and distribution rights
through their use of Napster's proprietary music-file sharing system. Napster,239 F.3d at 1011-14 . There, the infringing
conduct was the use of Napster's ""service to download and upload copyrighted music."" /d. at 1014 (internal quotation
omitted). Because Napster had a closed system requiring user registration, and could terminate its users' accounts and
block their access to the Napster system, Napster had the right and ability to prevent its users from engaging in the
infringing activity of uploading file names and downloading Napster users' music files through the Napster system. '4 /d. at
1023-24. By contrast, Google cannot stop any of the third-party websites from reproducing, displaying, and distributing
unauthorized copies of Perfect 10's images because that infringing conduct takes place on the third-party websites. Google
cannot terminate those third-party websites or block their ability to ""host and serve infringing full-size images"" on the
Internet. Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 831 .

Moreover, the district court found that Google lacks the practical ability to police the third-party websites’ infringing
conduct. /d. at 857-58. Specifically, the court found that Google's supervisory power is limited because ""Google's software
lacks the ability to analyze every image on the [I]nternet, compare each image to all the other copyrighted images that exist

in the world ... and determine whether a certain image on the web infringes someone's copyright."" /d. at 858. The district
court also concluded that Perfect 10's suggestions regarding measures Google could implement to prevent its web crawler

from indexing infringing websites and to block access to infringing images were not workable. /d. at 858 n. 25. Rather, the
suggestions suffered from both ""imprecision and overbreadth."" /d. We hold that these findings are not clearly erroneous.
Without image-recognition technology, Google lacks the practical ability to police the infringing activities of third-party
websites. This distinguishes Google from the defendants held liable in Napster and Fonovisa. See Napster,_239 F.3d at
1023-24 (Napster had the ability to identify and police infringing conduct by searching its index for song titles); Fonovisa,76
F.3d at 262 (swap meet operator had the ability to identify and police infringing activity by patrolling its premises).

Perfect 10 argues that Google could manage its own operations to avoid
[508 F.3d 1175]

indexing websites with infringing content and linking to third-party infringing sites. This is a claim of contributory liability, not
vicarious liability. Although ""the lines between direct infringement, contributory infringement, and vicarious liability are not
clearly drawn,"" Sony, 464 U.S. at 435 n. 17, 104 S.Ct. 774 (internal quotation omitted), in general, contributory liability is
based on the defendant's failure to stop its own actions which facilitate third-party infringement, while vicarious liability is
based on the defendant's failure to cause a third party to stop its directly infringing activities. See, e.g., Ellison,_357 F.3d at
1077-78 ; Fonovisa,76 F.3d at 261-64 . Google's failure to change its operations to avoid assisting websites to distribute

their infringing content may constitute contributory liability, see supra Section IV.A. However, this failure is not the same as
declining to exercise a right and ability to make third-party websites stop their direct infringement. We reject Perfect 10's
efforts to blur this distinction.

Because we conclude that Perfect 10 has not shown a likelihood of establishing Google's right and ability to stop or
limit the directly infringing conduct of third-party websites, we agree with the district court's conclusion that Perfect 10 ""has

not established a likelihood of proving the [control] prong necessary for vicarious liability."" Perfect 10,416 F.Supp.2d at 858 .
15

C. Digital Millennium Copyright Act

Google claims that it qualifies for the limitations on liability set forth in title Il of the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. § 512. In particular,
section 512(d) limits the liability of a service provider ""for infringement of copyright by reason of the provider referring or
linking users to an online location containing infringing material or infringing activity, by using information location tools,
including a directory, index, reference, pointer, or hypertext link"" if the service provider meets certain criteria. We have held
that the limitations on liability contained in 17 U.S.C. § 512 protect secondary infringers as well as direct infringers. Napster,
239 F.3d at 1025 .

The parties dispute whether Google meets the specified criteria. Perfect 10 claims that it sent qualifying notices to
Google and Google did not act expeditiously to remove the infringing material. Google claims that Perfect 10's notices did
not comply with the notice provisions of section 512 and were not adequate to inform Google of the location of the infringing
images on the Internet or identify the underlying copyrighted work. Google also claims that it responded to all notices it
received by investigating the webpages identified by Perfect 10 and suppressing links to any webpages that Google
confirmed were infringing.

Because the district court determined that Perfect 10 was unlikely to succeed on its contributory and vicarious liability
claims, it did not reach Google's arguments under section 512. In revisiting the question of Perfect 10's likelihood of success
on its contributory infringement claims, the district court should also consider whether Google would likely succeed in
showing that it was entitled to the limitations on injunctive relief provided by title Il of the DMCA.

Vv
Amazon.com

Perfect 10 claims that Amazon.com displays and distributes Perfect 10's copyrighted images and is also secondarily


--- Page 14 ---
[508 F.3d 1176]

liable for the infringements of third-party websites and Amazon.com users. The district court concluded that Perfect 10 was
unlikely to succeed in proving that Amazon.com was a direct infringer, because it merely in-line linked to the thumbnails on
Google's servers and to the full-size images on third-party websites. '* Perfect 10 v. Amazon, No. 05-4753, consolidated
with 04-9484 (C.D.Cal. February 21, 2006) (order denying preliminary injunction). In addition, the district court concluded
that Perfect 10's secondary infringement claims against Amazon.com were likely to fail because Amazon.com had no
program analogous to AdSense, and thus did not provide any revenues to infringing sites. /d. Finally, the district court
determined that Amazon.com's right and ability to control the infringing conduct of third-party websites was substantially less
than Google's. /d. Therefore, the district court denied Perfect 10's motion for a preliminary injunction against Amazon.com.
Id.

We agree that Perfect 10 has not shown a likelihood that it would prevail on the merits of its claim that Amazon.com
directly infringed its images. Amazon.com communicates to its users only the HTML instructions that direct the users’
browsers to Google's computers (for thumbnail images) or to a third party's computer (for full-size infringing images).
Therefore, Amazon.com does not display or distribute a copy of the thumbnails or full-size images to its users.

We also agree with the district court's conclusion that Amazon.com does not have ""the right and ability to supervise the
infringing activity"" of Google or third parties. The district court did not clearly err in concluding that Amazon.com lacked a
direct financial interest in such activities. Therefore, Perfect 10's claim that Amazon.com is vicariously liable for third-party
infringement is unlikely to succeed.

However, the district court did not consider whether Amazon.com had "" actual knowledge that specific infringing
material is available using its system,"" Napster,_239 F.3d at 1022 (emphasis in original), and could have ""take[n] simple
measures to prevent further damage"" to copyrighted works, Netcom, 907 F.Supp. at 1375 , yet continued to provide access
to infringing works. Perfect 10 has presented evidence that it notified Amazon.com that it was facilitating its users' access to
infringing material. It is disputed whether the notices gave Amazon.com actual knowledge of specific infringing activities
available using its system, and whether Amazon.com could have taken reasonable and feasible steps to refrain from
providing access to such images, but failed to do so. Nor did the district court consider whether Amazon.com is entitled to
limit its liability under title Il of the DMCA. On remand, the district court should consider Amazon.com's potential contributory
liability, as well as possible limitations on the scope of injunctive relief, in light of our rulings today.

Vi

We conclude that Google's fair use defense is likely to succeed at trial, and therefore we reverse the district court's
determination that Google's thumbnail versions of Perfect 10's images likely constituted a direct infringement. The district
court also erred in its secondary liability

[508 F.3d 1177]

analysis because it failed to consider whether Google and Amazon.com knew of infringing activities yet failed to take
reasonable and feasible steps to refrain from providing access to infringing images. Therefore we must also reverse the
district court's holding that Perfect 10 was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its secondary liability claims. Due to this error,
the district court did not consider whether Google and Amazon.com are entitled to the limitations on liability set forth in title II
of the DMCA. The question whether Google and Amazon.com are secondarily liable, and whether they can limit that liability
pursuant to title Il of the DMCA, raise fact-intensive inquiries, potentially requiring further fact finding, and thus can best be
resolved by the district court on remand. We therefore remand this matter to the district court for further proceedings
consistent with this decision.

Because the district court will need to reconsider the appropriate scope of injunctive relief after addressing these
secondary liability issues, we do not address the parties' arguments regarding the scope of the injunction issued by the
district court. For the same reason, we do not address the parties’ dispute over whether the district court abused its
discretion in determining that Perfect 10 satisfied the irreparable harm element of a preliminary injunction.

Therefore, we reverse the district court's ruling and vacate the preliminary injunction regarding Google's use of
thumbnail versions of Perfect 10's images. '” We reverse the district court's rejection of the claims that Google and
Amazon.com are secondarily liable for infringement of Perfect 10's full-size images. We otherwise affirm the rulings of the
district court. We remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party shall bear its own costs
on appeal. See FED. R. APP. P. 39(a)(4).

AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; REMANDED.

Notes:

1. Google argues that we lack jurisdiction over the preliminary injunction to the extent it enforces unregistered copyrights. Registration is generally a
jurisdictional prerequisite to a suit for copyright infringement. See 17 U.S.C. § 411. But section 411 does not limit the remedies a court can grant. Rather,
the Copyright Act gives courts broad authority to issue injunctive relief. See 17 U.S.C. § 502(a). Once a court has jurisdiction over an action for copyright
infringement under section 411, the court may grant injunctive relief to restrain infringement of any copyright, whether registered or unregistered. See,


--- Page 15 ---
e.g., Olan Mills, Inc. v. Linn Photo Co., 23 F.3d 1345 , 1349 (8th Cir.1994); Pac. & S. Co., Inc. v. Duncan, 744 F.2d 1490 , 1499 n. 17 (11th Cir.1984).
Because at least some of the Perfect 10 images at issue were registered, the district court did not err in determining that it could issue an order that
covers unregistered works. Therefore, we have jurisdiction over the district court's decision and order.

2. The website publisher may not actually store the photographic images used on its webpages in its own computer, but may provide HTML instructions
directing the user's browser to some further computer that stores the image. Because this distinction does not affect our analysis, for convenience, we
will assume that the website publisher stores all images used on its webpages in the website publisher's own computer.

3. Generally, a ""cache"" is ""a computer memory with very short access time used for storage of frequently or recently used instructions or data."" United
States v. Ziegler, 474 F.3d 1184 , 1186 n. 3 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 171 (11th ed.2003)). There are
two types of caches at issue in this case. A user's personal computer has an internal cache that saves copies of webpages and images that the user has
recently viewed so that the user can more rapidly revisit these webpages and images. Google's computers also have a cache which serves a variety of
purposes. Among other things, Google's cache saves copies of a large number of webpages so that Google's search engine can efficiently organize and
index these webpages.

4. Perfect 10 argues that we are bound by the language and structure of title Il of the DMCA in determining Google's liability for copyright infringement.
We have noted that the DMCA does not change copyright law; rather, ""Congress provided that [the DMCA's] limitations of liability apply if the provider is
found to be liable under existing principles of law."" Ellison, 357 F.3d at 1077 (emphasis and internal quotation omitted). As a result, ""[c]laims against
service providers for direct, contributory, or vicarious copyright infringement, therefore, are generally evaluated just as they would be in the non-online
world."" /d. ; see also 17 U.S.C. § 512( /) (""The failure of a service provider's conduct to qualify for limitation of liability under this section shall not bear
adversely upon the consideration of a defense by the service provider that the service provider's conduct is not infringing under this title or any other
defense.""). Therefore, we must consider Google's potential liability under the Copyright Act without reference to title Il of the DMCA.

5. 17 U.S.C. § 106 states, in pertinent part:
Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:

(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;

(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;

(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the
individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly....

6. Because Google initiates and controls the storage and communication of these thumbnail images, we do not address whether an entity that merely
passively owns and manages an Internet bulletin board or similar system violates a copyright owner's display and distribution rights when the users of the
bulletin board or similar system post infringing works. Cf. CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc., 373 F.3d 544 (4th Cir.2004) .

7. Perfect 10 also argues that Google violates Perfect 10's right to display full-size images because Google's in-line linking meets the Copyright Act's
definition of ""to perform or display a work ‘publicly. 17 U.S.C. § 101. This phrase means ""to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or
display of the work to ... the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or
display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times."" /d. Perfect 10 is mistaken. Google's activities do not
meet this definition because Google transmits or communicates only an address which directs a user's browser to the location where a copy of the full-
size image is displayed. Google does not communicate a display of the work itself.

8. We reject at the outset Perfect 10's argument that providing access to infringing websites cannot be deemed transformative and is inherently not fair
use. Perfect 10 relies on_Video Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista Home Entm't, Inc., 342 F.3d 191 (3d Cir.2003) , and_Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of Am.
Inc., 975 F.2d 832 , 843 (Fed.Cir.1992). But these cases, in essence, simply apply the general rule that a party claiming fair use must act in a manner
generally compatible with principles of good faith and fair dealing. See Harper & Row,_471 U.S. at 562-63 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . For this reason, a company
whose business is based on providing scenes from copyrighted movies without authorization could not claim that it provided the same public benefit as
the search engine in Kelly. See Video Pipeline, 342 F.3d at 198-200 . Similarly, a company whose overriding desire to replicate a competitor's computer
game led it to obtain a copy of the competitor's source code from the Copyright Office under false pretenses could not claim fair use with respect to its
purloined copy. Atari Games,_975 F.2d at 843 .

Unlike the alleged infringers in Video Pipeline and Atari Games, who intentionally misappropriated the copyright owners’ works for the purpose of
commercial exploitation, Google is operating a comprehensive search engine that only incidentally indexes infringing websites. This incidental impact
does not amount to an abuse of the good faith and fair dealing underpinnings of the fair use doctrine. Accordingly, we conclude that Google's inclusion of
thumbnail images derived from infringing websites in its Internet-wide search engine activities does not preclude Google from raising a fair use defense.

9. Google contends that Perfect 10's photographic images are less creative and less deserving of protection than the images of the American West in
Kelly because Perfect 10 boasts of its un-retouched photos showing the natural beauty of its models. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the
district court's finding that Perfect 10's photographs ""consistently reflect professional, skillful, and sometimes tasteful artistry"" is not clearly erroneous.
Perfect 10, 416 F.Supp.2d at 849 n. 15. We agree with the district court that there is no basis for concluding that photos of the American West are more
deserving of protection than photos of nude models. See id.

10. Because the district court concluded that Perfect 10 was likely to prevail on its direct infringement claim with respect to Google's use of thumbnails,
but not with respect to its in-line linking to full-size images, the district court considered Google's potential secondary liability only on the second issue.

11. Google's activities do not meet the ""inducement"" test explained in Grokster because Google has not promoted the use of its search engine
specifically to infringe copyrights. See Grokster, 545 U.S. at 935-37 , 125 S.Ct. 2764 . However, the Supreme Court in Grokster did not suggest that a
court must find inducement in order to impose contributory liability under common law principles.

12. ""Cyberspace is a popular term for the world of electronic communications over computer networks."" Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Netcom On-Line
Comme'n Servs., Inc., 907 F.Supp. 1361 , 1365 n. 1 (N.D.Cal.1995).

13. Perfect 10 claims that Google materially contributed to infringement by linking to websites containing unauthorized passwords, which enabled Google
users to access Perfect 10's website and make infringing copies of images. However, Perfect 10 points to no evidence that users logging onto the Perfect
10 site with unauthorized passwords infringed Perfect 10's exclusive rights under section 106. In the absence of evidence that Google's actions led to


--- Page 16 ---
any direct infringement, this argument does not assist Perfect 10 in establishing that it would prevail on the merits of its contributory liability claim. See
Napster,_239 F.3d at 1013 n. 2 (""Secondary liability for copyright infringement does not exist in the absence of direct infringement by a third party."").

14. Napster's system included ""Napster's MusicShare software, available free of charge from Napster's Internet site, and Napster's network servers and
server-side software."" Napster,_239 F.3d at 1011 . By downloading Napster's MusicShare software to the user's personal computer, and registering with
the Napster system, a user could both upload and download music files. /d. at 1011-13. If the Napster user uploaded a list of music files stored on the
user's personal computer to the Napster system, such music files would be automatically available to other Napster users whenever the user was logged
on to the Napster system. /d. at 1012. In addition, the Napster user could download music files directly from other users’ personal computers. /d. We
explained the infringing conduct as ""Napster users who upload file names to the [Napster] search index for others to copy violate plaintiffs’ distribution
rights. Napster users who download files [through the Napster system] containing copyrighted music violate plaintiffs’ reproduction rights."" /d. at 1014.

15. Having so concluded, we need not reach Perfect 10's argument that Google received a direct financial benefit.

16. Amazon.com states that it ended its relationship with Google on April 30, 2006. Perfect 10's action for preliminary injunction against Amazon.com is
not moot, however, because Amazon.com has not established ""that the allegedly wrongful behavior cannot reasonably be expected to recur."" F.T.C. v.
Affordable Media, LLC, 179 F.3d 1228 , 1238 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotation omitted).

17. Because we vacate the injunction, Google's motion for stay of the injunction is moot.

ORDER GRANTING PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT

William Alsup, United States District Judge
Introduction

In this copyright infringement action involving thumbnail images of nude models, defendants move for partial summary
judgment. For the reasons stated below, the motion is Granted.

[962 F.Supp.2d 1150]

Statement
1. The Parties.

Plaintiff Perfect 10, Inc., a California corporation, creates copyrighted adult entertainment products, including
photographs. Perfect 10 owns and operates the subscription-based internet website perfect10.com. For the purposes of this
motion, Perfect 10's ownership of all copyrights at issue in this action is not contested (Br. 10 n.5).

Defendant Yandex N.V., a Dutch holding company headquartered in the Netherlands, owns a family of companies
under the “Yandex” brand. It does not itself own or operate any internet search engines or websites that host user-generated
content. It manages its investments, including its subsidiaries, defendants Yandex LLC and Yandex Inc. ( id. at 2).
Subsidiary Yandex LLC is a Russian technology company which operates yandex.ru, Russia's most popular search engine.
Subsidiary Yandex Inc., a Delaware corporation located in Palo Alto, provides software-development services to Yandex
LLC. Yandex Inc. does not own or operate any search engines or websites that host user-generated content. It does,
however, own servers in Nevada, which hosted the search index for Yandex LLC's international version of its search engine
(yandex.com) for nine months in 2012-2013 ( ibid. ).

A. Yandex LLC's Search Engines.
(1) Yandex.ru.

The yandex.ru search engine is Russia's most popular search engine and the fourth largest search engine worldwide. It
functions as follows. A user can query either a web or image search. When a user types in a query, the search engine
references a search index, which is a database of all the words or images known to the search engine and their locations.
When a user searches for an image by typing in text, the search engine analyzes the text and then determines whether a
given image in its search index fits the user query ( id. at 3).

Yandex.ru's image search index is compiled by “crawlers” that periodically canvas the world-wide internet for images. It
does not copy and store full-sized copies of the images it finds but rather distills and stores smaller, lower-resolution
thumbnail-sized copies. The storage occurs on its servers. It reproduces its thumbnail copies on search results pages so that
the user can determine which, if any, thumbnails are hits. The user can then click through to the third-party website that
hosts the full-sized image. Yandex.ru also allows users to place ads and click on ads. (This is also the way crawlers work for
popular search engines based in the United States.)

Because yandex.ru is a Cyrillic-language search engine, it typically crawls Russian-language websites, which are
normally hosted outside of the United States. The yandex.ru index has always been hosted on Russian servers. Yandex.ru
does not save data regarding where a user goes next after leaving the search-results page.


--- Page 2 ---
(2) Yandex.com.

Yandex.com is a search engine that provides English and other Latin-alphabet based search results. Like yandex.ru, it
offers both an image search and a web search and generates its search results in the same manner. It does not store full-
sized copies of its images on its server but rather thumbnail copies. Like yandex.ru, yandex.com does not save data
regarding where a user goes after leaving the yandex.com search-results page. But there are differences. Unlike yandex.ru,
yandex.com crawls for internet content using Latin-alphabet based terms, has no advertising anywhere on its site, and was
physically hosted in the United States for a

[962 F.Supp.2d 1151]

period of nine months, between June 2012 and March 2013 (whereas yandex.ru has always been physically hosted on
servers in Russia). Outside of that nine-month window, yandex.com was hosted in Russia like yandex.ru. This civil action
was commenced in March 2012.

B. Yandex LLC's User-Generated Content Services.

Yandex LLC hosts several popular Russian-language services that host user-generated content. Narod.ru is a
Russian-language site-hosting service where users can build and host their own websites (like Wordpress). Fotiki.ru is a
Russian-language photo-hosting service and online community similar to Shutterfly. Ya.ur is a blog-hosting service.
Moikrug.ru is a social network for professionals. All of these services are hosted entirely on servers located in Russia.
Yandex does not track the IP addresses associated with user uploads or downloads on any of these services and so it does
not know where—geographically—uploads are coming from or downloads are going to. Yandex LLC also does not track
“right-click” user activity data on any of its user-generated content services, so Yandex LLC does not know if users right-
click on images and save them on their computers, and thus does not know if users in the United States download the
images it hosts.

2. Perfect 10's Claims..

Perfect 10 has brought direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement claims against Yandex N.V., Yandex,
Inc., and Yandex LLC. Perfect 10's first amended complaint refers to them collectively as “Yandex” because “they are
inextricably involved in the operation of yandex.com and yandex.ru” (Dkt. No. 88 at 2).

Perfect 10's direct copyright infringement claims are as follows: (1) narod.ru (site-hosting) and fotki.ru (photo-hosting)
services hosted full-sized copies of user-uploaded infringing

[962 F.Supp.2d 1152]

Perfect 10 images; (2) yandex.ru and yandex.com hosted infringing thumbnail-sized copies of Perfect 10 images and linked
them to Yandex-created pages that display similar full-sized versions of the images often adjacent to Yandex ads (First
Amd. Compl. 9§ 23-27; Br. 2-3; Opp. 5-6).

Perfect 10's contributory copyright infringement claims are as follows: (1) Yandex.ru linked to third-party sites that
hosted full-sized infringing copies of Perfect 10's images; (2) Yandex.com linked to third-party websites that hosted full-sized
infringing copies of Perfect 10's images; (3) Yandex LLC's user-generated content sites allowed users to upload and
download infringing copies of Perfect 10's images.

Perfect 10's vicarious copyright infringement claims against Yandex N.V. are based on the allegations of direct and
contributory infringement purportedly committed by Yandex LLC and Yandex Inc.

According to defendants, in a series of DMCA notices sent to Yandex Perfect 10 identified 63,756 URLs from Yandex
search results pages linking to allegedly infringing Perfect 10 images hosted on third-party websites. Perfect 10 furthermore
asserted 1,474 acts of direct infringement based on Narod, Fotki, Ya.ru and Moikrug.ru's hosting of Perfect 10 images
uploaded by third-parties (Br. at 6).

During discovery in this action, both Perfect 10 and Yandex have used widely-available geo-location tools. These
software tools obtain IP addresses (the numeral labels assigned to computing devices) which can then used to determine,
among other things, the country in which device is located. This is important because legal liability is tied to the location of
servers and storage media used to capture the images. Perfect 10 has used geo-location tools to determine the owners and
hosts of various websites that display allegedly infringing Perfect 10 images. Yandex used geo-location tools to obtain IP
addresses and corresponding geo-locations of all 63,756 allegedly infringing URLs which Perfect 10 alleged yandex.com
and/or yandex.ru linked to in their search results.

Of the 63,756 alleged infringements to which yandex.com and/or yandex.ru linked in search results, Yandex contends
that 51,959 of them were hosted on servers located outside of the United States and 50,485 concerned content hosted by
third-party websites. The remaining 1,474 of the 51,959 URLs located outside of the United States concern content
uploaded by Yandex users to Narod.ru, Fotki.ru, Ya.ru and Moikrug.ru accounts hosted by Yandex LLC, all of which are

located on servers in Russia ( id. at 7).

Yandex served discovery requests asking Perfect 10 to produce all documents showing the location of the direct


--- Page 3 ---
infringements on which the contributory and vicarious claims are based. Perfect 10 directed Yandex to documents that
claimed to show infringement hosted in the United States. Perfect 10 did not, however, produce evidence of direct
infringement in the United States relevant to the location of the 51,959 alleged infringements hosted on servers outside the
United States. Furthermore, Perfect 10 did not provide evidence of direct infringement in the United States relevant to the
1,474 alleged infringements based on user-generated content hosted by Yandex ( id. at 7-8).

Yandex now moves for partial summary judgment on the issues of (1) whether Perfect 10 images hosted on Yandex
services located abroad are direct infringements; (2) whether Yandex's thumbnail versions of Perfect 10 images hosted on
servers in the United States for a nine-month period in 2012-13 constituted fair use; (3) whether Yandex is contributorily
liable for linking to Perfect 10 images hosted by extraterritorial third parties; and (4) vicarious liability. Both parties have
submitted briefing on the motion, and oral argument was held on July 11, 2013.

Analysis

Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings and the evidence in the record “show that there is no genuine dispute
as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FRCP 56(a). A dispute is
genuine only if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact-finder to find for the non-moving party, and material only if
the fact may affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 , 248-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91
L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) .

1. Direct Infringement Claim.

It is a well-established principle that, as a general rule, the Copyright Act has no extraterritorial application. Minden
Pictures, Inc. v. Pearson Educ., Inc., No. 11-5385—WHA, 2013 WL 71774, at *1 (N.D.Cal. Jan. 7, 2013), citing L.A. News
Serv. v. Reuters Television Int'l, Lid.. 149 F.3d 987 , 990 (9th Cir.1998). “Because the copyright laws do not apply
extraterritorially, each of the rights conferred under the five section 106 categories must be read as extending no farther than
the United States’ borders.... [They] do not reach acts of infringement that take place entirely abroad.” Subafilms , Ltd. v.
MGM-Pathe Comm'n s Co., 24 F.3d 1088 , 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.1994).

To present a prima facie case of direct infringement, a plaintiff:

(1) ... must show ownership of the allegedly infringed material and (2) they must demonstrate that the alleged infringers
violate at least one exclusive right granted to copyright holders under 17 U.S.C. § 106. Even if a plaintiff satisfies these two
requirements and

[962 F.Supp.2d 1153]

makes a prima facie case of direct infringement, the defendant may avoid liability if it can establish that its use of the images
is a “fair use” as set forth in 17 U.S.C. § 107.

Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 508 F.3d 1146 , 1159 (9th Cir.2007).

A. Servers Outside the United States.

Yandex moves for summary judgment on Perfect 10's direct infringement claims “premised on the 1,474 acts of alleged
infringement concerning user-generated content [i.e. user-uploaded Perfect 10 images] hosted on Yandex's narod.ru,
fotki.ru, ya.ru, and moikrug.ru services.” Yandex argues that the evidence is undisputed that these Yandex services are, and
have always been, hosted on servers in Russia. The “server test” applied by our court of appeals makes the hosting
website's computer, rather than the search engine's computer, the situs of direct copyright infringement liability. Amazon,
508 F.3d at 1159 -60. Therefore, Yandex argues, these foreign-hosted images are extraterritorial and not actionable under
the Act. This order agrees.

Perfect 10 does not contest that the servers for these Yandex services are located in Russia. Rather, Perfect 10
objects that Fotki and Narod.Ru (and presumably Yandex's other, similar sites) commit “direct infringement by display.”
According to Perfect 10, when its images are hosted on servers located in Russia, Yandex violates Perfect 10's “exclusive
display right” because users in the United States could download them. Perfect 10 supplies declarations establishing that a
United States user could download Perfect 10 images from a Yandex server in Russia, but no evidence of actua/ downloads
in the United States.

This theory of liability is rejected. Although Perfect 10 cites Amazon in support of its argument, nowhere in that decision
did our court of appeals endorse the idea that display of a copyrighted image anywhere in the world creates direct copyright
liability in the United States merely because the image could be downloaded from a server abroad by someone in the United
States. Such a principle would destroy the concept of territoriality inherent in the Copyright Act for works on the internet.

In a more plausible variation of this argument, Perfect 10 points out that when Yandex's servers were located in the
United States for a nine-month period, a Yandex.com image search performed by a server in the United States could have

linked to a Perfect 10 image hosted on a Yandex server in Russia. Perfect 10 argues that Yandex should not escape direct
copyright liability by international distribution of its hosting and searching servers.


--- Page 4 ---
It is not necessary to address the validity of this theory merits. It fails for lack of proof. Perfect 10 does not demonstrate
that Yandex in fact stored or displayed full-sized copies of the Perfect 10 images on Yandex's United States servers. (The
issue of thumbnail versions of Perfect 10 images stored on Yandex servers in the United States will be addressed below.)
Perfect 10 only submits that “Yandex suggests it keeps duplicate copies of images on all of its servers ... so full-size Perfect
10 images may very well have been stored on yandex.com's U.S. servers” (Dkt. No. 167 at 24 (citation omitted, emphasis
added)). Perfect 10's speculation that full-size image storage may have occurred in the United States is insufficient at the
summary judgment stage, which is the point in litigation to stand and deliver on admissible evidence. Nor is there any
evidence of an effort by Yandex to intentionally circumvent copyright liability through clever placement of its servers or
through manipulation of the corporate form.

[962 F.Supp.2d 1154]

This order accordingly holds that Yandex's hosting of full-sized Perfect 10 images on servers in Russia does not
constitute direct copyright infringement in the United States. To this extent, Yandex's motion for partial summary judgment is
Granted .4+

B. Servers Inside the United States.

Yandex concedes that during the nine-month period from June 2012 to March 2013 when Yandex.com servers were
located in the United States, Yandex stored thumbnail versions of Perfect 10 images within the territorial reach of the
Copyright Act. Yandex does not dispute that Perfect 10 owned (and owns still) the copyrights in the images it asserts, nor
the basic proposition that Yandex's use of the thumbnails violated Perfect 10's display and distribution rights in these

images. Thus, this order assumes that Perfect 10 can make out a prima facie case of direct infringement based on these

thumbnails. The burden then shifts to Yandex to show that its thumbnail copies constituted fair use. See Amazon, 508 F.3d
at 1158 . This order holds that Yandex has met its burden2

The fair use defense is codified in 17 U.S.C. § 107, which states:
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by
reproduction in copies ... for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for

classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work
in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

This order is guided by the decision of our court of appeals in Amazon (which involved the same plaintiff, similar facts,
and itself relied on an analogous fact pattern in Kelly v. Arriba Soft, 336 F.3d 811 (9th Cir.2003) ).

Regarding the first factor, “[t]he central purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether and to what extent the new work

is ‘transformative.’ ” Amazon, 508 F.3d at 1164 . Our court of appeals found inAmazon (and Kelly ) that using a thumbnail
image as a pointer to a source of information is highly transformative. So too here. Yandex's thumbnail versions served a
different function than Perfect 10's use: “improving access to information

[962 F.Supp.2d 1155]
on the Internet versus artistic expression.” /d. at 1165.

Perfect 10 objects that, unlike the Google search function at issue in Amazon, the yandex.com image search linked the
thumbnail directly to a larger version of the image, without including parts of the surrounding third-party web page,
concentrating its fire on a technique known as “in-line linking.” When a user of the yandex.com search service clicked on

one of the thumbnails, the full-size source image appeared in the same browser window. Significantly, although it appeared
as an integrated page, the full-size image was actually transmitted from the third-party website directly to the user's
computer—no copy was ever stored on yandex.com's servers. Put differently, the user would continue to see the Yandex

logo near the top of the screen (which came from the United States-based server) and would see on the rest of the screen a
full-size image of the nude model (which came from the third-party server).

It is true that this integrated composite screen left the impression that the nude model image emanated from Yandex,
but this objection fails for three reasons. First, our court of appeals expressly held that in-line linking to a full-size image does
not constitute direct infringement. /d. at 1159-60. Without a direct infringement of the full-size image, the fair use defense

does not come into play—at least as to that full-size image. Second, whether a browser window shows only the thumbnail
and the full-size image—instead of the full-size image along with part of the surrounding web page—does not affect whether


--- Page 5 ---
the use of the thumbnail has been transformed. Third, even if yandex.com's use of the thumbnail were broadly described as
an ‘in-line link connected to a full-size image,’ that use remains highly transformative.

Perfect 10 also objects that when the yandex.com thumbnail images in-line linked to full-size versions, the full-size
images were displayed beside commercial advertising. These objections are not supported by competent evidence. The
summary judgment record does not show that any of the yandex.com thumbnails (as opposed to thumbnails from Yandex
services in Russia) were used in connection with advertising. The storage of full-size images and use of advertising on the
yandex.ru website in Russia is irrelevant here.

Perfect 10 next argues that Yandex should not be permitted to benefit from the fair use defense because Yandex has
acted in bad faith. Specifically, Perfect 10 contends that because Yandex has objected to certain DMCA notices sent by
Perfect 10, Yandex should be precluded from relying on the fair use defense generally. This argument fails both because
Perfect 10 has not adduced evidence substantiating its allegation of bad faith, and because Perfect 10 fails to explain the
connection between its DMCA notices and Yandex's decision to use thumbnails in its search engine. Nor is there any
evidence that Yandex's use of Perfect 10 images for its thumbnails was targeted or pretextual.

Perfect 10 attempts to distinguish this action from Amazon by arguing that Yandex's search service (which was directed
towards English-speaking internet users in Russia) did not provide a public benefit for “Americans” (Dkt No. 167 at 10-11).
This argument is not persuasive. Amazon's discussion of the public benefit from internet search engines was not
constrained by whether they provided a particular benefit to the United States. Moreover, Perfect 10's argument is
contradicted by its own efforts to show that the Yandex's search service reached users in the United States ( see Opp. at 19
(stating that .5% of the

[962 F.Supp.2d 1156]

traffic to yandex.ru currently comes from the United States, which means that yandex.ru receives approximately 750,000
queries from U.S. users each day, or 22.5 million queries each month.)).

Regarding the second factor, Yandex argues that the nature of the copyrighted works is comparable to the images in
Amazon and in keeping with that decision should only slightly favor Perfect 10. Perfect 10 does not dispute this contention,
and this order agrees.

Regarding the third factor, Perfect 10 argues that the “amount and substantiality” analysis should favor Perfect 10
because Yandex allegedly used 40,000 Perfect 10 thumbnails, compared to approximately 1,500 used by Google in the
Amazon action. Perfect 10 confuses the nature of the substantiality analysis. It proceeds, like the concept of infringement,
on a copyright-by-copyright basis. Thus, the number of allegedly infringed images is not relevant. And, as noted above,
there is no evidence in the record that Yandex's enterprise was dedicated to circumvention of the Act. As in Amazon and
Kelly, this order concludes that the third factor favors neither party because the Yandex's transformative use required use of
the entire image, albeit in much reduced size. See Amazon, 508 F.3d at 1167 —68; Kelly, 336 F.3d at 821 .

As for the effect on the market for the original, Perfect 10 first contends that market harm should be presumed. In light
of Amazon, this argument is rejected because Yandex's use is transformative. See Amazon, 508 F.3d at 1168 .

Perfect 10 next contends that Yandex is responsible for “billions of unauthorized views and downloads of its images
from websites to which Yandex links Perfect 10 thumbnails” (Opp. 12 (emphasis removed)). Put differently, Perfect 10 is
arguing that Yandex causes it market harm because Yandex provides a search service that links to third-party infringers.
This argument is not substantiated by competent evidence. Perfect 10's putative support for this contention consists of
screen shots from third-party websites showing that links on those websites leading to Perfect 10 images had been viewed
approximately 3.8 million times as of December 2012 (which was within the nine-month period that yandex.com servers
were located in the United States). Perfect 10 does not, however, provide evidence that any of those views were the result
of yandex.com users clicking on thumbnails stored on yandex.com servers in the United States during that nine-month
period. The simple fact that the thumbnail links were stored in yandex.com's index and accessible on the internet does not
compel a finding that those links were actually viewed or used.

Perfect 10 also theorizes that user views of the 40,000 Perfect 10 thumbnails that were on the yandex.com site could
have been tracked by Yandex and then compared to statistics for users joining perfect10.com as paying members. Perfect
10 claims that such data “would likely show that millions of Yandex users have viewed Perfect 10 images at Yandex and
none have subscribed to Perfect 10” (Opp. 13). This is speculation, not proof.

Similarly, Perfect 10 contends that in Amazon our court of appeals recognized that there was a market for cell phone
downloads of reduced-size versions of Perfect 10 images back in 2007, but that the harm to this market was hypothetical at

the time. /d. at 1168. Pointing to the alleged loss of its cell phone download business in the ensuing years, Perfect 10 cries
foul. Perfect 10 reasons that the market for reduced-size images has dried up since 2007, and Yandex has began providing
a thumbnail search service since

[962 F.Supp.2d 1157]

2007; ergo, Perfect 10 has been harmed by Yandex. This simple correlation, without more, does not constitute sufficient


--- Page 6 ---
evidence that Yandex's use of 40,000 thumbnail images between June 2012 and March 2013 affected Perfect 10's market.
Significantly, in a prior litigation against Google, Perfect 10's president stated in a sworn declaration that Perfect 10's cell
phone download business “effectively ended in 2006.” Perfect 10, Inc. v. Google Inc., No. 2:04-cv-9484 (C.D.Cal.) (Dkt. No.
438, filed July 5, 2009).

In sum, there is no evidence in the record that Yandex.com’'s use of thumbnail versions of Perfect 10's image during a
nine-month period had any effect on the market for those same images. This order therefore concludes that this factor favors
neither party.

Taking a step back, this order must now consider the above factors together “in light of the purposes of copyright.” /bid .
As in Amazon, Yandex's significant transformative use must be weighed against the nature of the work, which weighs
slightly in favor of Perfect 10, and the neutral third and fourth factors. Upon due consideration, this order holds that
Yandex.com's thumbnails stored on its servers in the United States for a nine-month period were fair use.

2. Contributory Infringement Claim.

Now this order will return to the servers overseas, as well as those in the United States, and consider the claim of
contributory infringement, that is, the claim that those servers contributed to direct infringement by others within the United
States.

“One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement.” /d. at 1169, citing Metro—
Goldwyn— Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd..545 U.S. 913 , 930, 125 S.Ct. 2764 , 162 L.Ed.2d 781 (2005) . To establish
contributory liability, Perfect 10 must first establish direct infringement by third parties because secondary liability otherwise
cannot exist. Amazon, 508 F.3d at 1169 . For contributory infringement, the servers that matter are the servers where the
underlying direct infringement is occurred. As our court of appeals stated in Subafilms, “a primary activity outside the
boundaries of the United States, not constituting an infringement cognizable under the Copyright Act, cannot serve as the
basis for holding liable under the Copyright Act one who is merely related to that activity within the United States.”
Subafilms, 24 F.3d at 1093 , quoting 3 David Nimmer & Melville B. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 12.04 [A][3][b], at 12-86.
Thus, contributory liability can exist regardless of the location of the defendant's servers as long as the underlying direct
infringements occurred in the United States.

Yandex moves for summary judgment on approximately 50,000 yandex.com and yandex.ru links identified in Perfect
10's DMCA notices. The links connect to full-size versions hosted on third-party websites. Using the same geo-location tools
used by Perfect 10, Yandex demonstrates that the third-parties hosting the 50, 000 full-sized images are extraterritorial, and

Perfect 10 does not provide any evidence to the contrary .2Therefore, Yandex argues, the full-size images cannot constitute
direct infringement under the Copyright Act, and the Yandex.com links to them cannot contributorily infringe.

962 F.Supp.2d 1158]

This order agrees. To this extent, summary judgment is Granted .

Perfect 10 argues that our court of appeals held in Amazon that “a search engine like google.com or yandex.com
should be held contributorily liable under U.S. law when it provides links and user traffic to infringing websites regardless of
their ‘geographical location’ because it assists U.S. users in gaining access to the infringing materials offered by those
websites” (Opp. 15). This interpretation of Amazon is incorrect. Implicit in the passage in Amazon cited by Perfect 10 was
the notion that the prerequisite for contributory infringement—an act of direct infringement in the United States—was
satisfied. Amazon does not change the view adopted by our court of appeals in Subafilms : if third-party activity is
extraterritorial, it cannot directly infringe, and in turn there can be no contributory infringement. For the same reason, Perfect
10's insistence that the Yandex.com servers were located in the United States for a nine-month period does not change the
contributory liability analysis. Again, it must also be emphasized that there is no evidence that Yandex is or has been
intentionally attempting to circumvent copyright liability by funneling internet users to Perfect 10 images.

Perfect 10 also invokes the predicate act doctrine, “whereby a plaintiff can collect damages for foreign copyright
violations that are directly linked to the domestic copyright violation.” Minden, 2013 WL 71774 at *1, citing L.A. News Serv. v.
Reuters Television Int'l, Ltd.. 149 F.3d 987 , 991-92 (9th Cir.1998). Perfect 10's argument that a contributory infringement
could constitute a predicate violation still presupposes a territorial direct infringement to support contributory liability. For the
50,000 links at issue, no territorial direct infringement exists.

Perfect 10 further argues that the 40,000 yandex.com thumbnails that were stored in the United States for nine months
could constitute predicate direct infringements, notwithstanding Yandex's fair use defense. This theory of liability ends where
it starts. Because (as explained above) those yandex.com thumbnails constituted fair use, they did not infringe, and there is
no predicate violation.

3. Vicarious Liability Claim.
Amazon sets out the test for vicarious liability:

One infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it. As this


--- Page 7 ---
formulation indicates, to succeed in imposing vicarious liability, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant exercises the
requisite control over the direct infringer and that the defendant derives a direct financial benefit from the direct infringement.

508 F.3d at 1173 . Like contributory liability, vicarious liability requires an underlying act of direct infringement. Yandex's
websites in Russia do not directly infringe because they are beyond the territorial reach of the Copyright Act. Yandex's
thumbnails that were stored on servers in the United States for a nine-month period did not infringe because they were fair
use. This order has also determined that Yandex is not contributorily liable based on extraterritorial third-party infringement.
Thus, for these issues specifically within the scope of Yandex's motion for partial summary judgment, there can be no
vicarious liability. To this extent, Yandex's motion for summary judgment is Granted .

4. United States Downloads.
Finally, Perfect 10 contends that it has “demonstrated that the U.S. Copyright Act applies by presenting evidence of
[962 F.Supp.2d 1159]

downloads in the United States” (Opp. 17). It is not clear from Perfect 10's opposition whether it makes this argument in the
context of its allegations of direct infringement, contributory infringement, jurisdiction, or something else. Regardless, the
same result pertains. Whether the alleged infringing United States downloads are analyzed as a basis for direct or
contributory liability, at the summary judgment stage Perfect 10 must adduce evidence that such downloads occurred. It has
not done so.

Perfect 10 asserts that at “least 40 Perfect 10 images were likely uploaded to Yandex-hosted websites” (Dkt. No. 167 at
19 (emphasis added)). As explained above, it is not contested that the Yandex websites that host images are extraterritorial,
which precludes direct infringement for hosting the uploaded images.

Perfect 10 submitted declarations from a private investigator, a web developer, and a graphic designer (Dkt. Nos. 167—
28-30). In each one, the declarant states they were asked by Perfect 10 to use various Yandex services to download
Perfect 10 images to computers located within the United States. Each declarant confirms that this is “possible” and then
explains the process by which they each accomplished the task. These declarations do not change any of the conclusions
herein. Perfect 10's own downloads (and downloads by its agents) conducted as part of its investigation do not constitute
direct infringements because Perfect 10 cannot infringe its own copyrights. Nor do any of the declarations rise to the level of
expert testimony showing that any particular quantity of such downloads have in fact occurred. This order agrees that it is
possible for someone in the United States to download infringing copies of Perfect 10 images using Yandex's search
engine. The summary judgment record does not establish, however, that any such downloading has actually occurred.

In its opposition brief, Perfect 10 claims that “it is a foregone conclusion that U.S. users will download [copyrighted]
images” and “the enormous traffic to Yandex search engines statistically guarantees that downloads of Perfect 10 images ...
by U.S. users have taken place” ( ibid .). These claims are not supported by expert testimony, documents, or other
evidence. Thus, on the present record, they are speculative and unsubstantiated. In sum, Perfect 10's assertions regarding
United States downloads do not change any of the conclusions herein.

Conclusion

For the reasons stated above, Yandex's motion for partial summary judgment is Granted . This order disposes of
Perfect 10's direct infringement claims in their entirety. A portion of Perfect 10's claims for contributory and vicarious liability
remain in the case and shall proceed to trial.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

Notes:

There is a split in authority as to whether the extraterritoriality question is jurisdictional in nature, or should instead be
analyzed in terms of whether the extraterritorial acts state a claim for infringement._Litecubes, LLC v. Northern Light Prods.
Inc., 523 F.3d 1353 , 1867-68 (Fed.Cir.2008). Our court of appeals has not ruled on the issue, and it is only mentioned in a
footnote in the parties’ briefs. This order assumes without deciding that the issue should be analyzed in terms of whether the
extraterritorial acts state a claim.

2. Perfect 10 devotes a section of its opposition to arguing that Perfect 10 thumbnails on Yandex's fotki.yandex.ru
search engine are not fair use (Dkt. No. 167 at 13-14). This issue is outside the scope of Yandex's motion for partial
summary judgment. Moreover, the fotki.yandex.ru servers are extraterritorial and therefore not susceptible of a claim of
direct infringement.

3 Following the submission by Perfect 10 of evidence that 23 of the links connected to domestic websites, Yandex
withdrew its motion as to those 23 and now only seeks summary judgment on those links for which the extraterritorial situs is

TD BANK N.A.
v.
Vernon W. HILL, Il, Appellant

No. 16-2897
United States Court of Appeals, Third Circuit.

Argued: October 22, 2018
Opinion Filed: July 1, 2019

OPINION OF THE COURT
KRAUSE, Circuit Judge.
[928 F.3d 265

This case marks the latest chapter in the bitter feud between Commerce Bank, which has since merged with TD Bank, and
its former CEO, Vernon W. Hill, Il. See generally Hill v. TD Bank, NA , 586 F. App'x 874 (3d Cir. 2014) ; Commerce Bancorp,
LLC v. Hill, No. 08-cv-5628, 2010 WL 2545166 (D.N.J. June 18, 2010). Beset by acrimony, TD Bank filed this copyright
lawsuit against Hill, alleging that a portion of his 2012 book infringes a neglected manuscript that Hill co-authored while CEO
of Commerce Bank. In enjoining Hill from publishing or marketing his book, the District Court concluded that TD Bank owned
the copyright under a letter agreement and that Hill’s book irreparably violated the Bank’s ""right to not use the copyright.""
App. 9. In this denouement, we resolve certain open questions in our Circuit concerning employees’ rights to their artistic
creations and the proper exercise of equitable discretion.

We conclude that, although the agreement between the parties did not vest initial ownership of the copyright in the Bank by
purporting to designate the manuscript a work ""for hire,"" it did transfer any ownership interest Hill possessed to TD Bank. As
a result, Hill’s co-ownership defense, like his other defenses, fails. As for the imposition of injunctive relief, however, we
cannot accept the District Court's sweeping conclusions, which would justify the issuance of an injunction in every copyright
case. Instead of employing ""categorical rule[s]"" that would resolve the propriety of injunctive relief ""in a broad swath of
cases,"" courts should issue injunctive relief only if the moving party makes a sufficient showing that such relief is warranted
under the particular circumstances of that case. eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC , 547 U.S. 388 , 393-94, 126 S.Ct. 1837 ,
164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006) . Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court’s permanent injunction.

I. Background +
Described by American Banker as ""the closest thing that the staid banking industry
[928 F.3d 266]

has to a rock star,"" App. 1157, Vernon W. Hill, Il headed Commerce Bank from its launch as a single ""store"" in 1973 until
June 2007, a few months before TD Bank acquired it for approximately $8.5 billion. Hill built Commerce Bank in the highly
saturated commercial banking industry by emphasizing customer loyalty through initiatives such as extended hours, quick
account openings, and free perks at branches. His success also brought him personal acclaim, including articles in The Wall
Street Journal , American Banker , The Guardian , The Philadelphia Inquirer , and The Daily Telegraph .

As CEO of Commerce Bank, Hill reported to the Board of Directors and handled the day-to-day management of the Bank’s
affairs, including reviewing the Bank’s finances, visiting its stores, and handling real estate and insurance matters. Under his
employment agreement with Commerce Bank, Hill had ""primary responsibility for all operations of Commerce and its
subsidiaries ..., provided that such duties are consistent with his present duties,"" and agreed to ""devote his full time and best
efforts to the business and affairs of Commerce and its subsidiaries."" App. 803. Notwithstanding this commitment, however,
he Agreement allowed Hill to pursue ""outside activities,"" which the Agreement did not define. App. 803.

In 2006, Hill decided to write a book about his business philosophy and more than 30-year tenure at the Bank. Seeing this
as a marketing opportunity, Commerce Bank supported the endeavor by hiring a business book author, Robert Andelman,
0 collaborate with Hill in drafting the manuscript. Hill exchanged some emails about the project during weekdays but
primarily worked on the project during evenings and weekends. Other Commerce Bank employees sometimes assisted, for
example, by answering Andelman’s inquiries and providing feedback about the manuscript. The final manuscript, completed
in 2007, recounts Commerce Bank’s history and business model from Hill’s perspective. Resembling both an autobiography
and a marketing tool, the 2007 manuscript included both a personal dedication to Hill’s wife and ""the entire Commerce
eam,"" App. 834, and a $20 gift certificate to open an account at Commerce Bank.

Commerce Bank spearheaded the publication efforts by entering into an agreement with Portfolio, a division of Penguin
Books. In this publishing agreement, Commerce Bank, which is defined as the ""Author,"" represented and warranted that it
was the exclusive owner of all rights conveyed in the manuscript:

The Author [i.e., Commerce Bank] hereby represents and warrants ... that Vernon Hill is the sole author of the


--- Page 2 ---
Work; that the Work is or will be Vernon Hill’s next book length work ...; that the Author is the sole and exclusive
owner of all rights granted to the Publisher in this Agreement and has not assigned, pledged or otherwise
encumbered the same; ... that the Author has full power to enter into this Agreement and to make the grants
herein contained.

App. 1142. For his part, Vernon Hill signed a letter to Portfolio that referred to an attached copy of the publishing agreement
and provided:

| hereby unconditionally guarantee, promise and agree with the Publisher, its successors and assigns that the
Author [i.e., Commerce Bank] will, in all

[928 F.3d 267]

respects, faithfully perform and fulfill all obligations of the Agreement on its part to be performed and fulfilled at
the time and in the manner therein provided. | also unconditionally guarantee that the Work is a work made for
hire within the meaning of the United States Copyright Law and that the Author is the owner of copyright in the
Work and has full power and authority to enter into the Agreement.

App. 1139. Both this letter agreement and the publishing agreement contain New York choice-of-law provisions.

But the best laid schemes of mice and men often go awry: The relationship between Hill and Commerce Bank soured,
culminating in Hill’s termination and TD Bank’s acquisition of Commerce Bank. See Hill , 586 F. App'x at 877. As a result, the
2007 manuscript was never published, and by April 2008, Commerce Bank terminated the publishing agreement with
Portfolio.

As the years progressed, however, Hill sought to make use of certain portions of the manuscript. By July 2010, Hill had
debuted his next commercial banking venture, Metro Bank UK. The bank’s launch, the first in Great Britain for over a
century, garnered significant press coverage on both sides of the Atlantic. Capitalizing on this comeback, Hill co-authored
another book with Andelman—this one describing Hill’s experiences founding Metro Bank UK, the British banking system,
and Hill’s pet insurance company, Petplan USA. The book, entitled FANS! Not Customers: How to Create Growth
Companies in a No-Growth World , became available in November 2012 through online booksellers such as Amazon and
barnesandnoble.com. Hill also publicized the book’s launch through interviews, including with Jim Cramer, the host of Mad
Money on CNBC, and with a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer .

The plot thickened when this new endeavor came to the attention of TD Bank. Having shelved the 2007 manuscript for
years, the Bank suddenly registered it with the Copyright Office and sent take-down demands to twenty retailers alleging
that Hill's book infringed its copyright. Shortly thereafter, it filed suit in the District of New Jersey for copyright infringement.

As the litigation progressed, discovery revealed that TD Bank had little actually at stake: TD Bank admitted that, at most,
16% of the book infringed the 2007 manuscript, and that it has never published the 2007 manuscript or any competing work
and has no interest in doing so.

Nonetheless, in its summary judgment opinion, the District Court concluded that, because the letter agreement ""deem[ed]
he work to be a work made for hire,"" it was in fact a work for hire, vesting the copyright in the 2007 manuscript with
Commerce Bank as Hill’s employer. App. 35 n.10. Rejecting Hill’s infringement defenses, the District Court determined that
Hill had copied expressive content that was not unprotectable under the merger and scéne-a-faire doctrines. And Hill’s
copying, the District Court held, was not fair use because Hill did not repurpose the copied portion; the original manuscript
was unpublished; and Hill’s infringement would likely result in ""some impairment"" to the market for the 2007 manuscript
""should TD Bank ever choose to publish [it]."" App. 48 (emphasis omitted). But the District Court declined to issue an
injunction, explaining that TD Bank had failed to show a likelihood of continued infringement and had not addressed at all
he adequacy of legal remedies or the balance of hardships.

Hill faced his peripeteia in this litigation a year later. Confronted with evidence of Hill’s continued promotion of the 2012 book
and distribution of complimentary

928 F.3d 268]

copies at a local chamber of commerce event, the District Court enjoined Hill from ""publish[ing], market[ing], distribut[ing] or
sell[ing]"" the 2012 book. App. 4. This conduct, the District Court found, irreparably harmed TD Bank by depriving it of the
""right to not use the copyright."" App. 9. Hill timely appealed.

Il. Jurisdiction

There is no final judgment in this case because the District Court has stayed TD Bank’s request for infringer’s profits under
17 U.S.C. § 504(b) pending the outcome of this appeal. See Marshak v. Treadwell , 240 F.3d 184 , 190-92 (3d Cir. 2001) ;
28 U.S.C. § 1291. Thus, we have jurisdiction only over the District Court’s ""grant[ ]"" of a permanent injunction under 28
U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). 2 See Marshak. 240 F.3d at 190 . Before reaching the merits of Hill's appeal, we must first address TD
Bank’s contention that this appeal is moot and that we lack jurisdiction to consider the District Court’s summary judgment
ruling, even to the extent that it served as the necessary predicate for the permanent injunction. We reject both arguments.



--- Page 3 ---
A. Mootness

TD Bank first contends that this appeal is moot because Hill released a revised version of the book about a month after the
District Court issued the injunction and, as TD Bank posits in a footnote to its appellate brief, ""the July 7, 2016 Kindle version
[of Hill’s book] ... does not infringe on the 2007 manuscript."" 3 Appellee’s Br. 3 n.1.

Compliance with an injunction can moot an appeal if there is no ""reasonable expectation"" that the injunction will govern the
enjoined party’s future conduct or otherwise injure him._Bell v. Wolfish 441 U.S. 520 , 543 n.25, 99 S.Ct. 1861 , 60 L.Ed.2d
447 (1979) ; see Harris v. City of Philadelphia , 47 F.3d 1311 , 1326 (3d Cir. 1995) ; 13B Charles Alan Wright et al..Federal
Practice & Procedure § 3533.2.2 (3d ed. 2018). Yet TD Bank’s footnote conceding that the July 7, 2016 Kindle version does
not infringe the 2007 manuscript hardly constitutes the broad ""unconditional and irrevocable"" covenant not to sue that is
needed to moot a case. See Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc. , 568 U.S. 85 , 93, 133 S.Ct. 721 , 184 L.Ed.2d 553 (2013) (applying
the voluntary-cessation doctrine). Even if we accept the footnote as legally binding, it applies only to ""the July 7, 2016 Kindle
version."" Appellee’s Br. 3 n.1. In fact, at oral argument, TD Bank’s counsel refused to concede that any other version of the
revised book complied with the injunction, demanding twice that Hill first ""certiffy]"" that he will not publish, distribute, or
otherwise market the 2012 book (which sounds much like a consent decree). Third Cir. Arg. Recording at 57:48-58:06,
58:38-58:50. 4 The record also reflects that the Bank sent two letters asserting that the

[928 F.3d 269]

rewritten book may still contain copyrighted content; the latter letter threatened to bring contempt sanctions against Hill. Hill,
meanwhile, continues to profess his intention ""to share the earlier book."" Appellant's Reply Br. 3.

TD Bank’s other arguments on appeal are inconsistent with its assertion that this case is moot. For instance, the Bank urges
us not to vacate the permanent injunction if we conclude that this appeal is moot, see United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.
340 U.S. 36 , 39,71 S.Ct. 104 , 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950) , because doing so would ""permit the infringing 2012 Book to become
available."" Appellee’s Br. 3 n.3. That is to say, TD Bank does believe the injunction meaningfully constrains Hill’s future
conduct. And, in the same brief as its footnote concession, TD Bank accuses Hill of ""continu[ing] to infringe TD Bank’s
copyright in the 2007 Manuscript"" even "" afterthe entry of the PI order."" Appellee’s Br. 24 n.12. TD Bank’s motion to
supplement the record reiterates these allegations, citing material that supposedly ""evidences the District Court’s prescience
in finding that Mr. Hill was likely to continue infringing TD Bank’s copyright."" Appellee’s Mot. Suppl. R. at 8 (Apr. 25, 2018).

TD Bank cannot have it both ways: Hill cannot be both a continuing infringer and fully compliant with the permanent
injunction. As there is at least a reasonable likelihood that the injunction controls Hill’s future conduct, this appeal is not
moot. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 543 n.25, 99 S.Ct. 1861 .

B. Scope of the Appeal

TD Bank next contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of the non-appealable summary judgment
order—even to the extent that the permanent injunction order rests on its determination of ownership and liability—because
Hill did not separately identify the summary judgment order in his notice of appeal. We are unpersuaded.

Our interlocutory jurisdiction under § 1292(a)(1) encompasses matters ""inextricably linked"" with the issuance of a permanent
injunction. Marshak__240 F.3d at 190 ; Kershner v. Mazurkiewicz , 670 F.2d 440 , 449 (3d Cir. 1982) (en banc). Applying this
standard, we have previously reviewed summary judgment orders that made the determination of liability necessary for the
issuance of a permanent injunction. See, e.g. , Doeblers’ Pa. Hybrids, Inc. v. Doebler , 442 F.3d 812 , 819 (3d Cir. 2006) ;
Cureton v. NCAA , 198 F.3d 107 , 113 (3d Cir. 1999). Although we acquire jurisdiction only over orders specified or ""fairly
inferred"" in the notice of appeal, we construe such notices liberally. Wiest v. Lynch , 710 F.3d 121 , 127 (3d Cir. 2013)
(citation omitted). To that end, we have held that we may review an unspecified order if (1) it is connected to those specified
in the notice of appeal, (2) the intent to appeal the unspecified order is ""apparent,"" and (3) the appellee is not prejudiced. /d.
at 127 ; Polonski v. Trump Taj Mahal Assocs. , 137 F.3d 139 , 144 (3d Cir. 1998).

Hill did not separately identify the summary judgment order in his notice of appeal. Insofar as this was error, it is
understandable because Hill cannot directly appeal the summary judgment order under § 1292(a)(1). At a minimum, the
summary judgment order falls within those unspecified orders that we may consider on appeal. See Wiest._710 F.3d at 127 .
The summary judgment order established two fundamental prerequisites for issuing a copyright injunction—namely, TD
Bank’s ownership of the copyright and Hill’s liability for infringement. The District Court also made repeated references in its
permanent injunction opinion to its summary judgment decision, including incorporating

[928 F.3d 270]

by reference that order’s rendition of the undisputed facts. Nor can TD Bank seriously claim that the failure to specify the
summary judgment order prejudiced it, as the record is complete and the Bank had notice of—and fully briefed—the
ownership and liability issues.

Our conclusion is buttressed by the Second Circuit’s decision in Shakhnes v. Berlin , 689 F.3d 244 (2d Cir. 2012) , which
held that the appellate court had jurisdiction to review the district court's grant of partial summary judgment, even though it
was not specifically listed in the notice of appeal from a permanent injunction. /d. at 250 n.3. The summary judgment



--- Page 4 ---
decision, the Second Circuit stressed, was ""the principal legal basis"" for issuing the permanent injunction and ""[a]ny doubt""
should have been dispelled by the injunction opinion’s reference to the prior order. /d. We concur and conclude that our
jurisdiction extends to the District Court's summary judgment decision, inasmuch as that decision resolved ownership of the
copyright and Hill’s liability.

Ill. Discussion

We review the District Court’s grant of summary judgment de novo, Brownstein v. Lindsay , 742 F.3d 55 , 64 (3d Cir. 2014),
and its grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion, Doeblers’ Pa. Hybrids_. 442 F.3d at 819 . A district court
abuses its discretion if its decision rests on an incorrect legal standard, a clearly erroneous factual finding, or a
misapplication of the law to the facts. /d. We may affirm on any basis supported by the record, even if it departs from the
District Court's rationale. Erie Telecomms.. Inc. v. City of Erie _853 F.2d 1084 , 1089 & n.10 (3d Cir. 1988).

To prevail at summary judgment, TD Bank needed to establish that: (1) it possessed exclusive rights in the 2007
manuscript, and (2) Hill's 2012 book copied protected expression without privilege. Feist Publ’ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.

499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) . The Bank then needed to show that the District Court
should exercise its discretion to award permanent injunctive relief. eBay, 547 U.S. at 391 , 126 S.Ct. 1837 . We address
each requirement in turn. 5

A. Exclusive Rights in the 2007 Manuscript

TD Bank and Hill dispute whether the Bank exclusively owns the copyright in the 2007 manuscript. Hill claims that his
contributions to the work make him at least a joint author, in which case TD Bank could not sue him for copyright
infringement. See Brownstein v. Lindsay , 742 F.3d 55 , 68 (3d Cir. 2014) :Cortner v. Israel , 732 F.2d 267 , 271 (2d Cir.
1984). TD Bank does

[928 F.3d 271]

not dispute that Hill made an artistic contribution sufficient to secure authorial rights but contends that Commerce Bank
exclusively owned the work through the letter agreement that Hill signed or because it satisfied the traditional agency criteria
for determining whether a work falls within the scope of employment. Although the meaning of authorship has bedeviled
philosophers and writers for centuries, see, e.g. , Immanuel Kant, Critique of Judgment 174-88 (Werner S. Pluhar trans.,
1987) (1790), we can resolve it here based on the Copyright Act and controlling precedent. Hill's co-ownership defense
founders if: (1) the Copyright Act’s statute of limitations bars the defense, (2) TD Bank exclusively owns the manuscript
under the letter agreement, or (3) Hill created it within the scope of his employment under agency-law principles. We
consider these issues seriatim.

1. The Copyright Act's Three-Year Statute of Limitations Does Not Apply to Hill’s Co-Ownership Defense

Before addressing the merits of Hill’s co-ownership defense, we must address TD Bank’s argument that the Copyright Act’s
three-year statute of limitations prevents us from even considering it. Typically, a statute of limitations aims to ""keep stale
litigation out of the courts,"" not to bar the ""consideration of a particular defense"" in timely litigation. United States v. W. Pac.
R.R. Co. , 352 U.S. 59 , 72,77 S.Ct. 161 , 1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956) . Hence, the Copyright Act’s three-year statute of limitations
does not preclude a defendant in an infringement action from raising an ownership defense. & Pritchett v. Pound , 473 F.3d
217 , 220 (5th Cir. 2006) : Burne Hogarth v. Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. , 342 F.3d 149 , 163-64 (2d Cir. 2003) ; 3 Melville B.
Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 12.05 (2018) (hereinafter Nimmer on Copyright ) (observing that the
Copyright Act’s statute of limitations ""has no purchase when a plaintiff attempts to invoke [it] ... to defeat a defendant’s
position of being the pertinent author,"" because it operates only as a defense against claims or counterclaims). This rule
holds true even if the defendant also brings an untimely ownership counterclaim. Burne Hogarth__342 F.3d at 164 . Thus,
irrespective of whether Hill’s co-ownership counterclaim is time-barred (a question we lack jurisdiction to reach), the
Copyright Act’s statute of limitations does not prevent Hill from raising co-ownership as a defense to TD Bank’s infringement
lawsuit.

2. The Letter Agreement Granted TD Bank Exclusive Ownership of the 2007 Manuscript

The District Court correctly determined that TD Bank exclusively owns the rights to the 2007 manuscript under the letter
agreement, but it did so based on a mistaken belief that the letter agreement vested original ownership in the Bank by
""deemling]"" the work to be a work ""for hire."" App. 35 n.10. To explain why we nonetheless affirm, we must tease out the
distinction between the work-for-hire and assignment doctrines, explaining how those doctrines relate to the terms of the
agreement here.

Work-for-Hire Doctrine. The 1976 Copyright Act’s definition of a ""work made for hire"" reflects a ""carefully worked out
compromise"" between the artistic guilds,

[928 F.3d 272]

whose members disfavored the work-for-hire doctrine because of their lesser bargaining power, and the major publishers,
studios, and record labels, which supported a broader work-for-hire doctrine to facilitate the acquisition of rights. Cmty. for


--- Page 5 ---
Creative Non-Violence (""CCNV"") v. Reid__490 U.S. 730 , 745-48 & nn.11-14, 109 S.Ct. 2166 , 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989)
(citation omitted). The Act defines a work for hire as either (1) a work created by an employee within the scope of his
employment, or (2) a ""specially ordered or commissioned"" work if it falls within nine enumerated categories of works and the
parties agree in writing to designate it as a work for hire. 17 U.S.C. § 101. The definition thus establishes ""two mutually
exclusive means"" by which a work can attain for-hire status: the first for employees, and the second for independent
contractors. CCNV. 490 U.S. at 742 —43, 109 S.Ct. 2166.

The 2007 manuscript does not meet the second definition because Hill did not serve as an independent contractor and the
manuscript does not fall within any of the nine enumerated categories of works. Accordingly, the manuscript could only
receive work-for-hire treatment if it satisfied the first definition—that is, if Hill, while an employee of TD Bank, created it within
the scope of his employment. To determine whether a work falls within the scope of employment, courts should apply
general principles of agency law. /d. at 738, 740-41, 109 S.Ct. 2166 .

In its summary judgment decision, the District Court recited these principles correctly but nonetheless accepted TD Bank’s
argument that the letter agreement itself vested exclusive ownership with the Bank, stating that ""[I]language in a written
instrument ... that deems the work to be a work made for hire within the meaning of the Copyright Act may ... vest ownership
exclusively with an employer."" App. 35 n.10.

That was error. It appears the District Court confused an original vesting of ownership under the work-for-hire doctrine with a
transfer of ownership rights via an assignment. By its terms, the Copyright Act recognizes only nine specified categories of
works by independent contractors that can be deemed ""for hire"" through a signed writing. 17 U.S.C. § 101(2). For an
employee's work to receive for-hire treatment, by contrast, the work must actually come within the ""scope of his or her
employment."" /d. § 101(1). Certain writings, such as negotiated employment agreements, may sometimes help clarify the
scope of employment, when considered under general agency-law principles. See U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc. v. Parts
Geek, LLC , 692 F.3d 1009 , 1018 (9th Cir. 2012) ; but cf. Garcetti v. Ceballos , 547 U.S. 410 , 424-25, 126 S.Ct. 1951 , 164
L.Ed.2d 689 (2006) (observing that ""[flormal job descriptions often bear little resemblance"" to an employee's actual duties,
and the mere inclusion of a task in a job description ""is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting the
ask is within the scope of the employee’s professional duties""). But a bare statement that a particular work is ""for hire,"" says
nothing about the scope of an individual's employment and cannot suffice on its own. Had Congress intended to permit
parties to ""deem"" works by employees as ""for hire,"" it would have so specified in subsection 101(1), just as it did for
independent contractors in subsection 101(2). /d. But it did not. And where, as here, ""Congress has shown that it knows how
‘0 [adopt a measure] in express terms,"" it is ""particularly inappropriate"" to extend that policy to another subsection lacking
such language.

928 F.3d 273

Kimbrough v. United States , 552 U.S. 85 , 103, 128 S.Ct. 558 , 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) ; Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co. , 534
U.S. 438 , 452,122 S.Ct. 941 , 151 L.Ed.2d 908 (2002) .

Whether a writing operates to render a work ""for hire"" or to assign the author's interest may seem like a distinction without a
difference. But that distinction, though technical, does carry some practical consequences. If a work qualifies as a work for
hire, the Act treats the employer or principal as the author, and the copyright presumptively vests in the principal unless the
parties execute an agreement to the contrary. 17 U.S.C. § 201(b). If a work does not satisfy the statutory definition, the
author can still assign it but retains certain non-waivable rights to cancel the transfer after 35-40 years, id. § 203(a)(3), and
—depending on the type of work—waivable moral rights in the work’s proper attribution and integrity, id. § 106A(a). The
creator of a work for hire has neither, see id. §§ 101, 106A(a), 203(a), so allowing parties to deem a work as ""for hire""
without fulfilling the statutory requirements would undercut the Copyright Act’s protection of those termination and moral
rights and would negate the difference between a work for hire and an assigned work. 2 That difference underscores why an
employee’s work created outside the scope of employment cannot simply be ""deem[ed]"" for hire.

Our view accords with those of leading copyright scholars and other Courts of Appeals. The Nimmer treatise, for instance,
observes that ""an agreement ... whereby works prepared by the employee that are not prepared within the scope of
employment are nevertheless deemed to be ‘works made for hire’ will not in itself convert such works into the ‘for hire’
category."" 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 5.03[B][1][b][ii]; accord Goldstein on Copyright § 4.3 (3d ed. 2018) (noting that, unless
the work satisfies the ""objective"" criteria of the work-for-hire doctrine, ""A’s express agreement that the work prepared by A
will constitute a work made for hire by B will not suffice to make the work one for hire, nor to make B the author""); F. Jay
Dougherty, Not A Spike Lee Joint? Issues in the Authorship of Motion Pictures Under U.S. Copyright Law , 49 UCLA L. Rev.
225, 317-18 (2001) (""Parties cannot simply agree that works not within the scope of employment are works made for hire
with the employer deemed the author.""). Our sister circuits likewise agree that, although parties to an employment
relationship can agree to alter the statutory presumption that a work-for-hire copyright vests with the employer, they cannot
by contract ""vary the work’s status as a work made for hire."" Baltimore Orioles, Inc. v. Major League Baseball Players Ass'n,
805 F.2d 663 , 670 (7th Cir. 1986) (citing M. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 5.03[D] (1985)); see Saenger Org.. Inc. v.
Nationwide Ins. Licensing Assocs., Inc. , 119 F.3d 55 , 62 (1st Cir. 1997) ; Marvel Characters, Inc. v. Simon , 310 F.3d 280 ,
291 (2d Cir. 2002).

For these reasons, the District Court was mistaken in concluding that the letter agreement vested ownership in the Bank by
deeming the manuscript a work for hire. But although it affixed the wrong label, the Court’s determination of ownership was


--- Page 6 ---
correct because the agreement operated as an assignment—the issue to which we now turn.
Assignment. The validity and import of an assignment generally is governed by state contract law. See

[928 F.3d 274]

Roger Miller Music, Inc. v. Sony/ATV Publ’g, LLC__ 477 F.3d 383 , 392 (6th Cir. 2007) :Walthal v. Rusk, 172 F.3d 481 , 485
(7th Cir. 1999). The Copyright Act merely adds that an assignment must be memorialized by an ""instrument of conveyance,
or a note or memorandum of the transfer, ... in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner's duly
authorized agent."" 17 U.S.C. § 204(a) ; see Barefoot Architect, Inc. v. Bunge , 632 F.3d 822 , 827 (3d Cir. 2011).

Here, the parties agree that New York law applies under the letter agreement’s choice-of-law clause. Under that state’s law,
courts construe assignments using the ""same rules which obtain in the interpretation of other contracts,"" Crook v. Rindskopf
. 105 N.Y. 476 , 12 N.E. 174 , 177 (1887), which include giving effect to the parties’ intent as principally expressed through
the words of the agreement itself,_Greenfield v. Philles Records, Inc. , 98 N.Y.2d 562 , 750 N.Y.S.2d 565 , 780 N.E.2d 166 ,
170 (2002). Resort to extrinsic evidence is permitted only if ambiguity exists within the four corners of the agreement.Brad
H. v. City of New York , 17 N.Y.3d 180 , 928 N.Y.S.2d 221 , 951 N.E.2d 743 , 746 (2011). If it does not, a court should
construe the agreement to ""carry out the plain purpose and object"" of the contract and to give effect to the parties’ ""over-all
intention.""_Kass v. Kass , 91 N.Y.2d 554 , 673 N.Y.S.2d 350 , 696 N.E.2d 174 , 181 (1998) (citation omitted). The agreement
need not comply with any formalities or invoke particular language to constitute an assignment; any writing will suffice as
long as ""the assignor has, in some fashion, manifested an intention to make a present transfer of his rights to the assignee.""
Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co. v. Romano . 147 A.D.3d 1021 1023, 48 N.Y.S.3d 237 (N.Y. App. Div. 2007) (citation and
emphasis omitted); Whalen v. Gerzof, 206 A.D.2d 688 , 690,615 N.Y.S.2d 465 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994) .

The letter agreement evinces that intention in both of its principal covenants. In the first, Hill acknowledged the publishing
agreement, a copy of which was attached to the letter, and ""guarantee[d], promise[d] and agree[d] with the Publisher ... that
he Author [i.e., Commerce Bank] will, in all respects, faithfully perform and fulfill all obligations of the Agreement."" App.
1139. That publishing agreement provided that ""the Author [i.e., Commerce Bank] is the sole and exclusive owner of all
rights granted to the Publisher in this Agreement and has not assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered the same; ... that
he Author has full power to enter into this Agreement and to make the grants herein contained."" App. 1142. In the second
covenant, Hill ""unconditionally guarantee[d] that the Work is a work made for hire within the meaning of the United States
Copyright Law and that the Author is the owner of copyright in the Work and has full power and authority to enter into the
Agreement."" App. 1139.

Hill makes much of the letter’s use of the word ""guarantee,"" for a guarantee typically describes an agreement to pay a
principal obligor’s debt upon that party’s default; the guarantor does not become a party to the underlying agreement and
assumes only secondary liability. Midland Stee! Warehouse Corp. v. Godinger Silver Art Ltd. , 276 A.D.2d 341 , 343,714
N.Y.S.2d 466 (N.Y. App. Div. 2000) . But the mere use of the word ""guarantee"" in a contract ""does not necessarily establish
he nature of the obligation,"" because the term, when read in context, may not establish a guarantor-guarantee relationship.
Brewster Transit Mix Corp. v. McLean , 169 A.D.2d 1036 1037, 565 N.Y.S.2d 316 (N.Y. App. Div. 1991) . In Brewster , for
example, the New York Appellate Division

928 F.3d 275]

concluded that a defendant assumed primary liability under an agreement providing that the party, both individually and as
an officer of a corporation, ""guarantee[d] to pay within the established terms for all purchases charged to my account."" /d. at
1036, 565 N.Y.S.2d 316 . Although the agreement used the word ""guarantee,"" the court concluded that it in fact reflected the
defendant’s assumption of primary liability as a co-obligor. /d. at 1037, 565 N.Y.S.2d 316 ; see also New York Plumber's
Specialties Co. v. 91 E. End Corp. , 42 N.Y.2d 865, 397 N.Y.S.2d 778 , 366 N.E.2d 866 , 867 (1977) (concluding that an
agreement under which the ""undersigned ... guarantee[d] the full and prompt payment to you, of all indebtedness due to
you"" was not a guarantee despite the use of that term).

Read as a whole, the terms of the letter agreement do not manifest an intent to assume secondary liability. Although Hill's
commitment ""guarantee[ing], promis[ing] and agree[ing]"" that Commerce Bank would fulfill its obligations could by itself
suggest a guarantee, Hill separately ""guarantee[d]"" that the manuscript ""is a work made for hire,"" that Commerce Bank ""is
the owner of copyright,"" and that the Bank ""has full power to enter into"" the publishing agreement. App. 1139. Nothing in
these latter provisions resembles a true guarantee, as Hill assumed these obligations without reference to any other
agreement or any other party’s obligations.

Instead, Hill's commitments together convey an unmistakable intent to effect a present transfer of any interest he possessed
in the manuscript. Hill's assurance that the manuscript ""is a work made for hire,"" App. 1139, though insufficient to actually
render it for hire, denotes an intent to relinquish his interest in the copyright. See 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 5.03[B][1][b][ii].
The use of the definite article ""the"" in ""[Commerce Bank] is the owner of copyright"" also implies that Commerce Bank is the
sole owner of the copyright. App. 1139; see, e.g. , Edgenet, Inc. v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc.__658 F.3d 662 , 666 (7th Cir.
2011). And this implication gains force in the second half of that sentence, which provides that Commerce Bank has ""full
power"" to execute the publishing agreement, because a co-owner lacks the authority to grant a truly exclusive license
without the consent of all co-owners. Brownstein__742 F.3d at 68 ; see Davis v. Blige . 505 F.3d 90 , 101 (2d Cir. 2007).



--- Page 7 ---
Finally, any lingering doubt is dispelled by the letter’s reference to the publishing agreement, which states that Commerce
Bank ""is the sole and exclusive owner of all rights granted to the Publisher in this Agreement."" App. 1142 (emphasis
added).

We recognize that courts do not lightly infer that a party has assigned his interest in a copyright, particularly given the
Copyright Act’s writing requirement, and in doubtful cases, a document should not be construed to divest an author
completely of his ownership interest. See Baisden v. I’m Ready Prods., Inc.__693 F.3d 491 , 500 (5th Cir. 2012) (endorsed
check for royalties did not constitute an assignment); Radio Television Espanola S.A. v. New World Entm'’t, Ltd._, 183 F.3d
922 , 927 (9th Cir. 1999) (fax referencing a deal without any indication of its terms and another discussing contract
negotiations did not satisfy the writing requirement); Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Dumas , 53 F.3d 549 , 564 (2d Cir. 1995)
(accepting, as

[928 F.3d 276]

not clearly erroneous, the district court’s finding that a stamp on an endorsed check ""assign[ing] ... all right, title and interest""
without mentioning ""copyright"" constituted an assignment of only the physical copy of a painting). We do not decide whether
any of Hill's commitments standing alone, including the failed attempt to deem the work for hire, would suffice to effect an
assignment. When considered as a whole, however, the letter agreement satisfies the requirements of an assignment under
both the Copyright Act and New York law, and we will affirm the District Court's ownership determination on this basis. 2

3. Whether the Manuscript Fell Within the Scope of Hill’s Employment

Although the letter agreement constitutes a valid assignment, the question remains whether the 2007 manuscript fell within
he scope of Hill’s employment. If it did, the work would receive for-hire treatment and Hill would lack any right to terminate

he assignment. See 17 U.S.C. § 203.

This Court has not had occasion to expound on when a work falls within the scope of employment. CCNV, however, held
hat the terms ""employee"" and ""scope of employment"" should be construed in light of general principles of agency law, citing
section 228 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency. 490 U.S. at 740 , 109 S.Ct. 2166 . Taking their cue from CCNV, other
Courts of Appeals have concluded that a work falls within the scope of employment only if ""[1] it is of the kind he is employed
0 perform; [2] it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits;

928 F.3d 277]

and [3] it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the [employer].’"" Avtec Sys., Inc. v. Peiffer, 21 F.3d 568 , 571
(4th Cir. 1994) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency § 228 (1958) ) (internal alterations omitted); see U.S. Auto Parts
Network_, 692 F.3d at 1015 ; Shaul v. Cherry Valley-Springfield Cent. Sch. Dist. , 363 F.3d 177 , 186 (2d Cir. 2004).

We agree with our sister circuits that CCNV counsels in favor of adopting the Second Restatement’s test. The second factor,
however, deserves further explication: Although the test is phrased in the conjunctive, meaning that all three factors must be
satisfied for a work to receive for-hire treatment, courts must consider time and spatial bounds with care. This factor is most
probative for employees who work shifts or otherwise have regular hours and definite workplaces. See, e.g. , City of Newark
v. Beasley , 883 F. Supp. 3 , 6, 8-9 (D.N.J. 1995) (law enforcement training course developed by a police officer while ""off
duty"" fell outside the time and spatial boundaries of his employment). In our increasingly mobile work culture, however,
many executives and professionals—for better or worse—lack obvious temporal or spatial boundaries for their work. See
Restatement (Third) of Agency § 7.07 cmt. b (2006) (explaining that the Third Restatement abandoned this factor because it
""does not naturally encompass the working circumstances of many managerial and professional employees""). For such
employees, the second factor will illuminate little, and a fact-finder cannot indulge in the fiction of a 9-to-5 workday. On the
other hand, even when an employee’s position has ascertainable temporal and spatial boundaries, her unilateral decision to
continue working at home or beyond normal hours has little bearing if a copyrighted work is clearly ""of the kind"" that the
employee was hired to create. Avtec Sys._. 21 F.3d at 571 ; U.S. Auto Parts Network 692 F.3d at 1018 ; 1 Nimmer on

Copyright § 5.03[B][1][b] fi).

Unfortunately, we are without the benefit of an opinion below applying the scope-of-employment test because the District
Court considered only the effect of the letter agreement. App. 35 n.10. In a similar circumstance, after clarifying the agency-
law principles that the district court should apply, the Fourth Circuit remanded the case, concluding that it was ""not in a
position to resolve that heavily fact-laden issue in the first instance."" Avtec Sys.__21 F.3d at 573 . We will follow the same
course here, as the issue is close and may require the trier of fact to resolve underlying factual disputes. Cf. MacLean
Assocs., Inc. v. Wm. M. Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen, Inc. , 952 F.2d 769 , 778 (3d Cir. 1991). Of course, Hill may choose to
forgo this inquiry, but it is not academic because it would determine whether Hill or his successors may eventually terminate
the assignment. See 17 U.S.C. § 203. We thus will leave it to the parties on remand to decide if they wish to open yet
another chapter in this litigation.

B. Liability for Infringement

Having concluded that TD Bank owned the exclusive rights in the manuscript, we briefly address Hill’s defenses to
infringement. Hill devotes a few sentences to the merger and scenes a faire doctrines, as well as the fair-use defense. The


--- Page 8 ---
District Court correctly granted summary judgment to TD Bank on these defenses.

The merger doctrine prohibits the copyrighting of expression ""when ‘there are no or few other ways of expressing a
particular idea.’ "" Educ. Testing Servs. v. Katzman , 793 F.2d 533 , 539 (3d Cir. 1986) (quotingApple Computer. Inc. v.
Franklin Computer Corp. , 714 F.2d 1240 , 1253 (3d Cir. 1983) ). A variation on

[928 F.3d 278]

the merger doctrine, the scenes a faire doctrine leaves unprotected ""incidents, characters or settings which are as a
practical matter indispensable in the treatment of a given topic."" Whelan Assocs., Inc. v. Jaslow Dental Lab., Inc. 797 F.2d
1222 , 1236 (3d Cir. 1986) (citation and internal alteration omitted). Hill could express his life story and business philosophy
in numerous ways, so the District Court properly concluded that the copied portions of the prior work were copyrightable.

As for fair use, the 2012 book was not transformative—i.e., it did not imbue the prior work with ""new expression, meaning, or
message""—so the permissible scope of fair use is more circumscribed. See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S.
569 , 579,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) . Given this, as well as Hill’s commercial sales of the 2012 work, the
unpublished nature of the 2007 manuscript, and the potential harm to the market for the original manuscript if TD Bank ever

elected to publish it, the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to TD Bank on Hill’s fair-use defense. See
Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. 471 U.S. 539 , 562, 563, 566-68, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) .

C. Propriety of the Injunction

Finally, we turn to the propriety of the District Court’s permanent injunction banning the ""publish[ing], market[ing],
distribut[ing] or sell[ing]"" of Hill's 2012 book. App. 4. As a matter entrusted to a court’s equitable discretion, an injunction
""does not follow from success on the merits as a matter of course."" Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7 , 32,
129 S.Ct. 365 , 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008) . Instead, even after prevailing on the merits, the party seeking a permanent
injunction must make a sufficient showing that (1) it will suffer irreparable injury, (2) no remedy available at law could
adequately remedy that injury, (3) the balance of hardships tips in its favor, and (4) an injunction would not disserve the
public interest. eBay, 547 U.S. at 391 , 126 S.Ct. 1837 . While we consider these factors holistically, the inability to show
irreparable harm—or, relatedly, that a legal remedy would be inadequate—defeats a request for injunctive relief. See Reilly
v. City of Harrisburg , 858 F.3d 173 , 179 (3d Cir. 2017).

Before eBay, this Circuit, like many others, applied a presumption of irreparable harm as long as a copyright plaintiff
established a prima facie case or reasonable likelihood of success. See Video Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista Home Entm't,
Inc._ 342 F.3d 191 , 206 (3d Cir. 2003) :Marco v. Accent Pub. Co. , 969 F.2d 1547 , 1553 (3d Cir. 1992) ; Educ. Testing
Servs.__793 F.2d at 543 ; Apple Comput.__714 F.2d at 1254 . That presumption would go a long way toward supporting the
District Court’s remedy here. But we have cause to reconsider it in light of the Supreme Court’s intervening guidance.

In eBay , the Supreme Court rejected the Federal Circuit's longstanding rule requiring, absent ""exceptional"" or ""unusual""
circumstances, the imposition of a permanent injunction after a finding of patent infringement. 547 U.S. at 393 -94, 126
S.Ct. 1837 (citation omitted). eBay held that the Federal Circuit’s rule conflated rights with remedies by relying on the Patent
Act's statutory ""right to exclude"" to create such a presumption. /d. at 392, 126 S.Ct. 1837 . Rather, absent express
Congressional guidance to the contrary, district courts retain discretion in resolving requests for injunctive relief, and ""such
discretion must be exercised consistent with traditional principles of equity, in patent disputes no less than in other cases.""

[928 F.3d 279]

Id. at 394, 126 S.Ct. 1837 . In so holding, eBay drew parallels to copyright law, where it had ""consistently rejected""
arguments that a permanent injunction should necessarily result from a finding of infringement. /d. at 392-93, 126 S.Ct.
1837 . It pointed, for example, toDun v. Lumbermen’s Credit Association__209 U.S. 20 , 28 S.Ct. 335 , 52 L.Ed. 663 (1908) ,
where the Court had affirmed a denial of an injunction for infringement of a reference book, agreeing with the lower courts
that the infringing content was ""so insignificant compared with the injury from stopping [the defendant's] use of their
enormous volume."" /d. at 23, 28 S.Ct. 335 . And it cited New York Times Co. v. Tasini , 533 U.S. 483 , 121 S.Ct. 2381 , 150
L.Ed.2d 500 (2001) , where, after concluding that newspapers exceeded their licenses by republishing freelance journalists’
articles in electronic databases, the Court cautioned that ""it hardly follows"" that an injunction should issue to remedy the
infringement. /d. at 505, 121 S.Ct. 2381 ; see Campbell__510 U.S. at 578 n.10, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (observing that copyright’s
goals ""are not always best served by automatically granting injunctive relief""); Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios.
Inc. . 464 U.S. 417 , 499, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (doubting that ""a broad
injunction"" should issue even if contributory liability attached).

Although eBay concerned the Patent Act, we have found its logic more widely applicable._Ferring Pharms., Inc. v. Watson
Pharms, Inc. , 765 F.3d 205 , 215 (3d Cir. 2014). Thus, inFerring , we abandoned our presumption of irreparable harm in
Lanham Act cases as inconsistent with eBay ’s admonition that courts may not fashion categorical rules or sweeping
principles that would undermine the traditional four-factor test. /d. at 213 & n.7, 216. Instead, we held that an injunction may
issue only if the plaintiff proves all four factors without the aid of any shortcuts. /d. at 216.



--- Page 9 ---
We have not reconsidered the presumption in copyright cases in particular since eBay , but several of our sister circuits
have, and they have rejected it. See, e.g. , CoxCom, Inc. v. Chaffee , 536 F.3d 101 , 111-12 (1st Cir. 2008) ; Salinger v.
Colting . 607 F.3d 68 , 77—78 (2d Cir. 2010) ; Christopher Phelps & Assocs., LLC v. Galloway , 492 F.3d 532 , 543 (4th Cir.
2007) ;_Flava Works, Inc. v. Gunter , 689 F.3d 754 , 755 (7th Cir. 2012) Flexible Lifeline Sys.. Inc. v. Precision Lift, Inc. . 654
F.3d 989 , 995-96 (9th Cir. 2011) ; Peter Letterese and Assocs., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enters. , 533 F.3d 1287 ,
1323 (11th Cir. 2008). Notably, Ferring relied on one of these decisions, Salinger v. Colting . 607 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 2010) ,
which jettisoned the presumption of irreparable harm in copyright cases because eBay ""strongly indicates"" that the principles
it reaffirmed should be ""the presumptive standard for injunctions in any context"" and eBay relied on the Court’s copyright
jurisprudence. 607 F.3d at 78 .

Based on Ferring and this persuasive authority, we hold today that eBay abrogates our presumption of irreparable harm in
copyright cases. The Copyright Act does not direct courts to depart from traditional principles of equity in adjudicating
requests for injunctive relief, see 17 U.S.C. § 502(a), and eBay’s reliance on the Court’s copyright decisions makes its
applicability even clearer here than in Ferring . Accordingly, a court considering the propriety of a copyright injunction should
no longer place a ""thumb on the scales"" in favor of injunctive relief and inquire merely whether ""there is good reason why an
injunction should notissue.""

[928 F.3d 280]

Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms , 561 U.S. 139 , 157-58, 130 S.Ct. 2743 , 177 L.Ed.2d 461 (2010) . Nor can the
four-factor test be faithfully applied through a ""perfunctory recognition that ‘an injunction does not automatically issue,’ "" id. at
157-58, 130 S.Ct. 2743 (citation omitted), or the factors’ rote invocation, see Winter_555 U.S. at 26 —-27, 129 S.Ct. 365 .
Irreparable harm in copyright cases ""must be prove[n], not presumed."" Flexible Lifeline Sys._, 654 F.3d at 1000 (quoting 4
Nimmer on Copyright § 14.06[A][5] ).

With these principles in mind, we consider whether the District Court abused its discretion in issuing this injunction.

1. Irreparable Injury

To obtain a permanent injunction, a moving party must show that it will suffer irreparable harm that is causally attributable to
the challenged infringement. See Perfect 10, Inc. v. Google, Inc. _653 F.3d 976 , 982 (9th Cir. 2011) :Apple Inc. v. Samsung
Elecs. Co. , 735 F.3d 1352 , 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (Patent Act). Even though TD Bank does not sell, license, or even use the
infringed work and has no intention of ever doing so, it persuaded the District Court that Hill's supposed continuing
infringement irreparably harmed the Bank by depriving it of the ""right to not use the copyright."" App. 9. We disagree. Neither
the prospect of continued infringement nor the ""right to not use"" a copyright establish irreparable harm.

At the outset, we can easily dismiss TD Bank’s contention that continued copyright infringement necessarily constitutes
irreparable harm. While a ""substantial likelinood"" of continuing infringement is necessary to obtain permanent injunctive
relief, Jane Doe No. 1 v. Backpage.com, LLC_, 817 F.3d 12 , 29 (1st Cir. 2016) ;see Ferring_., 765 F.3d at 219 , the
continuing nature of the infringement does not mean that any future injury would be irreparable, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. 518 F. Supp. 2d 1197 , 1215 (C.D. Cal. 2007) ;see Nichia Corp. v. Everlight Americas, Inc.
855 F.3d 1328 , 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (affirming a district court’s conclusion that a patentee failed to show that the
defendants’ ""continuing infringement ... has caused, and will continue to cause, irreparable harm""). Indeed, the Federal
Circuit has recognized that, after eBay , irreparable harm can no longer be presumed based on continued infringement and a
likelihood of success on the merits. See Robert Bosch LLC v. Pylon Mfg. Corp. , 659 F.3d 1142 , 1149 (Fed. Cir. 2011) ;see
also Reebok Int'l Ltd. v. J. Baker, Inc. , 32 F.3d 1552 , 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (presuming irreparable harm beforeeBay upon
a ""strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits coupled with continuing infringement’). If continued infringement
does not justify a presumption of irreparable harm, a fortiori it does not inherently give rise to irreparable harm. Instead, the
prospect that infringement will continue merely precipitates the question whether any future infringement would irreparably
injure the copyright owner.

The District Court’s reliance on ""the right to not use the copyright"" fares no better. See App. 9. Such a right is little more than
a rephrasing of the right to exclude, which eBay held did not justify a presumption of irreparable harm. See547 U.S. at 392 —
93, 126 S.Ct. 1837 . Even when this Court presumed irreparable harm, we required ""a stronger showing of irreparable harm""
if the infringed copyright was ""peripheral to the copyright holder’s business."" Video Pipeline. 342 F.3d at 206 (citation and
internal alterations omitted). Holding that a violation of ""the right to not use the copyright"" necessarily amounts to irreparable
harm would not only resurrect the presumption of irreparable harm, but make it irrebuttable, even where, as here,

[928 F.3d 281]

the infringement bears only a tangential relation to the copyright holder’s business. Cf. High Tech Med. Instrumentation, Inc.
v. New Image Indus., Inc. , 49 F.3d 1551 , 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (reversing the issuance of a preliminary injunction where
the patentee did ""not make or sell [the relevant products] and [did] not license their manufacture and sale"").

Our position that a violation of ""the right to not use [a] copyright"" does not inherently establish irreparable harm finds further


--- Page 10 ---
support in the Ninth Circuit's en banc decision in Garcia v. Google. Inc. . 786 F.3d 733 (9th Cir. 2015) . There, an actor who
allegedly was duped into making a five-second performance for the anti-Muslim movie /nnocence of Muslims sought an
injunction to remove the movie from YouTube because its release resulted in a fatwa against her and threats against her
family. Id. at 737-39. The en banc court noted that the actor’s alleged harms, though disturbing, bore little relation to any
interest protected by copyright law. /d. at 745. Copyright law grants authors exclusive rights in their expressive works to
incentivize ""the creation and publication of free expression""—not to protect an author’s privacy or reputation. /d. at 744-45
(quoting_E/dred v. Ashcroft , 537 U.S. 186 , 219,123 S.Ct. 769 , 154 L.Ed.2d 683 (2003) ). In seeking to remove the work (or
at least her five-second performance) from YouTube, the Ninth Circuit concluded, the actor had not demonstrated any harm,
much less irreparable harm, cognizable in copyright. 12 /d. at 746. We express no opinion on the Ninth Circuit’s ultimate
holding, but its premise is one on which we agree: A bare violation of a statutory right enshrined in the Copyright Act does
not establish irreparable harm.

In holding otherwise, the District Court relied on the Second Circuit's decision in Salinger , which mused that ""a copyright
holder might ... have a First Amendment interest in not speaking"" and later asserted that "" ‘[t]he loss of First Amendment
freedoms,’ and hence infringement of the right not to speak, ‘for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes
irreparable injury.’ "" 607 F.3d at 81 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). We do not view the Second Circuit as holding that
copyright infringement amounts to compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment. For one, Salinger vacated the
district court's grant of a preliminary injunction and stressed that irreparable harm must be proven. /d. at 82, 84. Equating
copyright infringement with compelled speech would justify an injunction whenever, as in Salinger , an author chooses not to
distribute a work. In addition, Salinger reiterated that copyright law aims to protect ""the commercial interest of the
artist/author"" and ""not to coddle artistic vanity or to protect secrecy."" /d. at 81 n.9 (emphasis omitted) (quoting New Era
Publ’ns Int'l, ApS v. Henry Holt & Co._.695 F. Supp. 1493 , 1526 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (Leval, J.)). Yet secrecy is exactly what
would be protected if the unauthorized distribution of a work were deemed an irreparable violation of the original author’s
right not to speak. 11

[928 F.3d 282]

For these reasons, the District Court should not have relied on Hill’s violation of the ""right to not use [a] copyright"" alone to
establish irreparable harm, App. 9, and because it did, it abused its discretion. See Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt.
Sys., Inc. , 572 U.S. 559 , 563 n.2, 134 S.Ct. 1744 , 188 L.Ed.2d 829 (2014) .

2. Adequate Remedy at Law

Although eBay identified irreparable harm and the adequacy of legal remedies as separate considerations, they typically
constitute two sides of the same inquiry, for the ""availability of adequate monetary damages belies a claim of irreparable
injury.""Bennington Foods LLC v. St. Croix Renaissance, Grp., LLP , 528 F.3d 176 , 179 (3d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted);see
Samuel L. Bray, The Supreme Court and the New Equity , 68 Vand. L. Rev. 997, 1026-27, 1048 (2015) (""[T]hese
formulations are customarily interchangeable.""). Below, the District Court concluded that, because Hill was distributing the
2012 book for free, TD Bank’s injury ""is ... not easily quantifiable or compensable at law."" App. 10. This, too, was error.

Under the Copyright Act, a copyright holder may recover either actual damages and the infringer’s profits or statutory
damages. 17 U.S.C. § 504(a). Other circuits have interpreted the Act’s allowance of ""actual damages"" to permit reasonable
royalty damages. See, e.g. ,On Davis v. The Gap, Inc. . 246 F.3d 152 , 163-72 (2d Cir. 2001) :Dash v. Mayweather , 731
F.3d 303 , 312 (4th Cir. 2013) ; MGE UPS Sys., Inc. v. GE Consumer & Indus., Inc_, 622 F.3d 361 , 366 (5th Cir. 2010). Asa
condition of denying a permanent injunction, a district court may impose a running royalty to remedy possible future
infringement, at least after providing the parties with an opportunity to negotiate a rate privately. See Prism Techs. LLC v.
Sprint Spectrum L.P. , 849 F.3d 1360 , 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (Patent Act); 4Nimmer on Copyright § 14.06[D] (2018). A
reasonable royalty and statutory damages may be imposed even if the accused infringer reaps nothing from infringement.
See F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts , 344 U.S. 228 , 233,73 S.Ct. 222 , 97 L.Ed. 276 (1952) (allowing statutory
damages ""[e]ven for uninjurious and unprofitable invasions of copyright""); On Davis, 246 F.3d at 166 (recognizing that
reasonable royalty damages may be awarded even if the infringement proves unprofitable). Given this arsenal of monetary
remedies, a district court can still award meaningful monetary relief where, as here, an accused infringer distributes an
infringing product for free and the copyright holder makes no use of a work.

TD Bank protests that it abandoned its request for statutory damages, so it lacks an adequate remedy at law. But where an
adequate remedy at law exists, ""the party seeking redress must pursue it."" Parker v. Winnipiseogee Lake Cotton & Woolen

Co. , 67 U.S. (2 Black) 545, 551, 17 L.Ed. 333 (1862) (emphasis added); see Goadby v. Philadelphia Elec. Co. , 639 F.2d
417 , 122 (3d Cir. 1981) ;

[928 F.3d 283]

Shaw v. United States , 891 F.2d 602 , 603 (6th Cir. 1989). TD Bank therefore cannot bolster its case for equitable relief by
abandoning its request for statutory damages.

To be clear, we in no way suggest that all copyright infringement can be adequately remedied through damages; that


--- Page 11 ---
""categorical rule"" would flout eBay just as much as a rule favoring injunctive relief. See 547 U.S. at 393 , 126 S.Ct. 1837 .
The availability of some legal remedy does not mean such a remedy is adequate. But, at a minimum, where the copyright
holder presents no evidence of actual harm and relies solely on the exclusive nature of the rights conferred by the Copyright
Act, a district court abuses its discretion by concluding that the copyright holder lacks an adequate remedy at law.

3. Balance of Equities

The District Court’s balance-of-harms analysis suffers from much the same flaws as its irreparable-injury determination: It
relied solely on TD Bank’s ""property interest in its copyrighted material""—in other words, the right to exclude—and
dismissed any hardship that the injunction would inflict on Hill because ""Hill has a property interest in the 2012 Book only to
the extent [it] does not infringe the 2007 Manuscript."" App. 10. But by that measure, the balance of hardships would always
favor the copyright holder.

At least three considerations inform how much credence to give a defendant’s claimed hardship: (1) whether the defendant's
own financial investment, effort, or expressive contribution eclipses the infringing aspect, see Silverstein v. Penguin Putnam.
Inc. . 368 F.3d 77 , 84-85 (2d Cir. 2004) :Abend v. MCA, Inc. , 863 F.2d 1465 , 1479 (9th Cir. 1988), (2) how easily the
infringing content could be separated from the defendant’s product, 12 see Opticians Ass'n of Am. v. Indep. Opticians of Am.
920 F.2d 187 , 197 (3d Cir. 1990) ;Abend_,_ 863 F.2d at 1479 , and (3) the degree to which the defendant reasonably
believed his conduct was non-infringing, see Opticians Ass’n of Am.__920 F.2d at 197 ; Helene Curtis Indus., Inc. v. Church
& Dwight Co._, 560 F.2d 1325 , 1333 (7th Cir. 1977). All three factors play a role; no matter how much a defendant invests in
a product and how deeply intertwined that investment is with the infringing content, a wanton infringer may deserve little
sympathy from a court contemplating equitable relief. See Opticians Ass’n of Am.__920 F.2d at 197 ; Kos Pharm. v. Andrx
Corp. , 369 F.3d 700 , 728-29 (3d Cir. 2004) (refusing to countenance ""aknowing infringer that constructs its business
around its infringement"" (emphasis added) (citation and internal alterations omitted)); see also Douglas Laycock & Richard
L. Hasen, Modern American Remedies 419-20, 446—47 (5th ed. 2019) (stressing the defendant’s culpability ve/ non ). But
even where a defendant makes a strong showing, a copyright holder’s hardship may be so devastating that the balance of
equities nevertheless tips in its favor. See, e.g., Opticians Ass’n of Am.__920 F.2d at 197 ; Abend__ 863 F.2d at 1479
(declining to issue injunction where the success of the infringing work ""resulted in large part from factors completely
unrelated to the underlying story"" and ""defendants could not possibly separate out [their contributions] from the underlying

[928 F.3d 284]

work""). In short, balancing aims ""to ensure that the issuance of an injunction would not harm the infringer more than a denial
would harm the [copyright] owner."" Opticians Ass’n of Am.__920 F.2d at 197 .

Here, considering the interests on both sides, the balance of equities favors neither party. TD Bank has not submitted any
evidence of actual harm, much less irreparable harm. But the equities do not particularly favor Hill either. True, as TD Bank
admits, no more than 16% of Hill’s 2012 book infringes its copyright, and Hill's ownership defense, though ultimately
unsuccessful, had considerable merit. And, without TD Bank’s recent concession that the 2016 book does not infringe its
copyright, we would need to scrutinize whether the book could practically be rewritten in a non-infringing manner without
detracting from Hill’s story or voice. With the benefit of hindsight and TD Bank’s recent concession, however, we know that
Hill needed only about one month to develop a non-infringing version. Under these circumstances, we decline to hold that
the equities weigh in either party’s favor.

4. Public Interest

Hill and amici contend that the District Court erred in discounting the harm that the injunction could inflict on the American
public by depriving it of the ability to purchase the work from any lawful source. To determine where the public interest lies, a
court should weigh the ""advantages and disadvantages"" to the public of ""employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction
over the other available methods of enforcement."" United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop.__ 532 U.S. 483 , 498,
121 S.Ct. 1711 , 149 L.Ed.2d 722 (2001) (citation omitted). We agree that this factor weighs against the injunction: Copyright
leaves a narrow but important role for weighing the public’s right to access expressive works, at least where a copyright
owner pursues an injunction not to safeguard the commercial marketability of a work but merely to suppress unwelcome
speech.

Though not ""categorically immune from challenges under the First Amendment,"" copyright law generally does not invite First
Amendment scrutiny, insofar as ""copyright’s built-in free speech safeguards""—in particular, the idea-expression dichotomy
and fair use—adequately guarantee free expression. Eldred__537 U.S. at 221 , 123 S.Ct. 769 (citation omitted); see Harper
& Row. 471 U.S. at 555 —60, 105 S.Ct. 2218 . And copyright law strives to spur the creation and diffusion of free expression
by granting authors ""a marketable right to the use of one’s expression."" /d. at 558, 105 S.Ct. 2218 . For these reasons, the
Supreme Court has rebuffed constitutional challenges that would have enlarged the fair-use doctrine, id. at 560, 105 S.Ct.
2218 , or invalidated Congress's retroactive extensions of copyrights,E/dred_, 537 U.S. at 221 , 123 S.Ct. 769 ; Golan v.
Holder , 565 U.S. 302 , 335-36, 132 S.Ct. 873 , 181 L.Ed.2d 835 (2012) .

Yet it hardly follows that the public interest always favors granting injunctive relief or that, in exercising its remedial
discretion, a court must ignore whether an injunction would indefinitely preclude the public from accessing a work. To the
contrary, the Supreme Court has recognized that injunctive relief does not always serve copyright’s goal of ""stimulat[ing] the


--- Page 12 ---
creation and publication of edifying matter."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 578 n.10, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citation omitted). By
considering the public’s interest in accessing works, a court does not disturb copyright’s liability regime, see Eldred_, 537
U.S. at 221 , 123 S.Ct. 769 ; Golan__565 U.S. at 324 , 132 S.Ct. 873 , but rather exercises its centuries-old

[928 F.3d 285]

authority to choose between alternative ""means of enforcing the statute."" Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop.__ 532 U.S. at 497
—98, 121 S.Ct. 1711 ; see Il Joseph Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence 271 (3d ed. 1843) (commending the
""wisdom"" of courts of equity in ""constantly declin[ing] to lay down any rule, which shall limit their power and discretion as to
the particular cases, in which such injunctions shall be granted, or withheld"").

Consistent with this view, the Supreme Court and other Courts of Appeals have emphasized the right of access to works of
public interest. For example, in a case cited approvingly by the Supreme Court as an example of where the public interest
opposed injunctive relief, see Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578 n.10, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , the Ninth Circuit refused to enjoin the
classic Hitchcock movie ""The Rear Window"" partly because ""an injunction could cause public injury by denying the public
the opportunity to view a classic film for many years to come,"" Abend__ 863 F.2d at 1479 . The Second Circuit likewise
vacated an injunction enjoining a biography about Howard Hughes that allegedly infringed copyrights that Hughes had
acquired to suppress the work, with a two-judge concurrence pointing out that the ""spirit of the First Amendment"" counsels
against allowing anyone to use copyright to ""interfere[ ] with the public’s right to be informed regarding matters of general
interest."" Rosemont Enters., Inc. v. Random House, Inc. , 366 F.2d 303 , 311 (2d Cir. 1966) ;see also Suntrust Bank , 268
F.3d at 1276 (stressing ""the public interest is always served in promoting First Amendment values"").

By recognizing the public’s interest in accessing intriguing works, we do not countenance blatant piracy or indulge in
second-guessing of a copyright holder’s business model. Cf. Campbell__510 U.S. at 578 n.10, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (focusing on
derivative works). And, even where the public interest in accessing works may appropriately be considered, a district court
may well conclude that the public interest nevertheless favors injunctive relief. Cf. Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc. , 869
F.3d 848 , 867 (9th Cir. 2017) (concluding that a district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing injunction relief even
though the content owners did not offer a competing service). But, at least where a copyright holder wields its exclusive
rights to suppress unwelcome speech, a district court’s public-interest analysis should consider a work’s continued
availability.

Hill may perhaps not be the next prize-winning, or even best-selling, business-book author. But he has a story to tell and
readers eager to learn from him. This injunction deprived the American public of the ability to purchase this book from any
lawful source for the foreseeable future. At the same time, whatever spurred TD Bank to bankroll this copyright litigation, it
was not a desire to protect the commercial value of the 2007 manuscript: By its own admission, TD Bank has no real
intention of ever publishing or licensing that work.

This injunction also inflicted a far more subtle and insidious harm on the public by placing Hill in jeopardy of a contempt
finding for sharing anything that ""sound[s] too much /ike himself in the 2007 manuscript."" Br. of Amici Intellectual Property
Law Professors at 13. In this manner, a copyright injunction can limit the public’s access to expressive content well beyond
the work at issue in a lawsuit. Far from hypothetical, that danger came true here when TD Bank threatened to bring a
contempt motion against Hill for the 2016 book, which it did not retract until its appellate response brief. A less financially
secure defendant may well have given up. Thus, on balance, the public interest here

[928 F.3d 286]

also militates against this permanent injunction.

keRK

As an appellate court, we police only the margins of a district court’s exercise of equitable discretion. But where, as here, a
district court strays from a context-specific analysis and relies instead on broad propositions, it exceeds the bounds of its
discretion. In this case, no invocation of abstract principles can obscure that TD Bank suffered no actual harm from Hill’s
infringement and the Bank had adequate remedies at law. As such, although we will affirm the District Court's grant of
summary judgment to TD Bank on ownership and liability, we will vacate the permanent injunction and remand for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

132 F.3d 902 , 904 n.1 (3d Cir. 1997) ). A review of ""the record"" in this case reveals that TD Bank has intentionally and
knowingly abandoned the issue of assignment. See, e.g. , Robinson v. First State Cmty. Action Agency , 920 F.3d 182, 187
(3d Cir. 2019) ("" ‘Waiver is the ‘intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.’ "" (quoting Barna v. Bd. of Sch.
Dirs. of Panther Valley Sch. Dist. . 877 F.3d 136, 147 (3d Cir. 2017) )).

It is undisputed that TD Bank failed to argue below that, even if the 2007 manuscript does not rise to the level of a work for
hire, Hill assigned any interest he may have had in the manuscript to Commerce Bank. But TD Bank did more than merely
fail to raise a particular issue. It affirmatively conceded that the letter ""is not an assignment.""

In ""Plaintiffs’ Responses to Defendant's First Set of Requests for Admissions,"" TD Bank made the following admission:

26. Admit that Mr. Hill never signed a document or any other writing assigning right, title or interest in the
Unpublished Manuscript to Commerce.

OBJECTION: Plaintiff objects as ""any other writing"" is vague and is nowhere defined and requires Plaintiff to
speculate as to meaning.

[928 F.3d 287]

RESPONSE: Subject to the foregoing objection and without waiving the same, admitted to the extent that the
Guaranty is not an assignment but rather an acknowledgement that Commerce is the initial owner of the
copyright in the Unpublished Manuscript.

(JA1307; see also id. (making same objection and response to request to admit that Hill never signed document or any other
writing assigning right, title, or interest to TD Bank).)

TD Bank thereby admitted that the letter is not an assignment but rather an acknowledgement that Commerce Bank has
always been the copyright owner from (to borrow language from TD Bank’s appellate brief) ""day one"" pursuant to the work-
for-hire doctrine (Appellee’s Brief at 37). ""The purpose of [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 36(a) is to narrow the issues for
trial to those which are genuinely contested."" United Coal Cos. v. Powell Constr. Co. . 839 F.2d 958 , 967 (3d Cir. 1988)
(citing Webb v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. , 81 F.R.D. 431, 436 (E.D. Pa. 1978) United States v. Watchmakers of
Switzerland Info. Ctr., Inc. , 25 F.R.D. 197, 201 (S.D.N.Y. 1959) ). TD Bank did not deny Hill’s request for admissionSee,
e.g. , id. (""Where, as here, issues in dispute are requested to be admitted, a denial is a perfectly reasonable response.""). In
fact, TD Bank responded to similar admission requests by denying them, quoting or referencing, inter alia, the letter, and
asserting that the document spoke for itself. It also could have answered in the alternative if it really believed that the letter
could be considered an assignment. For instance, it could have stated that, while the document constitutes an
acknowledgement of Commerce Bank’s initial ownership, ""the Guaranty is an assignment"" to the extent Commerce Bank is
not considered to be the initial owner. But it did not do so. Instead of leaving open the possibility that it became the copyright
owner by means of a transfer or assignment from the original owner (or co-owner), TD Bank went so far as to emphasize the
term ""initial"" in ""the initial owner."" Similarly, ""Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts Not in
Dispute In Support of Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment"" stated: ""Undisputed that the Guaranty does not contain
such an express provision [in which Mr. Hill assigned any right, title, or interest in the Unpublished Manuscript to
Commerce]."" (JA1388). ""Disputed that the lack of such a provision provides Mr. Hill with any ownership interest in the
copyright in the 2007 Manuscript."" (Id. (citing JA477, JA1139).)

TD Bank’s pattern of failing to raise or contest the issue of assignment has continued on appeal.

In his opening appellate brief, Hill argues at some length that the District Court erred in relying on the letter. ""The only
inquiry to which these contracts might be relevant is whether, after Mr. Hill’s ownership vested, he executed an agreement
transferring the copyright after creation, in accordance with 17 U.S.C. § 204."" (Appellant’s Brief at 47-48 (citing Brownstein v.
Lindsay , 742 F.3d 55, 68 (3d Cir. 2014) ).) Citing to TD Bank’s Responses to Defendant's First Set of Requests for
Admissions, Hill asserts that ""TD Bank concedes that no such writing exists,"" which, in turn, purportedly entitles him to
judgment as a matter of law. (1d. at 48 (citing JA1307).) According to Hill, the District Court, among other things, failed to
analyze the statutory writing requirement, acknowledge TD Bank’s admission, properly apply New York’s contract law in its
consideration of the letter and the publishing agreement, or recognize that there is a presumption against transfers of
copyright ownership unless they are clearly

[928 F.3d 288]

stated. In the process, Hill (indirectly) cites TD Bank’s Response to Defendant’s Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts Not
in Dispute In Support of Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. (See id. (""In fact, there is no evidence of any
agreement over copyright ownership between Commerce and Mr. Hill, whose signatures never appear on the same
contract."" (citing JA1586)).)

Faced with these assertions, one would expect TD Bank to respond (at least in the form of an alternative argument) that Hill
did assign any interest he may have had in the manuscript pursuant to § 204 and New York law. At the very least, it would
be expected that a litigant would deny an adversary’s concession assertion if it truly believed that no such thing had


--- Page 14 ---
occurred. Yet TD Bank does nothing of the sort. Instead, it simply characterizes Hill’s contention ""[t]hat ‘[t]he Guaranty never
says that Mr. Hill agrees to transfer exclusive ownership to Commerce’ "" as ""a basic mistake regarding the Copyright Act's
‘work made for hire’ provision."" (Appellee’s Brief at 37 (quoting Appellant's Brief at 48).) ""Because the 2007 Manuscript was
a ‘work made for hire,’ (see [id. at 39-47] ), TD Bank is the work’s statutory ‘author’ and sole copyright owner on day one,
17 U.S.C. § 201(b), and no transfer to TD Bank is required."" (Id. ) According to TD Bank, it is actually Hill’s obligation to
produce a written agreement transferring ownership to him.

TD Bank did not argue that there was any assignment from Hill to Commerce Bank until oral argument, after this Court
directed the parties to be prepared to discuss this issue of whether the letter constitutes a valid assignment under New York
law and the Copyright Act. | do not believe it is appropriate for us to overlook what TD Bank (an obviously sophisticated
litigant represented by able counsel) has done—and not done—regarding the issue of assignment throughout the course of
this litigation. Recently, this Court considered a party’s course of conduct to decide that it had waived its objection to a
particular jury instruction. See, e.g. , Robinson , 920 F.3d at 184 (""We hold that First State has waived this argument
because of its continued acquiescence to Robinson’s case theory, its encouragement of the adoption of the very jury
instruction to which it now objects, and its failure to include this error in its post-trial briefing.""). In turn, the ground upon
which Erie Telecommunications relied was raised in one of the appellee’s affirmative defenses, summarily rejected by the
district court, and then addressed in the brief that the appellee filed on appeal. Erie Telecomms. , 853 F.2d at 1088 & n.8,
1094 n.16. Given its concession below that the letter is not an assignment as well as its dismissal on appeal of Hill’s own
assignment assertions, TD Bank has waived the assignment issue.

Assuming arguendo that the issue of assignment is properly before us, | do not agree with the majority’s conclusion that
Hill’s letter meets the legal requirements for an assignment of a copyright interest. As the majority recognizes, ""courts do not
lightly infer that a party has assigned his interest in a copyright, particularly given the Copyright Act’s writing requirement,
and in doubtful cases, a document should not be construed to divest an author completely of his ownership interest.""
(Majority Opinion at 275 (citing Baisden v. I’m Ready Prods.., Inc. . 693 F.3d 491 , 500 (5th Cir. 2012) ;Radio Television
Espanola S.A. v. New World Entm’t, Ltd. . 183 F.3d 922 , 927 (9th Cir. 1999) ;Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Dumas , 53 F.3d 549 ,
564 (2d Cir. 1995) ).) Under applicable New York law, a contract is unambiguous if its language possesses "" ‘a definite and
precise meaning, unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the [agreement] itself, and

[928 F.3d 289]

concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.’ "" Greenfield v. Philles Records, Inc. , 98 N.Y.2d
562 , 750 N.Y.S.2d 565 , 780 N.E.2d 166 , 170-11 (2002) (quoting Breed v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. , 46 N.Y.2d 351 , 413
N.Y.S.2d 352 , 385 N.E.2d 1280 , 1282 (1978) ).

The letter here is doubtful and ambiguous.

According to the majority, ""Hill’s commitments together convey an unmistakable intent to effect a present transfer of any
interest he possessed in the manuscript."" (Id. at 275.) | agree that no specific language is necessary to satisfy the
requirements for an effective assignment under state and federal law. See, e.g. , Radio Television Espanola , 183 F.3d at
927 (""No magic words must be included in a document to satisfy § 204(a).""); Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Romano , 147
A.D.3d 1021 1023, 48 N.Y.S.3d 237 (N.Y. App. Div. 2017) (observing that no special language or formalities are necessary
to effect assignment). Nevertheless, the assignor must in some fashion have "" ‘ manifested an intention to make a present
transfer of his rights to the assignee.’ "" Deutsche Bank , 147 A.D.3d at 1023 (quoting 9-47 Corbin on Contracts § 47.7); see.
e.g. , Roger Miller Music, Inc. v. Sony/ATV Publishing, LLC , 477 F.3d 383 , 391 (6th Cir. 2007) (""Nevertheless, ‘[s]o long as
the parties’ intent is clear, a transfer of copyright need not include any particular language.’ "" (quoting Gilleland v. Schanhals
, 55 F. App'x 257, 260 (6th Cir. 2003) ). According to the Ninth Circuit:

Section 204 ’s writing requirement is not unduly burdensome; it necessitates neither protracted negotiations nor
substantial expense. The rule is really quite simple: If the copyright holder agrees to transfer ownership to
another party, that party must get the copyright holder to sign a piece of paper saying so. It doesn’t have to be
the Magna Charta; a one-line pro forma statement will do.

Effects Assocs., Inc. v. Cohen , 908 F.2d 555 , 557 (9th Cir. 1990).

Neither the letter nor the publishing agreement included ""a one-line pro forma statement."" Specifically, the documentation at
issue here did not state that Hill is assigning, transferring, or granting his copyright interest in the manuscript to Commerce
Bank—nor did it say that such an assignment, transfer, or grant had already occurred (or would take place in the future).
See, e.g. , Baisden , 693 F.3d at 500 (""That [royalty] check merely states that it was for ‘ Men Cry in the DarkFall 2005
Royalties (Paid in Full).’ The check does not expressly refer to an assignment of copyrights. See [ Playboy Enters. , 53 F.3d
at 564 ] (applying clearly erroneous standard and deferring to district court’s determination that check for past ‘assignment ...
of all rights, title and interest’ was insufficient to transfer copyrights).""). Certainly, the inclusion of this sort of language would
have dispelled doubt and ""convey an unmistakable intent"" to effect a transfer (_id. at ). Although not strictly required as
a matter of law (see id. at 274-75 n.8), the existence of a document executed by the putative assignor and assignee would
also have been stronger evidence of an assignment than what we have here, i.e., a publishing agreement executed by
Commerce Bank and Portfolio, and a letter signed by Hill addressed to Portfolio.

In turn, Hill's letter to Portfolio and the publishing agreement between Commerce Bank and Portfolio could be reasonably
read as indicating that there was no copyright assignment. As the majority explains, the letter consists of two principal
covenants: (1) ""Hill acknowledged the publishing agreement, a copy of which was attached to the letter, and ‘guarantee[d],


--- Page 15 ---
promise[d] and agree[d] with the Publisher
[928 F.3d 290]

... that the Author [i-e., Commerce Bank] will, in all respects, faithfully perform and fulfill all obligations of the Agreement’ "" (
id. at 274 (quoting JA1139)); and (2) ""Hill ‘unconditionally guarantee[d] that the Work is a work made for hire within the
meaning of the United States Copyright Law and that the Author is the owner of copyright in the Work and has full power
and authority to enter into the Agreement’ "" (id. (quoting JA1139)). ""That publishing agreement provided that ‘the Author
[i.e., Commerce Bank] is the sole and exclusive owner of all rights granted to the Publisher in this Agreement and has not
assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered the same; ... that the Author has full power to enter into this Agreement and to
make the grants herein contained.’ "" (Id. (quoting JA1142).) The documentation thereby indicates that the letter itself
constitutes a guarantee as opposed to an assignment—and that Commerce Bank ""is the work’s statutory ‘author’ and sole
copyright owner on day one and no transfer to [Commerce Bank] is required"" (Appellee’s Brief at 37 (citation omitted)).

According to the majority, the latter provisions of the letter do not resemble a true guarantee. But it also acknowledges that
Hill’s commitment guaranteeing, promising, and agreeing that Commerce Bank would fulfill its obligations ""could by itself
suggest a guarantee"" (Majority Opinion at 274-75). While not dispositive, the repeated use of this sort of ""guarantee""
language (at the very least) represents a highly unconventional expression of an intent to effect a transfer. Furthermore, the
cited cases did not consider whether the ""guarantee"" at issue actually constituted an assignment under New York law. See,
e.g. , N.Y. Plumber's Specialties Co. v. 91 E. End Corp. , 42 N.Y.2d 865, 397 N.Y.S.2d 778 , 366 N.E.2d 866 , 867 (1977)
(""Although described as a guarantee this writing is actually an agreement or promise to pay appellant's own obligation for
purchases made on its own account."" (quoting Deeves & Son v. Manhattan Life Ins. Co. , 195 N.Y. 324, 88 N.E. 395 , 396
(1909) )); Brewster Transit Mix Corp. v. McLean , 169 A.D.2d 1036 1037, 565 N.Y.S.2d 316 (N.Y. App. Div. 1991) (""Despite
the parties’ use of the word guarantee, we are of the view that the nature of defendant’s obligation is the same as that of his
corporation and, therefore, the only reasonable interpretation of the writing is that which makes defendant a co-obligor of his
corporation’s debts to plaintiff, not a guarantor of the payment of those debts."" (citing Am. Trading Co. v. Fish , 42 N.Y.2d 20
, 24, 396 N.Y.S.2d 617 , 364 N.E.2d 1309 (1977) )). Even if parts of the letter do not really look like a typical guarantee (i.e.,
an agreement to pay a principal obligor’s debt upon the principal obligor’s default), the same could be said with respect to
the letter’s resemblance to an assignment, especially given what the document did not say (and what it did). In fact, Hill
stated in the letter that ""I have an interest in the Author [Commerce Bank] and in having the Work published by the
Publisher,"" and thereby made these guarantees ""as an inducement to the Publisher to enter into the Agreement."" (JA1139.)
He clearly wanted the book to be published as opposed to expressing any sort of interest in effecting an assignment of his
existing copyright interest to his employer. In fact, | question whether he was really concerned with the intricacies of
copyright assignment and the work-for-hire doctrine in the first place.

Finally, the differences between assignment and the concept of a work for hire weigh against the majority’s assignment
determination. The agreement and the letter could be reasonably read as acknowledging that Commerce Bank was always
the exclusive owner of the manuscript as a work for hire. After all, the letter basically said as much, unconditionally
guaranteeing

[928 F.3d 291]

that the manuscript ""is a work made for hire within the meaning of the United States Copyright Law and that the Author is
the owner of copyright in the Work and has full power and authority to enter into the Agreement."" (JA1139.) Commerce
Bank warranted in the publishing agreement that it ""is the sole and exclusive owner of all rights granted to the Publisher in
this Agreement"" and ""has full power to enter into this Agreement and to make the grants herein contained."" (JA1142.) The
majority asserts that, although Hill’s assurance that the manuscript is a work made for hire is insufficient to make it one, this
assurance nevertheless ""denotes an intent to relinquish his interest in the copyright."" (Majority Opinion at 275 (citing 1
Nimmer on Copyright § 5.03[B][1][b][ii] )).) However, assignment and work for hire are two different concepts. As | have
already explained in my waiver discussion, TD Bank characterizes Hill’s assignment assertions as fundamentally mistaken.
It is TD Bank who insists that, because the manuscript is a work for hire, ""TD Bank [as Commerce Bank’s successor] is the
work’s statutory ‘author’ and sole copyright owner on day one and no transfer to TD Bank is required."" (Appellee’s Brief at 37
(citation omitted).) Where a work is made for hire, ""the employer ... is considered the author for purposes of this title, and,
unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument signed by them, owns all the rights comprised in
the copyright."" § 201(b). In contrast, a transfer or assignment implicates ""the conveyance"" (as § 204(a) puts it) of the
owner’s interest to another. A ""work for hire"" characterization thereby indicates that the employer has been the exclusive
copyright owner from the very beginning. Nimmer does state that an agreement whereby works prepared by the employee
but not prepared within the scope of employment are deemed to be works made for hire ""may be regarded as the equivalent
of a simple transfer of copyright from the employee to the employer."" 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 5.03[B][1][b][ii]. But the
treatise does not provide any further explanation, and it immediately qualifies the statement itself by pointing to additional
differences between a transfer and a work for hire, id. (""but will not trigger the various other legal consequences that flow
from the status of a ‘for hire’ work"" (footnote omitted)). (See, e.g. , Majority Opinion at 272-73 & n.7 (pointing out that
work’s status determines duration of copyright, author retains certain non-waivable rights to cancel transfer after 35-40 years
and perhaps waivable moral rights in proper attribution, and creator of work for hire lacks such rights).) In any event, the
specific letter at issue here still fails to manifest ""an unmistakable intent to effect a present transfer"" of Hill's copyright
interest (id. at 274).

For the foregoing reasons, | would vacate the District Court’s summary judgment disposition on the question of copyright
ownership and remand for further proceedings.

Notes:

1We recount the facts largely based on the parties’ statements of undisputed facts with occasional references directly to the testimony and documentary
evidence cited therein. For facts bearing on summary judgment, we view the record in the light most favorable to Hill, as the losing party. See Big Apple
BMW. Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc. 974 F.2d 1358 , 1363 (3d Cir. 1992).

2The District Court had jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1338(a).

3TD Bank's and Hill's motions to supplement the record on appeal are granted insofar as they pertain to events that transpired since the District Court's
decision. See Clark v. K-Mart Corp. , 979 F.2d 965 , 967 (3d Cir. 1992) (limitations on supplementing the record do not preclude appellate court from
considering ""unrebutted"" evidence to determine whether an appeal is moot); see also McKay v. Federspiel , 823 F.3d 862 , 868 (6th Cir. 2016) (appellate
court may consider after-acquired evidence pertaining to the merits of a claim ""for the sake of thoroughness"" if it would ""not change the outcome"" of the
appeal (citation omitted)).

8 Although we ultimately vacate the injunction under eBay 's four-factor test, we decline to merely assume that TD Bank exclusively owns the 2007
manuscript and that Hill’s liability defenses fail. Without resolving the issue here, we note that several circuits have held that a plaintiff must demonstrate
ownership of exclusive rights to establish ""standing,"" without explaining whether they mean this requirement is jurisdictional. See Urbont v. Sony Music
Entm’t., 831 F.3d 80 , 88 n.6 (2d Cir. 2016) ;_Righthaven LLC v. Hoehn , 716 F.3d 1166 , 1171 (9th Cir. 2013) ; see also Barefoot Architect, Inc. v. Bunge

632 F.3d 822 , 827 (3d Cir. 2011) (recounting that the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing because the plaintiff did not own any
rights in the work). The Federal Circuit views the concomitant ownership requirement under the Patent Act as jurisdictional. See, e.g. ,_Fieldturf_Inc. v.
Sw. Recreational Indus., Inc. _ 357 F.3d 1266 , 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Resolving the ownership dispute on this appeal will put to rest any jurisdictional
concerns and, along with considering Hill's liability defenses, will help advance this litigation on remand.

&Notably, the Lanham Act does preclude a defendant from challenging, among other issues, the ownership of a registered trademark after five years if
the registered owner complies with certain formalities; the Act calls these marks ""incontestable."" 15 U.S.C. §§ 1065, 1115(b). The Copyright Act contains
no analogous provision.

ZA work's status also determines the duration of the copyright: A work-for-hire copyright has a fixed term of 95-120 years, while an ordinary copyright
generally persists for the life of the author plus 70 years. 17 U.S.C. §§ 302(b), (c).

8To the extent that Hill suggests that an assignment would fail unless he entered into an agreement directly with the assignee (Commerce Bank), he is
mistaken. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 327 cmt. a (1981).

2 Our dissenting colleague slices TD Bank's argument thinly, arguing that we should not affirm because it ""waived"" the assignment issue. While we take
this opportunity to clarify that a work cannot fall within the scope of employment without satisfying agency-law criteria, the District Court's contract-law
analysis, though adopting incorrect nomenclature, was sound. In fact, Hill (correctly) observes in his opening brief that the District Court conflated the two
doctrines and therefore devotes more than four pages to the assignment question (even labeling it as such). In considering whether Hill assigned any
interest he had, we do not stray from the passages in the agreements that TD Bank identified in its interrogatory response as giving it exclusive
ownership and that the parties dispute on appeal. Where two arguments relate so closely, neither is waived or forfeited. See, e.g. , Lebron v. Nat'l R.R.
Passenger Corp. 513 U.S. 374 , 380, 115 S.Ct. 961 , 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995) (considering an alternative argument where the petition, ""though couched
in terms of a different but closely related theory, fairly embraced [it]"").

In any event, we may affirm on any ground supported by the record as long as the appellee did not waive —as opposed to forfeit —the issue. Compare
Bistrian v. Levi, 912 F.3d 79 , 88-89 (3d Cir. 2018) (affirming in part based on a ""threshold question of law"" that the appellees neither raised below nor
on appeal), with Holk v. Snapple Beverage Corp. , 575 F.3d 329 , 336 (3d Cir. 2009) (appellee waived a separate argument by ""explicitly disclaim[ing]"" it).
Much like the other statements our dissenting colleague references, the Bank’s response to a request for admission admitted the lack of an assignment
only "" to the extent that "" the Bank argued that initial ownership had already vested with the Bank under the same agreement. App. 1307 (emphasis
added). A request for admission does not serve as a proper substitute for a contentions interrogatory, see United Coal Cos. v. Powell Const. Co. , 839
F.2d 958 , 967-68 (3d Cir. 1988), and Hill neither sought clarification of TD Bank’s response nor moved to have the matter deemed fully admitted, see
Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(6) ; 8B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 2260 (3d ed. 2019). The Bank has consistently argued that it
exclusively owns the 2007 manuscript under the letter agreement, and we see no reason to treat its mislabeling of that substantially correct contract-law
argument as the ""intentional relinquishment ... of a known right.""_Robinson v. First State Cmty. Action Agency , 920 F.3d 182 , 187 (3d Cir. 2019).

10 Garcia accepted that a court may consider these collateral injuries where a copyright owner has a ""strong copyright claim.” /d. at 746.

11Nor would characterizing copyright infringement as compelled speech make much sense. Most obviously, copyright infringement generally lacks the
state action needed to implicate the First Amendment. See Max v. Republican Comm. of Lancaster Cty. , 587 F.3d 198 , 200 (3d Cir. 2009). And even if
it did, infringement would not equate with compelled speech because, regardless of whether the author takes offense, the infringer’s use does not coerce
the copyright owner to ""personally speak the government's message"" or ""to host or accommodate another speaker's message"" so that ""the complaining
speaker's own message was affected."" Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc__547 U.S. 47 , 63, 126 S.Ct. 1297 , 164 L.Ed.2d 156
(2006) . Indeed, precisely because few authors would license their work for criticism or ridicule, copyright’s fair-use defense provides special protection
to derivative works like parodies. See Campbell__510 U.S. at 579 -81, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ;_Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co. . 268 F.3d 1257 , 1271
(11th Cir. 2001). Nor have the Copyright Act’s longstanding compulsory licensing provisions, see, e.g. , 17 U.S.C. § 111 (compulsory cable license); 17
U.S.C. § 115 (compulsory cover license), ever come under serious First Amendment challenge as compelled speech.

12 We note that the question of separability in the balance of hardships differs from that at issue in the merger doctrine. The merger doctrine, as a narrow
defense to liability, considers ex ante whether an idea could have been expressed in numerous ways, see Educ. Testing Servs.__793 F.2d at 539 , while
the balance of hardships assesses afterwards how practicable extricating the infringing content from the defendant's product would be, given obstacles
such as sunk costs and path dependency, see Abend_. 863 F.2d at 1479 .

MEMORANDUM & ORDER
NICHOLAS G. GARAUFIS, United States District Judge.

Plaintiff Alex Cruz brings this action against Defendant Cox Media Group, LLC (""Cox"") alleging infringement of Plaintiff's
copyright in a photograph he took of the arrest of terror suspect Sayfullo Saipov. (Compl. (Dkt. 1).) Before the court are
cross motions for partial summary judgment. Plaintiff seeks judgment on Cox's liability for infringement and dismissal of

Cox's affirmative defenses. ( See PI.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Part. Summ. J. (Dkt. 29) (""Pl.'s Mem.""); PI.'s Mem. in Opp.
to Def.'s Cross Mot. for Part. Summ. J. (Dkt.

[444 F.Supp.3d 462]

40) (""PI.'s Opp."").) Cox opposes Plaintiff's motion and seeks either a judgment of no infringement or, in the alternative, fair
use. ( See Def.'s Cross Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Part. Summ. J. (Dkt. 34) (""Def. Mem.""); Def's Reply in Supp. of Cross Mot.
for Summ. J. (Dkt. 42) (Def. Reply"").) For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion is GRANTED and Defendant's motion is
DENIED.

|. BACKGROUND

The court constructs the following statement of facts from the parties' Local Rule 56.1 Statements and the admissible
evidence they submitted. Except where otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed. All evidence is construed in the
light most favorable to the non-moving party with all ""reasonable inferences"" drawn in its favor. ING Bank N.V. v. M/V
TEMARA, IMO No. 9333929_, 892 F.3d 511 , 518 (2d Cir. 2018).

Plaintiff is Alex Cruz, a New York City native who works at Jennifer Convertibles, a furniture company in downtown Brooklyn.
(Oct. 18, 2018 Tr. of Cruz Dep. (""Cruz Dep."") (Dkt. 37-1) 9:17-25.) Cruz is not and has never been a professional
photographer. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. (""Def. 56.1"") (Dkt. 39) § 37.) On October 31, 2017, Cruz was walking on Chambers
Street in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City, on the way to visit the apartment of his girlfriend, Trish McFarlane. ( /d.
442.) Crux noticed a ""big commotion"" near the intersection of Chambers and West Streets, and saw a man acting erratically
as law enforcement officers approached him. ( Id. ) As Cruz saw the scene unfolding, he reached for his iPhone and took a
photograph of a criminal suspect named Sayfullo Saipov, lying on the ground, being apprehended by New York City police
after Saipov had committed a terrorist attack (the ""Photograph""). ( See Ex. A hereto.)

After taking the Photograph, Cruz continued on to McFarlane's apartment and sent the Photograph to a friend, Lenny
Bautista. (Def. 56.1 § 46.) Until Bautista informed him otherwise, Cruz believed he had taken a ""simple picture"" of somebody
who appeared to be ""acting crazy."" ( /d. § 47.) Bautista posted the Photograph to his Instagram account @illmaticNYC and,
initially, took credit for the Photograph. (Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. (""Pl. 56.1"") (Dkt. 33) 4 10.) However, McFarlane posted her own
message on Instagram, clarifying that it was Cruz, and not Bautista, who had taken the Photograph. ( /d. ) Media
organizations then began contacting McFarlane, asking her to seek permission from Cruz to republish the Photograph.
Shortly thereafter, Cruz entered into two separate licensing agreements (with Cable News Network, Inc. (""CNN""), and NBC
News (""NBC""), respectively), in which Cruz granted the outlets permission to publish the Photograph in exchange for
licensing fees and credit. ( /d. ¢ 11.) The parties dispute the exact time Cruz entered into these agreements with CNN and
NBC: Cruz states that he entered into the agreements ""on or around October 31, 2017,"" ( See Pl. 56.1 F§ 12, 13), while Cox
maintains that CNN and NBC did not send proposed licensing agreements to Cruz until November 1, 2017, and that the
October 31, 2017 licensing agreements Cruz produced in discovery are not final executed documents. ( See Def. 56.1 9
12, 13.) Regardless, it is undisputed that media outlets expressed interest in publishing the Photograph and sought to enter
into licensing agreements with Cruz to do so.

One media company that did not seek to enter into a licensing agreement with Cruz was Cox, a national media company
with 13 television stations, 61 radio stations,


--- Page 2 ---
[444 F.Supp.3d 463]

four newspapers, and 72 websites. (Def. 56.1 36.) Cox's media portfolio includes the WSB-TV television station in Atlanta,
Georgia, as well as its associated wsbtv.com website. ( /d. ) On October 31, 2017, Cox published a news story on its WSB-
TV website, eventually bearing the title "" 8 dead in ‘cowardly act of terror’ in New York City’ (the ""Article""). ( Id. 4 55.) Later
that same day, the Photograph was added to the gallery of video and photographic content for the Article. ( /d. ) The
Photograph appeared, in full, as the second item in a gallery of video and photographic content positioned below both the
headline and the date and time that the Article was last updated on the WSB-TV website, as well as on Cox's Twitter and
Facebook pages. (Decl. of James Trigg (""Trigg Decl."") (Dkt. 37) 5; see also Oct. 31, 2017 WSB-TV Tweet (""WSB Tweet"")
(Dkt. 30-5) at ECF 2; Oct. 31, 2017 WSB-TV Facebook Post (""WSB Facebook Post"") at ECF 2.) Cox did not credit Cruz as
the author of the Photograph on the face of the Article or on the WSB Tweet and Facebook Post, nor did Cox seek Cruz's
permission to publish the Photograph or license the Photograph directly from Cruz. (PI. 56.1 9 21-24.)

On November 1, 2017, Cruz, acting without counsel, filed a copyright application with the U.S. Copyright Office seeking to
register the Photograph (as well as another photograph Cruz took of the same scene). (Nov. 1, 2017 Copyright Application
(Dkt. 37-1) at ECF 91.) A few days later, on November 7, 2017, Cruz, now through counsel, filed a new registration of the
Photograph with the Copyright Office (PI. 56.1 § 31; Cruz Dep. at 51:21-54:12.) The application was approved and Cruz
currently possesses a registration certificate for the Photograph, numbered VA 2-074-488 and dated November 7, 2017. (PI.
56.1 § 32; see also Certificate of Registration (Dkt. 31-2) at 1.)

Il. LEGAL STANDARD

A court must grant summary judgment when ""the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and
the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(a). ""A ‘material’ fact is one capable of influencing
the case's outcome under governing substantive law, and a ‘genuine’ dispute is one as to which the evidence would permit a
reasonable juror to find for the party opposing the motion."" Figueroa v. Mazza , 825 F.3d 89 , 98 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. .477 U.S. 242 , 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) ). The movant may discharge

Ill. DISCUSSION
A. Copyright Infringement

Cruz moves for summary judgment on the issue of copyright infringement, arguing that Cox infringed his copyright by
unlawfully publishing the Photograph for its own use. (PI.'s Mem. at 6; PI's. Opp. at 1.) The court finds that the undisputed
facts demonstrate Cox's liability for copyright infringement and grants Cruz's motion.

""To establish [copyright] infringement two elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of
constituent elements of the work that are original.""_Feist Publ'ns. Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. _ 499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct.
1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) .

1. Ownership

""A certificate of copyright registration is prima facie evidence of ownership of a valid copyright, but the alleged infringer may
rebut that presumption."" Scholz Design. Inc. v. Sard Custom Homes, LLC , 691 F.3d 182 , 186 (2d Cir. 2012) (citing
MyWebGrocer, LLC v. Hometown Info, Inc. , 375 F.3d 190 , 192 (2d Cir. 2004) ). Here, Cruz has provided a copy of his



--- Page 3 ---
Certificate of Registration for the Photograph. ( See Certificate of Registration.) He has therefore established a prima facie
case that he owns the copyright in the Photograph.

2. Originality

Cox does not dispute either that Cruz has a valid Certificate of Registration or that Cox ""actually copied"" the Photograph. +
Instead, Cox argues that Cruz has failed to establish that the Photograph was sufficiently original to qualify for copyright
protection. (Def. Mem. at 6.)

Copyright protection only extends to "" original works of authorship."" 17 U.S.C. § 102 (emphasis added); see Feist, 499 U.S.
at 345 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 (""[t]he sine qua non of copyright is originality.""). ""Original, as the term is used in copyright, means
only that the work was independently created by the author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses
at least some minimal degree of creativity."" Feist, 499 U.S. at 345 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 (citation omitted). ""A photograph may be
original in three respects: ... rendition ... timing ... [and] creation of the subject."" Mannion v. Coors Brewing Co. , 377 F.
Supp. 2d 444 , 452-54 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) ; see also Rogers v. Koons , 960 F.2d 301 , 307 (2d Cir. 1992) (explaining that the
protectible, original elements of a photograph include ""posing the subjects,

[444 F.Supp.3d 465]

lighting, angle, selection of film and camera, evoking the desired express, and almost any other variant involved."").

As such, ""almost any photograph may claim the necessary originality to support a copyright."" Mannion, 377 F. Supp. 2d at
450 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). However, a photograph may lack originality in rare cases, such as
""where a photograph of a photograph or other printed matter is made that amounts to nothing more than slavish copying.""
Bridgeman Art Library, Ltd. v. Corel Corp. , 36 F. Supp. 2d 191 , 196 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted).

Cox argues that Cruz ""did not make a single creative choice"" in taking the Photograph (Def. Mem. at 9), such that the
Photograph does not possess the ""modicum of creativity"" required to receive copyright protection. ( See id. at 8 (quoting
Feist, 499 U.S. at 346 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 ).) This argument misses the mark. As with almost any photograph, the Photograph
reflects creative choices, including Cruz's timing for when he took the Photograph. See Mannion, 377 F. Supp. 2d at 452 (""
[A] person may create a worthwhile photograph by being at the right place at the right time."") (citation omitted). Indeed,
Cruz's recognition of what he considered a ""big commotion"" (Def. 56.1 § 42), and his decision to take the Photograph when
he did ( i.e. as law enforcement closed in on Saipov after he had been shot and was lying on the ground) were sufficient
creative choices to meet the low threshold required for copyright protection. In addition, the Photograph is not an example of
a""slavish copy"" not entitled to copyright protection. Cf. Bridgeman Art Library. 36 F. Supp. 2d at 197 (finding no copyright in
photographic transparencies that sought to reproduce precisely paintings in the public domain).

Cox points to Oriental Art Printing v. Goldstar Printing Co. ( see, e.g. , Def. Mem. at 11-12) to support its argument, but that
case is readily distinguishable. There, the court found that plaintiffs' photographs of commonly served Chinese food dishes
lacked the ""requisite originality"" to receive copyright protection because they served ""a purely utilitarian purpose"" of giving
customers a ""better understanding of what a particular dish contains"" 175 F. Supp. 2d 542 , 546-47 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). In
addition, the court noted that the aim of the Copyright Act would not be furthered by finding the photographs in question
eligible for copyright protection because such a holding would ""effectively ... permit [plaintiffs] to monopolize the market for
printing menus that depict certain commonly served Chinese dishes."" /d. at 548. Here, by contrast, Cruz's Photograph does
not raise those same concerns. Unlike the photographs in Oriental Art Printing that only served to inform consumers of
Chinese cuisine about their food options, the Photograph at issue here recorded a (manifestly) newsworthy event at a
unique time and from a unique angle.

A holding extending Oriental Art Printing as Cox urges would improperly limit the scope of originality under the Copyright
Act. A recent case in the Southern District of New York, Sands v. CBS Interactive , makes plain why. No. 18-CV-7345 (JSR),
2019 WL 1447014, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2019). In that case, a paparazzo photographed actors on the set of an
upcoming Netflix series The Punisher. Id. The photos were subsequently published alongside an article entitled ""New
Punisher Images Reveal Return of Key Daredevil Character."" /d. While the Sands court had no trouble in finding that the
photographs in question met the low creativity threshold necessary to assert copyright protection, see id. at *3, the result
would

[444 F.Supp.3d 466]

have been different had it extended Oriental Art Printing as Cox urges this court to do now. This is because the Sands
photos (under Cox's reading of Oriental Art Printing ) would be deemed to only serve the purpose of informing the public of
narrative developments in a popular television series, and therefore would lack originality. Yet, such a result would not
comport either with the intent of the Copyright Act or the fact that ""almost any photograph may claim the necessary

originality to support a copyright."" Mannion__377 F. Supp. 2d at 450 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Finally, this case is distinguishable from Oriental Art Printing in another important way. In Oriental Art Printing , the court held


--- Page 4 ---
that finding the photographs in question copyrightable would give plaintiffs an ""unwarranted monopoly"" because it
""effectively would permit them to monopolize the market for printing menus that depict certain commonly served Chinese
dishes."" Oriental Art Printing. 175 F. Supp. 2d at 548 (citation omitted). ""Such a result,"" the court explained ""was not in
Congress' intent in enacting the Copyright Act."" /d. Here, by contrast, there is no such concern of an ""unwarranted
monopoly"" because of the uniqueness of the Photograph and the one-time-only nature of its subject matter.

3. Actual Copying

Once a valid copyright registration is established, ""a plaintiff must show that his work was actually copied and then must
show that the copying amounts to an improper or unlawful appropriation."" Otto v. Hearst Comms., Inc. , 345 F. Supp. 3d
412, 415 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (citation omitted) (alterations adopted). Here, the parties do not dispute that Cox actually copied
the Photograph for use on its website and social media accounts. As such, Cruz has established this element of his
copyright infringement claim.

Accordingly, the court finds that Cox infringed on Cruz's copyright when it published the Photograph. The court therefore
grants Cruz's motion for summary judgment on this issue.

B. Affirmative Defenses

Both Cruz and Cox seek summary judgment on Cox's fair use defense. ( See, e.g. , Pl.'s Mem. at 9; Def Mem. at 15.) Cruz
further seeks summary judgment on Cox's remaining defenses. The court addresses each in turn.

1. Fair Use

The purpose of copyright law is ""[t]lo promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,"" U.S. Const., Art. |, § 8, cl. 8, and
""expand public knowledge and understanding ... by giving potential creators exclusive control over copying of their works,
thus giving them a financial incentive to create informative, intellectually enriching works for public consumption."" Authors
Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 212 (2d Cir. 2015). There are limits, however, on creators’ control over their own
works, including the doctrine of fair use. See Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P., 756 F.3d 73 , 81 (2d Cir.
2014) (""Because copyright law recognizes the need for breathing space, however, a defendant who otherwise would have
violated one or more of these exclusive rights may avoid liability if he can establish that he made fair use of the copyrighted
material."" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).

""[T]he fair use determination is an open-ended and context sensitive inquiry,"" in which the court weighs four non-exclusive
statutorily provided factors in light of the purposes of copyright. Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 705 (2d Cir. 2013)

[444 F.Supp.3d 467]

(citation omitted). These factors are: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the
amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, and (4) the effect of the use
upon the potential market or value of copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107. The Second Circuit has held that the party seeking
a judgment of fair use need not demonstrate that every factor weighs in its favor. See Cariou__ 714 F.3d at 705 . Rather, ""all
factors are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."" Swatch._756 F.3d at 81
(quoting_Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. 510 U.S. 569 , 578,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (alterations
adopted)). Finally, the determination of ""fair use is a mixed question of law and fact,"" Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enters. , 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) , and the Second Circuit has repeatedly ""resolved fair
use determinations at the summary judgment stage where there are no genuine issues of material fact,"" Blanch v. Koons
467 F.3d 244 , 250 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub. Group, Inc. , 150 F.3d 132 , 137 (2d
Cir. 1998) (alterations adopted)).

a. Purpose and Character of the Work

The first statutory fair use factor is ""the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). This first factor, which has been described as ""[t]he
heart of the fair use inquiry,""On Davis v. The Gap, Inc. , 246 F.3d 152 , 174 (2d Cir. 2001), seeks to determine ""whether and
to what extent the work is transformative,"" Campbell__510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Whether a work is transformative depends on the extent to which it ""merely ‘supersedes the objects’ of the original creation,
or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning,
or message."" /d. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting Folsom v. Marsh , 9 F.Cas. 342, 348 (C.C.D. Mass. 1841) (Story, J.)
(citations omitted) (alterations adopted)); see a/so Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard , 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105,
1111 (1990). With regard to photographs, ""[uJsing a photo for the precise reason it was created does not support a finding
that the nature and purpose of the use was fair."" BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, Inc. , 196 F. Supp. 3d 395,
407 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (citation omitted).

oO

While news reporting is specifically named in 17 U.S.C. § 107 as a potential method of fair use, ""a news reporting purpose
by no means guarantees"" such a finding. Swatch, 756 F.3d at 85 (citing Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 557 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ).
The Second Circuit has recognized that ""[i]n the context of news reporting and analogous activities, ... the need to convey



--- Page 5 ---
information to the public accurately may in some instances make it desirable and consonant with copyright law for a
defendant to faithfully reproduce an original work without alteration."" /d. at 84. At the same time, ""[t]he promise of copyright
would be an empty one if it could be avoided merely by dubbing the infringement a fair use ‘news report.’ "" Harper & Row.

471 U.S. at 557 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; see also Swatch._756 F.3d at 85 (""A news organization thus may not freely copy creative
expression solely because the expression itself is newsworthy."").

Applying those standards here, the first factor cuts strongly against Cox. Cox's use of the Photograph was not
transformative, and the court disagrees with Cox that it ""add[ed] context"" to the Photograph

[444 F.Supp.3d 468]
(Def. Mem. at 19) such that its use of the Photograph was fair.

To the extent that Cox argues that its use of the Photograph was fair because ""news reporting is a favored use"" (Def. Mem.
at 16), the court is not persuaded. Cox is correct that 17 U.S.C. § 107 specifically lists news reporting as a potential method
for fair use. Yet Cox forgets that ""[d]isplay of a copyrighted image or video may be transformative where the use serves to
illustrate criticism, commentary, or a news story about that work."" Barcroft Media, Ltd. v. Coed Media Grp., LLC , 297 F.
Supp. 3d 339, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 107 ); see also Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 428 (""[T]he use of an image
solely to illustrate the content of that image, in a commercial capacity, has yet to be found as fair use."").

Here, Cox's Article accompanying the Photograph did not ""serv[e] to illustrate criticism, commentary, or a news story"" about
the Photograph. Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 352. To the contrary, Cox used the Photograph as a ""illustrative aid because
[it] depicted the subjects described in [the] [A]rticl[e],"" namely the arrest of Saipov. /d. ""Nothing in [Cox's] [A]rticle imbues the
[Photograph] with new meaning, or places it in a [new] context."" Gossip Cop , 196 F. Supp. 3d at 406. Indeed, all Cox's
Article says that could conceivably be about the Photograph is that ""[Saipov] was taken into custody""—the vast majority of
the Article, by contrast, concerns Saipov's alleged terrorist acts leading up to his arrest. ( See PI. 56.1 § 19.) To nonetheless
find that Cox's use of the Photograph was fair would ""eliminate copyright protection any time a copyrighted photograph was
used in conjunction with a news story about the subject of that photograph. That is plainly not the law."" Barcroft , 297 F.
Supp. 3d at 352.

Cox relies heavily on Swatch to argue to the contrary, but that case is distinguishable. In Swatch , Bloomberg News
published a recording of Swatch's earnings call, which Swatch had registered with the Copyright Office. 756 F.3d at 79 . The
Second Circuit held that the first fair use factor favored Bloomberg, noting that ""whether one describes Bloomberg's
activities as ‘news reporting,’ ‘data delivery,’ or any other turn of phrase, there can be no doubt that Bloomberg's purpose in
obtaining and disseminating the recording at issue was to make important financial information ... available to investors and
analysts."" /d. at 82. Yet, while publishing Swatch's financial information served ""the important public purpose of
disseminating important financial information,"" id. at 92, Cox's publication of the Photograph serves no such purpose and
conveys no such information. To the contrary, Cox's Article solely uses the Photograph ""for illustrative purposes without
adding new information, new aesthetics, new insights and new understandings."" Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 428 (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, as explained above, it is illustrating just one sentence from the Article—that ""
[Saipov] was taken into custody."" (PI. 56.1 § 19.) The court agrees with Judge Woods' explanation of the danger of adopting
Cox's argument in such a situation:

It would be antithetical to the purposes of copyright protection to allow media companies to steal personal
images and benefit from the fair use defense by simply inserting the photo in an article which only recites factual
information—much of which can be gleaned from the photograph itself. If so, amateur photographers would be
discouraged from creating works and there would be no incentive for publishers to create their own content to
illustrate articles: why pay to create or license photographs if

[444 F.Supp.3d 469]

all personal images posted on social media are free grist for use by media companies, as [Cox] argues here?
Indeed, it seems that this interpretation of the law would hinder the ""Progress of Science and useful Arts,"" and
the creation of ""informative, intellectually enriching works for public consumption.""

Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 428 (citations omitted).
Therefore, because Cox's use of the Photograph was not transformative, the first factor 2 weighs against a finding of fair use.
b. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second factor, which looks to the nature of the copyrighted work, weighs in favor of Cox and a finding of fair use. The
second factor acknowledges that ""some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with the
consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied."" Campbell__ 510 U.S. at 586 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 . In reviewing this factor, courts will determine whether a work is creative versus factual, and unpublished versus
published, with the scope of fair use applying more narrowly to creative and unpublished works. Harper & Row._471 U.S. at
563-64 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . ""The law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or



--- Page 6 ---
antasy."" Id. ; see also Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust , 755 F.3d 87 , 96 (2d Cir. 2014) (""The second factor considers
whether the copyrighted work is of the creative or instructive type that the copyright laws value and seek to foster."" (citation
and internal quotation marks omitted)). In addition, publicly released works qualify for less protection from use by others
han unpublished materials. See Harper & Row. 471 U.S. at 564 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . ""This is because a plaintiff's right to
control the first public appearance of the photo is not implicated in such scenarios, nor does there exist any race to publish,
which lends itself to a finding of fair use."" Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 430 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)
(alterations adopted).

Here, Cruz acknowledges that the Photograph is ""factual in nature"" and was ""published prior to Cox's use"" of it. (PI.'s Mem.
at 16.) The court agrees and finds that the second fair use factor favors Cox. The court also notes, however, that the second
actor is ""rarely found to be determinative"" in the fair use analysis. On Davis, 246 F.3d at 175 .

c. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

The third fair use factor considers whether ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole ... are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Generally speaking, ""the more of a copyrighted work that is taken, the less
likely the use is to be fair.""_Infinity Broad. Corp. v. Kirkwood , 150 F.3d 104 , 109 (2d Cir. 1998).

Here, Cox does not dispute it copied the Photograph in its entirety (Def. Mem. at 21) meaning that, at the very least, this
factor does not favor fair use.

[444 F.Supp.3d 470]

See Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. , 448 F.3d 605 , 613 (2d Cir. 2006) (""Neither our court nor any of our
sister circuits has ever ruled that copying of an entire work favors fair use.""). Cox argues, however, that there was an
""editorial need"" to use the Photograph in its entirety so as to accurately convey the ""important factual information"" in the
Photograph such that the factor should not weigh against fair use either. ( See Def. Mem. at 21-22.)

It is true that using a protected work in its entirety may constitute fair use when the purpose of the use requires it. See Bill
Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 613 ; see also Leval, 103 Harv. L. Rev. at 1123 (""[A]n important inquiry [under the third fair
use factor] is whether the selection and quantity of the material taken are reasonable in relation to the purported
justification.""). Yet, as explained above, Cox's use of the Photograph was not transformative—Cox simply thought
(apparently like its competitors CNN and NBC) that the Photograph had certain qualities that would make it a good
complement to the Article. See Harper & Row. 471 U.S. at 565 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (""[T]he fact that a substantial portion of the
infringing work was copied verbatim is evidence of the qualitative value of the copied material.""). In other words, Cox ""made
no effort to circumscribe its use such that it reproduced only enough of [the Photograph] to satisfy any reporting needs.""
Gossip Cop , 196 F. Supp. 3d at 409. Accordingly, the third factor weighs against fair use.

d. Effect of the Use on the Potential Market

The final fair use factor considers ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" 17
U.S.C. § 107(4). This factor requires the court to investigate whether infringement will affect ""traditional, reasonable, or likely
to be developed market."" Bill Graham Archives. 448 F.3d at 614 (citation omitted). This factor is therefore ""concerned with
secondary uses that, by offering a substitute for the original, usurp a market that properly belongs to the copyright-holder.""
Infinity Broad. Corp.__150 F.3d at 110 ; see also Harper & Row. 471 U.S. at 566-67 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (""Fair use, when
properly applied, is limited to copying by others which does not materially impair the marketability of the work which is
copied."" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Finally, there is a ""close linkage between the first and fourth factors,
in that the more the copying is done to achieve a purpose that differs from the purpose of the original, the less likely it is that
the copy will serve as a satisfactory substitute for the original."" Authors Guild__804 F.3d at 223 (citing Campbell__510 U.S. at
591,114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

This factor weighs against a finding of fair use. The record makes clear that Cruz demonstrated an interest in entering into
the market for the Photograph when he entered into licensing agreements with both CNN and NBC. ( See PI. 56.1 9 11-
13.) As the owner of the Photograph, Cruz had the right to sell the Photograph to media outlets if he so desired; Cox's
publication of the Photograph without Cruz's permission, therefore, ""usurp[ed]"" his market. Infinity Broad. Corp... 150 F.3d at
110 . Cox's reliance on Swatchis again inapposite. In Swatch , the court agreed with the district court's observation that
""nothing in the record suggest[ed] any possible market effect stemming from Bloomberg's use"" of the earnings call
recording, and further noted that ""Swatch had no interest in the exploitation of the copyright-protected aspects of the call.""
Swatch_, 756 F.3d at 91 . Here, by contrast, both those factors—market effect and interest

[444 F.Supp.3d 471]
in exploitation on the part of the copyright holder—are present.

Cox urges that the ""public interest in receiving accurate information regarding [Saipov's] arrest ... outweigh[ed] the personal
gain to Plaintiff of licensing a photo he did not even know was newsworthy until news organizations told him so."" (Def. Mem.


--- Page 7 ---
at 22). First, the fact that a media company would appreciate the importance or newsworthiness of a work before the work's
author is neither relevant to the analysis nor particularly uncommon. See Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 419 (explaining that
plaintiff did not seek compensation for work until media outlet published work without plaintiff's permission). Second, while
Cox is right that there is a direct relationship between the first fair use factor—the purpose and character of the work—and
this factor, that nexus dooms Cox's argument in this case; here, Cox has not demonstrated that its use of the Photograph
was transformative or necessary to convey vital factual information (as opposed to serving as an illustrative aid). If Cox
could simply ""use such images for free, there would be little or no reason to pay for works."" Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 355.
Accordingly, the fourth factor weights against a finding of fair use.

e. The Factors Considered Together

Considering all four factors together, the court finds that Cox's use of the Photograph was not fair. The non-transformative
purpose and manner of Cox's use, the fact that Cox used the Photograph in its entirety, and the harm to Cruz's potential
market for the Photograph outweigh any factual information conveyed by Cox's use. Accordingly, no reasonable trier of fact
could find in favor of Cox on the issue of fair use and Cruz's motion for summary judgment on Cox's fair use defense is
granted.

C. Other Defenses to Liability

Cruz has also moved for summary judgment on Cox's remaining affirmative defenses: (1) failure to state a claim and (2)
First Amendment protection. 2 Cox did not respond to Cruz's arguments on either of these defenses. The court finds that
Cruz has met his burden of demonstrating that no material issue of fact exists on either of these defenses and grants Cruz's
motion as to both.

As to the First Amendment defense, the Second Circuit has held that ""the fair use doctrine encompasses all claims of first
amendment in the copyright field."" New Era Pubs. Int'l, ApS v. Henry Holt & Co.__873 F.2d 576 , 584 (2d Cir. 1989) ;see
also Nihon Keizai Shimbun v. Comline Bus. Data, Inc. , 166 F.3d 65 , 74 (2d Cir. 1999) (""First Amendment concerns are
protected by and coextensive with the fair use doctrine.""). Therefore, because the court has granted Cruz's summary
judgment motion on Cox's fair use defense, the court also grants judgment in favor of Cruz on Cox's First Amendment
defense.

As to Cox's defense that Cruz fails to state a claim, that is clearly not the case here. A complaint must plead ""enough facts
to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 , 570,127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167

L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) . ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.""

[444 F.Supp.3d 472]

Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) . Here, Cruz has provided sufficient
information in his complaint such that the court can draw the ""reasonable inference"" that Cox is liable for copyright
infringement. Therefore, the court grants judgment in favor of Cruz as to Cox's defense of failure to state a claim.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Cruz's motion for partial summary judgment (Dkt. 28) is GRANTED as to Cox's liability for
copyright infringement and Cox's assertion of its affirmative defenses, including fair use. Cox's cross motion for partial
summary judgment (Dkt. 34) is DENIED as to the issue of copyright infringement and fair use.

The parties are DIRECTED to contact Magistrate Judge Tomlinson regarding next steps in this case.
SO ORDERED.

2Under the first fair use factor, courts also consider the commercial nature of the secondary use of the copyrighted material. However, courts ""do not
place much significance"" on the commercial nature of the secondary use if the use is not transformative. Cariou__714 F.3d at 708 . Here, there is no
doubt that Cox is a commercial enterprise ( see, e.g. , PI. 56.1 § 20; Def. Mem. at 19), but, because Cox's use was not transformative, its commercial
nature is of much less importance to the analysis under the first fair use factor.

3 By joint stipulation, Cox agreed to dismiss the following affirmative defenses: personal jurisdiction, license, safe harbor under the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512 ), acquiescence, equitable estoppel, and waiver. ( See Jan. 15, 2019 Joint Stip. & Order re: Dismissal of Certain
Affirmative Defenses.)

PREGERSON, Circuit Judge.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department purchased 3,663 licenses to Wall Data's computer software, ' but
installed the software onto 6,007 computers. We are asked to determine whether the Sheriff's Department's conduct
constituted copyright infringement. The wrinkle in

Page 774

this otherwise smooth question is that, although the software was installed onto 6,007 computers, the computers were
configured such that the total number of workstations able to access the installed software did not exceed the total number
of licenses the Sheriff's Department purchased. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and hold that such copying
constitutes copyright infringement despite the Sheriff's Department's configuration. We therefore affirm the district court.

|. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Plaintiff-Appellee Wall Data Incorporated develops, markets, and sells a line of copyrighted computer terminal
emulation software products including RUMBA Office and RUMBA Mainframe. Both RUMBA products allow personal
computers that use one operating system to access data stored on computers that use a different operating system. RUMBA
Office is the more expensive and more powerful computer program.

Between December 1996 and February 1999, the Appellants-Defendants, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
and the County of Los Angeles (collectively, ""Sheriff's Department""), purchased both of Wall Data's RUMBA software
products through an approved vendor. In December 1996, the Sheriff's Department purchased eight ""units"" of Wall Data's
RUMBA Office program. Each of the eight units contained a RUMBA Office CD-ROM (compact disc read-only-memory) and
a volume license booklet. Each volume license booklet granted the Sheriff's Department 250 licenses to RUMBA Office. In
total, the Sheriff's Department paid $175,220 for 2,000 RUMBA Office licenses, at a reduced price of $87.61 per license. 2

Between November 1997 and February 1999, the Sheriffs Department purchased 1,628 licenses to the lower-cost
RUMBA Mainframe program. In all, the Sheriffs Department purchased 2,035 licenses to RUMBA Office and 1,628 licenses
to RUMBA Mainframe, for a total of 3,663 licenses.

At first, the Sheriff's Department installed RUMBA Office manually, one computer at a time, onto approximately 750
computers in the Sheriff's Department's new detention facility — the Twin Towers Correctional Facility (""Twin Towers""). The
Sheriff's Department soon realized that this process was too time consuming and would delay opening the Twin Towers. In


--- Page 2 ---
addition, it was not clear where those employees who would need to use RUMBA programs would be assigned to work. To
speed up the process of installation and to ensure that employees would be able to use the RUMBA software regardless of
where they were assigned, the Sheriff's Department decided to install a ""baseline"" of software applications onto the hard
drives of the remaining computers in its new detention facility. This was done by simultaneously copying the entire contents
of a single ""master"" hard drive containing the baseline of software applications onto the hard drives of other computers. This
method is known as ""hard disk imaging,"" and saved the Sheriff's Department from having to install the software manually
onto each computer.

By the time the Sheriff's Department finished hard disk imaging in mid-2001, RUMBA Office was loaded onto 6,007
computers

Page 775

in the Twin Towers, far in excess of the 3,663 RUMBA licenses the Sheriff's Department had purchased. Although RUMBA
Office was installed onto nearly all of the computers in the Twin Towers, the Sheriffs Department configured those
computers using a password-based security system such that the number of users who could access RUMBA Office was
limited. The Sheriffs Department claims that, at all times, the number of those who could access the software was limited to
the number of licenses it had. °

Shortly thereafter, Wall Data discovered that the number of computers in the Twin Towers that had RUMBA Office
installed exceeded the number of licenses held by the Sheriff's Department. As a result, Wall Data claimed that the Sheriff's
Department violated the terms of its licenses because the Sheriff's Department was licensed, at most, to install RUMBA
software onto only 3,663 computers.

The parties tried unsuccessfully to settle the dispute. After settlement efforts failed, the Sheriff's Department removed
RUMBA Office from the computers in the Twin Towers for which it did not have a license. The Sheriff's Department installed
the less expensive RUMBA Mainframe program onto many computers to replace the copies of RUMBA Office that were
removed.

On January 11, 2002, Wall Data filed suit against the Sheriff's Department. Although Wall Data raised several claims in
its complaint, the only claim that went to trial (and the only claim at issue here) was copyright infringement. Wall Data
alleged that the Sheriff's Department ""over-installed"" RUMBA Office onto computers in the Twin Towers and violated the
terms of Wall Data's shrink-wrap license, 4 click-through license, 5 and volume license booklets.

Page 776

In response, the Sheriffs Department contended that it had not violated the terms of Wall Data's licenses and that it
was entitled to the following affirmative defenses: (1) a ""fair use"" defense under 17 U.S.C. § 107; and (2) an ""essential step""
defense under 17 U.S.C. § 117(a)(1). As described above, the Sheriff's Department argued that, even though it had installed
RUMBA Office onto 6,007 workstations, it had configured the software so that the software could only be accessed by 3,663
workstations at a time. The Sheriff's Department argued that this constituted a fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107 because the
number of ""useable"" copies of the software did not exceed the number of licenses held by the Sheriffs Department. The
Sheriff's Department also argued that the copying was an ""essential step"" under 17 U.S.C. § 117(a)(/), because the hard
drive imaging process was a necessary step of installation. Based on these arguments and affirmative defenses, both
parties moved for summary judgment.

The district court made its initial ruling on the parties' summary judgment motions on May 2, 2003, and concluded that
neither party was entitled to summary judgment. On May 15, 2003, both sides filed numerous motions in limine. The district
court ruled on these motions on June 17, 2003; it excluded evidence offered by the Sheriff's Department on its fair use
defense, and other evidence that the district court ruled irrelevant, time consuming, or confusing to the jury. On the same
day, the district court reconsidered its earlier ruling on summary judgment, and granted Wall Data's motion for summary
judgment on the basis that the Sheriff's Department was not entitled to a fair use defense.

Following these rulings on the parties' motions in limine, a four-day jury trial took place. The only issues remaining for
trial were whether the Sheriff's Department had infringed on Wall Data's copyright and whether any defense barred Wall
Data's copyright infringement claim. At the end of trial, the jury returned a general verdict finding the Sheriff's Department
liable for copyright infringement and awarding Wall Data $210,000 in damages. Subsequently, Wall Data filed a motion
under 17 U.S.C. § 505 requesting over $1.5 million in attorneys' fees and nearly $150,000 in costs. The district court granted
Wall Data $516,271 in attorneys' fees and approximately $38,000 in costs. After the district court entered final judgment
against the Sheriff's Department, the Sheriff's Department timely appealed.

The Sheriffs Department now challenges (1) the district court's order granting summary judgment against its § 107 fair
use defense; (2) the district court's evidentiary rulings on motions in limine including those affecting its § 107 fair use

defense and § 117 essential step defense; (3) the district court's jury instructions regarding, inter alia, the Sheriff's
Department's § 117 essential step defense; and (4) the district court's order granting Wall Data costs and attorneys' fees.

I. ANALYSIS

The 1976 Copyright Act defines a ""computer program"" as ""a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or
indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result."" 17 U.S.C. § 101. We have long held that a computer


--- Page 3 ---
program is copyrightable as a ""tangible medium of expression."" Apple Computer,
Page 777

Inc. v. Formula Int'l, Inc., 725 F.2d 521 , 524-25 (9th Cir.1984).

As the owner of a copyright, Wall Data has exclusive rights in its copyrighted work. See 17 U.S.C. § 106. Exemptions,
compulsory licenses, and defenses found in the Copyright Act narrow Wall Data's rights as a copyright owner. See id. at §§
107-122. Here, the Sheriffs Department claims that two defenses found in the Copyright Act apply: the § 107 fair use
defense and the § 117 essential step defense. As discussed below, we hold that neither of these defenses save the Sheriff's
Department from liability to Wall Data for copyright infringement, and we affirm the district court in full.

A. The Sheriff's Department Is Not Entitled to a § 107 Fair Use Defense

For more than a century, courts have excused certain otherwise infringing uses of copyrighted works under the fair use
doctrine. See Folsom v. Marsh, 9 F. Cas. 342 (C.C.D.Mass.1841); Horace G. Ball, The Law of Copyright and Literary
Property 260 (1944). The Copyright Act codified the fair use defense and identified six examples of fair uses: ""criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research."" 17 U.S.C. §
107. The fair use defense buttresses the basic goal of copyright law: to put copyrighted works to their most beneficial use so
that ""the public good fully coincides ... with the claims of individuals."" The Federalist No. 43, at 267 (J. Madison) (New
American Library ed.1961) (1788); see also Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 480 n. 33,104
S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (""[W]e must take care to guard against two extremes equally prejudicial; the one, that
men of ability, who have employed their time for the service of the community, may not be deprived of their just merits, and
the reward of their ingenuity and labour; the other, that the world may not be deprived of improvements, nor the progress of
the arts be retarded."") (quoting Sayre v. Moore, 1 East 361 n.(b), 102 Eng. Rep. 139, 140 n.(b) (K.B.1785)); Mattel, Inc. v.
Walking Mountain Prod., 353 F.3d 792 , 799 (9th Cir.2003) (""At its core, the Act seeks to promote the progress of science
and art by protecting artistic and scientific works while encouraging the development and evolution of new works.""); Dr.
Seuss Enters., L.P. v. Penguin Books USA, Inc., 109 F.3d 1394 , 1399 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that fair use ""permits courts to
avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed
to foster"") (citing_lowa State Univ. Research Found., Inc. v. Am. Broad. Cos., 621 F.2d 57 , 60 (2d Cir.1980)).

In this case, the district court granted summary judgment against the Sheriff's Department on its fair use defense. We
review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment._See Smith v. Jackson, 84 F.3d 1213 , 1218 (9th Cir.1996).
We also review de novo the district court's finding of fair use under the Copyright Act, a mixed question of law and fact. See
Mattel, 353 F.3d at 799 .

1. The Four Fair Use Factors

To determine whether the Sheriff's Department's use was fair, we must balance four factors. See id. at 800. These
factors are: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential

Page 778
market for or value of the copyrighted work. See Dr. Seuss, 109 F.3d at 1399-1404 .

Not all of the four factors must favor the Sheriff's Department. See Sega Enters. Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 ,
1522 (9th Cir.1992). As we balance these factors, we bear in mind that fair use is appropriate where a ""reasonable copyright
owner"" would have consented to the use, i.e., where the ""custom or public policy"" at the time would have defined the use as
reasonable. Subcomm. on Patents, Trademarks & Copyrights of the Sen. Comm. on the Judiciary, 86th Cong., 2d Sess.,
Study No. 14, Fair Use of Copyrighted Works 15 (Latman) (Comm. Print 1960).

2. Balancing of the Four Fair Use Factors

The Sheriff's Department claims that it is entitled to a fair use defense, because it has done nothing more than apply
technology to make the broadest authorized use of its licenses. We are mindful that fair use is a tool for adapting copyright
law to brisk technological advances and for tempering the over-technical application of copyright law. Nonetheless, in re-
weighing the four fair use factors on appeal, ""in light of the purposes of copyright,""Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510
U.S. 569 , 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) , we conclude that the Sheriff's Department is not entitled to the
fair use defense. See Los Angeles News Serv. v. CBS Broad., Inc., 305 F.3d 924 , 942, as amended,_313 F.3d 1093 (9th
Cir.2002) (""As fair use is a mixed question of fact and law, so long as the record is ‘sufficient to evaluate each of the
statutory factors,’ we may reweigh on appeal the inferences to be drawn from that record."") (quoting Harper & Row, Inc. v.
Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) ).

a. First Fair Use Factor: Purpose and Character of the Allegedly Infringing Use

We first consider the nature of the work: whether the new work is transformative or simply supplants the original work,


--- Page 4 ---
and whether the work is commercial in nature. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164.

Of primary concern is whether the Sheriff's Department's use was transformative; the more ""transformative the new
work, the less will be the significance of the other factors."" /d. A use is considered transformative only where a defendant
changes a plaintiff's copyrighted work or uses the plaintiff's copyrighted work in a different context such that the plaintiff's
work is transformed into a new creation. See, e.g., id. at 578-79, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The Sheriffs Department created exact
copies of RUMBA's software. It then put those copies to the identical purpose as the original software. Such a use cannot be
considered transformative. See Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811 , 819 (9th Cir.2003) (finding that reproducing music
CDs in computer MP3 format is not a transformative use because the resulting use of the copyrighted work was the same as
the original use, i.e., entertainment). In cases where ""use is for the same intrinsic purpose as[the copyright holder's] ... such
use seriously weakens a claimed fair use."""" Worldwide Church of God v. Philadelphia Church of God. Inc., 227 F.3d 1110 ,
1117 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting Weissmann v. Freeman, 868 F.2d 1313 , 1324 (2d Cir.1989)).

Next, the Sheriff's Department's use of hard drive imaging to copy RUMBA Office did not promote the advancement of
knowledge and the arts — goals that copyright intends to secure. ""[C]opyright law ultimately serves the purpose of enriching

Page 779

the general public through access to creative works,"" Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc.,510 U.S. 517 , 527,114 S.Ct. 1023 , 127
L.Ed.2d 455 (1994) . But the Sheriff's Department did not ""provide the marketplace with new creative works,"" nor was there
any advancement of public knowledge in this case._Triad Sys. Corp. v. Southeastern Express Co., 64 F.3d 1330 , 1336 (9th
Cir. 1995). Thus, allowing such a ""fair use"" would not further the ultimate goals of copyright law.

Finally, the Sheriffs Department use was commercial in nature. The Sheriff's Department alleges that its use was
""commercially insignificant"" because not all of the copies of Wall Data's computer software were actually used, and because
the Sheriff's Department is a government agency that does not compete with Wall Data. We disagree. As we explained in
Worldwide Church of God, ""repeated and exploitative copying of copyrighted works, even if the copies are not offered for
sale, may constitute a commercial use."" 227 F.3d at 1118 . A commercial use ""is demonstrated by a showing that repeated
and exploitative unauthorized copies of copyrighted works were made to save the expense of purchasing authorized
copies."" A & M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 , 1015 (9th Cir.2001); see also Worldwide Church of God, 227
F.3d at 1118 (concluding that a user is ""commercial"" where the infringer profited from its infringement because ""it gained an
‘advantage’ or ‘benefit' from its distribution and use of [the plaintiff's product] without having to account to the copyright
holder"").

The terms of Wall Data's RUMBA license clearly restricted the Sheriff's Department's use to a ""single designated
computer"" and prohibited the Sheriff's Department from using ""the Software in any other multiple computer or multiple user
arrangement."" Despite this condition, the Sheriff's Department loaded an entire suite of software, including RUMBA Office,
onto nearly all of the computers in the Twin Towers. By using hard drive imaging, the Sheriff's Department saved man-hours
and eliminated possible errors associated with separately installing the individual software packages onto each computer in
the Twin Tower facility. Hard drive imaging also ensured that those users who needed to use RUMBA would be able to
access the software at whatever computer they were assigned to work. Such flexibility could only have been achieved by
purchasing licenses for each of the computers on which the software was loaded, or by negotiating with Wall Data for a less
restrictive license. Accordingly, we conclude that ""the purpose and character"" of the Sheriff's Department's use was
commercial, because the copies ""were made to save the expense of purchasing authorized copies,"" Napster,_239 F.3d at
1015 , or at least the expense of purchasing a more flexible license. Thus, the district court did not err when it decided that
the Sheriff's Department's use was not ""for a legitimate, essentially non-exploitative purpose,"" and that the commercial
aspect of the Sheriff's Department's use was not ""of minimal significance."" Sega,977 F.2d at 1522-23 . 6

The Sheriff's Department's installation of the RUMBA Office software onto nearly
Page 780

all of its computers in the Twin Towers was not transformative, did not promote an advancement of the arts, and was
commercial in nature. The first factor therefore weighs against a finding of fair use.

b. Second Fair Use Factor: Nature of the Copyrighted Work

In analyzing the second fair use factor, we look at the nature of the copyrighted work, creative works being ""closer to
the core of intended copyright protection’ than informational and functional works."" Dr. Seuss,109 F.3d at 1402 (quoting
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). Our sister circuits have also considered, under this factor, whether the
copyrighted work represents ""substantial investment of time and labor ... in anticipation of a financial return."" MCA, Inc. v.
Wilson, 677 F.2d 180 , 182 (2d Cir.1981). Although the RUMBA software products are not purely creative works, copyright
law nonetheless protects computer software. See Sega,_977 F.2d at 1519 (""[T]he 1980 amendments to the Copyright Act
unambiguously extended copyright protection to computer programs.""). In addition, Wall Data presented undisputed
evidence that RUMBA software products were developed over several years, and required a multi-million dollar investment
on Wall Data's part. We therefore conclude that the nature of the copyrighted work weighs against a finding of fair use.

c. Third Fair Use Factor: Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used


--- Page 5 ---
Next, we consider whether the ""amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyright work as a
whole,"" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3), is ""reasonable in relation to the purpose of copying,"" Dr. Seuss, 109 F.3d at 1402 . The Sheriff's
Department copied RUMBA Office in its entirety to ensure that all of the computers in the Twin Towers had identical copies
of the software. And although ""entire verbatim reproductions are justifiable where the purpose of the work differs from the
original,"" Mattel, 353 F.3d at 804 , the Sheriff's Department put its copies to the exact purpose for which the original software
licenses were purchased. Consequently, the Sheriff Department's ""verbatim"" copying of the entire copyrighted work also
weighs against a finding of fair use. See Worldwide Church of God,_227 F.3d at 1118 (""While wholesale copying does not
preclude fair use per se, copying an entire work militates against a finding of fair use."") (internal quotation marks omitted).

d. Fourth Fair Use Factor: Effect of the Use Upon the Potential Market

In addressing the final fair use factor, we focus on ""the normal market for the copyrighted work"" and whether the
allegedly infringing use threatens the potential market for, or value of, a copyrighted work. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at
568 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (noting that the fourth fair use factor is concerned with ""use that supplants any part of the normal
market for a copyrighted work"") (quoting S.Rep. No. 473, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 65 (1975)). We have said:

[t]his inquiry attempts to strike a balance between the benefit the public will derive if the use is permitted and the
personal gain the copyright owner will receive if the use is denied. The less adverse effect that an alleged infringing use has
on the copyright owner's expectation of gain, the less public benefit need be shown to justify the use.

Mattel_353 F.3d at 804-05 .
The Sheriff's Department contends that its copying was solely an attempt to use efficiently its licensed copies
Page 781

of the RUMBA software products, and accordingly, there was no negative impact on Wall Data's market. It points to its own
statements that it would not have purchased additional copies of the license had it known that its configuration went beyond
its license. We are not persuaded. The Sheriff's Department bought a few licenses and found a way to install the program
onto all of its computers without paying the fee required for each installation. The Sheriff's Department could have bargained
for the flexibility it desired, but it did not. Whenever a user puts copyrighted software to uses beyond the uses it bargained
for, it affects the legitimate market for the product. Thus, although hard drive imaging might be an efficient and effective way
to install computer software, we conclude that ""unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the
defendant"" would nonetheless lead to over-use of the software. Campbell,_510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting 3
Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 13.05[A](4), at 13-102.61 (1993)).

Equally important, ghost copies of the software lay dormant and were unuseable only untila Sheriff's Department
network administrator decided to activate RUMBA Office on that computer. The Sheriffs Department thus created its own
""sub-licensing"" system where it granted users permission to use the software and, in essence, asked Wall Data to ""trust""
that it was not using RUMBA in excess of its authorization under the license. We recognize that computer licensing is
generally an ""honor system,"" in that there is little to stop a person with physical possession of software from installing it on
multiple computers. But in this case, the Sheriffs Department's system made tracking infringement almost impossible,
because Wall Data could not independently verify which of the computers had been used to access RUMBA and which ones
had not — it had to trust the Sheriff's Department that its system was not allowing over-use. In fact, after Wall Data brought
the over-use of RUMBA to the Sheriff's Department's attention, a Sheriff's Department employee admitted, in an email, that
he was not sure how to tell which computers had accessed RUMBA. ’ This system therefore made copyright infringement
easier (because no physical installation was necessary) and made detection of over-use more difficult.

In recognition of the ease with which software can be over-used, courts have been cautious to extend protection to
methods that would make copyright infringement of software any easier:

Software fundamentally differs from more traditional forms of medium, such as print or phonographic materials, in that
software can be both, more readily and easily copied on a mass scale in an extraordinarily short amount of time and
relatively inexpensively. One of the primary advantages of software, its ability to record, concentrate and convey information
with unprecedented ease and speed, makes it extraordinarily vulnerable to illegal copying and piracy. [Thus,] it is important
to acknowledge these special characteristics of the software industry and provide enhanced copyright protection for its
inventors and developers.

Adobe Sys., Inc. v. Stargate Software Inc..216 F.Supp.2d 1051 , 1059 (N.D.Cal.2002). We believe that ""widespread
use"" of hard drive imaging in excess of one's licenses

Page 782

could seriously impact the market for Wall Data's product. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citations
omitted). Therefore, we conclude that the fourth factor also weighs against a finding of fair use.

--- Page 6 ---
substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the plaintiffs' market — none militate in favor of the Sheriff's
Department's fair use defense. We therefore hold that the Sheriff's Department is not entitled to a fair use defense, and we
affirm the district court's order granting summary judgment on the Sheriff's Department's fair use defense.

B. The District Court's Evidentiary Rulings Were Not Erroneous

We review a district court's evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. See Columbia Pictures Television, Inc. v.
Krypton Broad. of Birmingham, Inc., 259 F.3d 1186 , 1195 (9th Cir.2001). Prejudice must be shown to warrant a reversal.

See id. As explained below, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled against the Sheriff's Department on
the admissibility of certain evidentiary matters.

1. Exclusion of Irrelevant Evidence

The district court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled against the Sheriffs Department on the admissibility of the
following evidence: (1) excerpts from Wall Data's 10k report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""); (2) the
Sheriff's Department's Master Vendor Agreements; and (3) evidence regarding Wall Data's communications with other
customers and its instructions to its sales personnel describing RUMBA software licenses. We agree with the district court
that the evidence offered by the Sheriff's Department was irrelevant, would have consumed an unreasonable amount of
time, would have caused jury confusion, or would have unduly prejudiced Wall Data. See Fed.R.Evid. 401, 402, 403. In any
event, we find that any error in excluding the evidence was harmless.

First, the district court did not err when it excluded from evidence an excerpt from Wall Data's 10k report to the SEC.
The relevant excerpt consisted of a general statement that Wall Data's shrink-wrap licenses ""may be unenforceable."" Such
licenses were clearly enforceable in California and Washington, the relevant jurisdictions in these actions. See, e.g., Lozano
v. AT & T Wireless, 216 F.Supp.2d 1071 , 1073 (C.D.Cal.2002); M.A. Mortenson Co. v. Timberline Software Corp.. 140
Wash.2d 568 , 998 P.2d 305 , 313 (2000). The 10k report was irrelevant because it did not deal specifically with the action at
hand. Therefore, the district court's decision to exclude such evidence was not an abuse of discretion.

Next, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded evidence of Master Vendor Agreements governing
the Sheriff's Department's purchase of software. The Sheriff's Department ordered RUMBA software products through one
of the Sheriff's Department's resellers, an approved Los Angeles County vendor, who in turn, ordered the products from a
Wall Data distributor. The Master Vendor Agreements governed the relationship between the Sheriff's Department and the
reseller, not the relationship between the Sheriff's Department and Wall Data. Because Wall Data was not a party to the
Master Vendor Agreements, the district court ruled that the Sheriff's Department could

Page 783

only introduce such documents for purposes of estoppel if the Sheriff's Department could prove that Wall Data had
knowledge of them. The Sheriff's Department conceded that it had no evidence that Wall Data knew of the agreements.
Because Wall Data had no knowledge of the agreements, we agree with the district court that the Master Vendor
Agreements were not binding on Wall Data and were therefore irrelevant to the proceeding. We thus conclude that the
district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the Master Vendor Agreements.

The district court properly excluded evidence related to Wall Data's communications with other customers and
existence of another Wall Data software product, CYBERPRISE. We agree with the district court that Wall Data's
communication with other customers regarding licenses for the products they purchased was irrelevant to the case at hand.
The court also acted properly when it excluded all evidence related to CYBERPRISE. Unlike RUMBA, which was designed
to be installed on physical workstations, CYBERPRISE was accessed through the internet. CYBERPRISE was also licensed
under a concurrent user licensing system, which made the physical location of the user irrelevant. ® Because there were
clear difference between the two products, information about CYBERPRISE would distract the jury from the relevant issues
in this case. Accordingly, the district court did not err in excluding evidence relating to CYBERPRISE.

Finally, the district court decision to exclude Wall Data's instructions to sales personnel describing RUMBA software
licenses was not reversible error. The licenses clearly state that reliance should not be placed on representations made by
Wall Data employees. In addition, even though the district court granted a motion in limine excluding this evidence, the
Sheriff's Department nonetheless introduced testimony regarding conversations between its employees and Wall Data
employees. The Sheriff's Department did not point to any evidence that they were prevented from offering because of the
district court's ruling. The Sheriff's Department has not shown any prejudice based on the district court's ruling on the motion
in limine, and therefore any error was harmless.

The district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the above evidence would confuse or mislead the jury.
Accordingly, the district court's evidentiary rulings on these points are affirmed.

2. Admission of the Sheriff's Department's Internal Memorandum

Before trial, the district court ruled that internal Sheriff's Department communications concerning settlement
negotiations between Wall Data and the Sheriff's Department would be excluded. The district court later allowed Wall Data
to introduce an internal memorandum dated March 23, 2001, prepared by a Sheriff's Department employee related to the
dispute. In the memorandum, a Sheriff's Department employee admitted that he ""did not know how to tell which [computers]
RUMBA is used on and on which ones it has never been used."" The Sheriff's Department objected on the basis that the


--- Page 7 ---
Page 784

memorandum was prepared in aid of settlement discussions. The district court overruled the Sheriff's Department's
objection and allowed Wall Data to introduce the document.

On appeal, the Sheriff's Department claims that admission of the document constitutes reversible error because the
memorandum was prepared in aid of settlement discussions. Not so. The district court properly determined that the parties’
settlement discussions did not crystallize until March 29, 2001, almost a week after this memorandum was written. This
memorandum merely recounted a meeting between Sheriff's Department employees and Wall Data to discuss possible
over-use of the RUMBA licenses. Because the memorandum did not contain evidence ""furnishing or offering or promising to
furnish ... valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either
validity or amount,"" Fed.R.Evid. 408, and because the memorandum was written before settlement discussions began,
admission of the memorandum by the district court did not constitute reversible error.

C. The District Court's Jury Instructions Were Not Erroneous

We review de novo whether a jury instruction misstates the law. See White v. Ford Motor Co., 312 F.3d 998 , 1012 (9th
Cir.2002). We review a district court's formulation of civil jury instructions for an abuse of discretion. See Monroe v. City of
Phoenix, 248 F.3d 851 , 857 (9th Cir.2001). An error in instructing the jury in a civil case does not require reversal if that
error is harmless. See id. at 860. The district court concluded that many of the parties' proposed jury instructions were
""slanted or argumentative one way or the other"" and ""were not appropriate or were confusing to the jury."" For this reason,
the district court fashioned jury instructions for the parties. As discussed below, the district court's jury instructions fairly and
adequately covered the issues presented, correctly stated the law, and were not misleading. See Duran v. City of Maywood,
221 F.3d 1127 , 1130 (9th Cir.2000).

1. Jury Instructions Related to the Essential Step Defense Under 17 U.S.C. § 117 Were Not Erroneous

The Sheriffs Department requested that the district court instruct the jury on the difference between a ""licensee"" and an
""owner"" for purposes of a § 117 ""essential step"" defense. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion
when it declined to do so.

The essential step defense attempts to strike a balance between the interests of software users and software
developers. See 17 U.S.C. § 117. This section permits the owner of a copy of a copyrighted computer program to make (or
authorize the making of) another copy of the program, if the copy is created as an ""essential step in the utilization of the
computer program in connection with the [computer, and] is used in no other manner."" /d. The ""essential step"" defense also
ensures that a software user does not infringe when the user ""copies"" the software from the computer's permanent storage
(the hard drive, for example) onto its active memory (the random access memory, for example). Section 117 also allows the
owner to make a copy of the computer program if the copy is ""for archival purposes only and ... all archival copies are
destroyed in the event that continued possession of the computer program should cease to be rightful."" /d.

Section 117, by its own terms, applies only to ""the owner of a copy of the computer program."" 17 U.S.C. § 117
(emphasis added). In the leading case on

Page 785

ownership under § 117, we considered an agreement in which MAI, the owner of a software copyright, transferred copies of
the copyrighted software to Peak under an agreement that imposed severe restrictions on Peak's rights with respect to
those copies. See MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir.1993) . We held that Peak was a licensee
and not an owner of the copies of the software for purposes of § 117 and consequently did not enjoy the rights conferred on
""owners"" under that statute. See id. at 518 n. 5. Thus, under MAI, if a software developer retains ownership of every copy of
software, and merely licenses the use of those copies, § 117 does not apply.

Here, we conclude that the Sheriff's Department received licenses to the RUMBA software. Generally, if the copyright
owner makes it clear that she or he is granting only a license to the copy of software and imposes significant restrictions on
the purchaser's ability to redistribute or transfer that copy, the purchaser is considered a licensee, not an owner, of the
software. In this case, as in MAI, the licensing agreement imposed severe restrictions on the Sheriff's Department's rights
with respect to the software. Such restrictions would not be imposed on a party who owned the software. The Sheriff's
Department's use of and rights to the RUMBA software products were restricted under the terms of the click-through and
volume booklet licenses. These restrictions were sufficient to classify the transaction as a grant of license to Wall Data's
software, and not a sale of Wall Data's software. For these reasons, under MAI, the Sheriff's Department is not the ""owner""
of copies of Wall Data's software for purposes of § 117.

Even if we were to accept that the Sheriffts Department was the ""owner of copies"" of RUMBA for § 117 purposes, 9 the
Sheriff's Department's conduct was not an ""essential step,"" and therefore any error in instruction was harmless. The Sheriff's
Department argued that ""it was inherently necessary to copy the entire RUMBA package onto hard drives, albeit within the
constraints of a security system that made the challenged copies unusable."" This argument is unpersuasive. Substantial
evidence demonstrates that the Sheriffs Department's decision to copy the RUMBA software products was not an essential


--- Page 8 ---
step, but a matter of convenience. It copied the software onto 75 computers without the aid of hard drive imaging, and
switched to hard drive imaging because its deadline in opening Twin Towers loomed large, not because manual installation
had become more difficult. Even under time pressure, there was no need for the Sheriff's Department to copy

Page 786

the RUMBA Office software onto the hard drives of nearly all of its Twin Towers computers. Instead, the Sheriff's
Department could have used hard drive imaging to install RUMBA software onto the number of computers for which it had
licenses. Its decision not to do so was an effort to save time and preserve flexibility, and was not a necessity. We conclude
that the essential step defense was not intended to cover such situations. Consequently, any failure by the district court to
instruct the jury on the distinction between an owner and a licensee was harmless.

2. The District Court's Refusal to Instruct the Jury on Rules of Contract Formation

The district court ruled that the click-through, shrink-wrap, and volume booklet licenses constituted the operative
contracts, and declined to instruct the jury on the rules of contract formation and construction, as suggested by the Sheriff's
Department. Because contract formation and interpretation are questions of law for the court to determine, see /n re
Bennett, 298 F.3d 1059 , 1064 (9th Cir.2002), the district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to instruct the
jury as to formation and construction of a contract. Moreover, because the sole issue to be resolved at trial was whether the
Sheriff's Department violated the terms of Wall Data's licenses, instructions related to contract formation and interpretation
were unnecessary.

3. Jury Instructions Regarding Damages
The district court gave the following jury instructions related to damages:

Damage means the amount of money which will reasonably and fairly compensate Wall Data for any injury you find
was caused by the Los Angeles sheriff's department.... Your award must be based on evidence and not speculation,
guesswork, or conjecture.... Actual damages means the amount of money to adequately compensate the copyright owner
for the reduction of the market value of the copyrighted work caused by the infringement. The reduction of the market value
of the copyrighted work is the amount a willing buyer would have been reasonably required to pay a willing seller at the time
of the infringement for the actual use made by the Los Angeles Sheriff's department of the plaintiffts work. That amount also
could be represented by the lost license fees Wall Data would have received for the unauthorized copies.

We conclude that such instructions properly state the law of damages in a copyright infringement suit. ""Actual damages
are usually determined by the loss in the fair market value of the copyright, measured by the profits lost due to the

infringement or by the value of the use of the copyrighted work to the infringer."" Polar Bear Prods.. Inc. v. Timex Corp., 384

F.3d 700 , 708 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting McRoberts Software, Inc. v. Media 100, Inc.,.329 F.3d 557 , 566 (7th Cir.2003)). ""[I]t is
not improper for a jury to consider either a hypothetical lost license fee or the value of the infringing use to the infringer to

determine actual damages, provided the amount is not based on ‘undue speculation."" /d. at 709 (quoting McRoberts

Software, 329 F.3d at 566 ). The district court properly instructed the jury in line with our circuit's caselaw, and accordingly
this instruction was proper.

Moreover, the jury's finding was appropriate and was not speculative, and therefore any error was harmless.
Specifically, the jury heard testimony from Wall Data's vice president that the average price Wall Data charged the vendor
that

Page 787

sold software to the Sheriff's Department was $189. She admitted on cross-examination that government entities were
charged $113 per copy. The jury returned a general verdict awarding Wall Data damages of $210,000. It is not clear how
the jury calculated this award: At one extreme, if the jury found that the Sheriff's Department infringed on 2,344 copies
(6,007 computers — 3,663 total RUMBA Office and RUMBA Mainframe licenses), the award was approximately $90 per
copy. At the other extreme, if the jury found that the Sheriff's Department infringed on 3,962 copies (6,007 computers —
2035 RUMBA Office licenses), the award was $53 per copy. Either way, these amounts were within an acceptable range —
$85 original price paid by the Sheriffs Department and $189 average price. Because ""the jury's verdict[] find[s] substantial
support in the record and lie[s] within the range sustainable by the proof,"" any error in instruction was harmless. Los Angeles
Mem'! Coliseum Comm'n v. Nat'l Football League, 791 F.2d 1356 , 1365 (9th Cir.1986).

D. Wall Data's Attorneys' Fees

The Copyright Act provides for an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees ""to the prevailing party as part of the costs."" 17
U.S.C. § 505. A district court may consider (but is not limited to) five factors in making an attorneys' fees determination
pursuant to § 505. These factors are (1) the degree of success obtained, (2) frivolousness, (3) motivation, (4)
reasonableness of losing party's legal and factual arguments, and (5) the need to advance considerations of compensation
and deterrence. See Smith v. Jackson, 84 F.3d 1213 , 1221 (9th Cir.1996) (citations omitted). We review a district court's
decision regarding the award of attorneys' fees under the Copyright Act for an abuse of discretion. See Mattel, 353 F.3d at
814.



--- Page 9 ---
In this case, the district court cited the above-listed factors in its order granting Wall Data's motion for attorneys’ fees. It
found that Wall Data was the prevailing party, even though Wall Data's ultimate recovery was less than that which it
originally sought. Contrary to the Sheriff's Department's argument, this was not an abuse of discretion. See Nimmer on
Copyright § 14.10[B], at 14-176 to -177 (""The plaintiff will ordinarily be regarded as the prevailing party if he succeeds at trial
in establishing the defendant's liability, even if the damages awarded are nominal or nothing.""). The court therefore
concluded that attorneys' fees furthered the goal of copyright law. It found that the attorneys’ rates were reasonable within
the prevailing market, but reduced the total award based on the experience of the attorneys and the complexity of the
issues. Reversal is not appropriate here because we lack a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a

clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors. See Smith,_84 F.3d at 1221 .
Ill. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's orders entering final judgment following a jury trial against the
Sheriff's Department and awarding Wall Data attorneys' fees and costs.

Notes:
1. We use the terms ""computer software,” ""software application,"" and ""computer program"" interchangeably.

2. The Sheriff's Department argues that it bought 2,000 copies of the software, while Wall Data claims that the Sheriffs Department bought 2,000
licenses to the software. As discussed below, we conclude that the Sheriffs Department bought licenses to, not copies of, Wall Data's software.

3. Specifically, a Sheriff's Department computer network administrator would limit user access to the RUMBA Office program by assigning ""logical units""
to each computer workstation. These logical units were unique identification numbers that the workstation electronically presented to the host computer.
The host computer would then determine whether the electronic identification number matched one of the workstations authorized to communicate with
the host computer through the RUMBA software. If the workstation was not on the list of assigned logical units, the installed copy of the RUMBA software
would remain installed, but unused, in the hard drive of that workstation. Hard drive imaging ensured that employees could access RUMBA software on
any workstation in the facility, so long as that workstation had been assigned a logical unit by the network administrator.

4. A shrink-wrap license is a form on the packing or on the outside of the CD-ROM containing the software which states that by opening the packaging or
CD-ROM wrapper, the user agrees to the terms of the license. See, e.g., Specht v. Netscape Commce'n Corp.. 306 F.3d 17 , 22 n. 4 (2d Cir.2002).

5. A ""click-through license"" is a form embedded in computer software which requires the person initially installing the software onto a computer to
affirmatively click a box or an ""accept"" button indicating that the user accepts the terms of the license in order to complete the software installation and to
use the software after it is installed. See, e.g., SoftMan Prods. Co. v. Adobe Sys. Inc., 171 F.Supp.2d 1075 , 1080 (C.D.Cal.2001). The grant clause of
the standard RUMBA click-through license at the time of the 1996 purchase stated that:

Wall Data ... grants you (""You""), the end user, a non-exclusive license to use the enclosed software program ... on a single Designated Computer
for which the software has been activated. A ""Designated Computer"" is either (i) a stand-alone workstation, or (ii) a networked workstation which does
not permit the Software to be shared with other networked workstations. You may not use the Software in any other multiple computer or multiple user
arrangement. You may not use the Software other than on a Designated Computer, except that You may transfer the Software to another Designated
Computer and reactivate it for use with such other Designated Computer not more than once every 30 days, provided that the Software is removed from
the Designated Computer from which it is transferred.

6. To be clear, we do not hold that a fair use defense is not available simply because the infringer uses technology to make efficient use of its licenses.
The problematic aspect of the Sheriff's Department's use is that it took in excess of what it bargained for, not that it was technologically efficient. Thus, for
example, if the Sheriff's Department had saved time and money by hard drive imaging RUMBA software onto the number of computers for which it had
licenses, its ""efficiency"" would not create a problem.

7. The Sheriff's Department has argued that this document is inadmissible. As discussed more fully below, we believe the district court did not err in
allowing this document to be introduced.

8. A concurrent user license allows multiple users to access the same software, but limits the number of simultaneous computer users to the number of
licenses purchased. For example, where a licensee purchases five concurrent use licenses, five people would be able to access the software, but when
the sixth person tried to access the software, access would be denied.

9. We recognize that our decision in MAI has been criticized. See Nimmer on Copyright § 8.08[B][1][c], at 8-136; see also DSC Comme'ns Corp. v. Pulse
Comme'ns, Inc., 170 F.3d 1354 , 1360 (Fed.Cir.1999). Indeed, the first sale doctrine rarely applies in the software world because software is rarely
""sold.""_See Adobe Sys. Inc. v. One Stop Micro, Inc., 84 F.Supp.2d 1086 , 1091 (N.D.Cal.2000) (""[VJirtually all end users do not buy — but rather receive
a license for — software. The industry uses terms such as ‘purchase, ‘sell,’ ‘buy,’ . . . because they are convenient and familiar, but the industry is aware
that all software ... is distributed under license.""). By licensing copies of their computer programs, instead of selling them, software developers maximize
the value of their software, minimize their liability, control distribution channels, and limit multiple users on a network from using software simultaneously.
See Christian H. Nadan, Software Licensing in the 21st Century: Are Software ""Licenses"" Really Sales, and How Will the Software Industry Respond?,
32 AIPLA Q.J. 555. We decline to revisit our precedent in this case, because the Sheriff's Department's ""essential step"" defense fails for a more
fundamental reason — that hard drive imaging was not an essential step of installation — and thus any error is harmless.

OPINION & ORDER
Ramos, D.J.:

Tamita Brown, Glen S. Chapman, and Jason T. Chapman (collectively, ""Plaintiffs"") are musicians who created the song Fish
Sticks n’ Tater Tots (the ""Song""). In 2017, a documentary film titled Burlesque: Heart of the Glitter Tribe (the ""Film"") depicts a
group of burlesque dancers in Portland, Oregon, one of whom incorporated the Song in a performance. Amazon.com, Inc.
(""Amazon""), Netflix, Inc. (""Netflix""), and Apple Inc. (""Apple"") (collectively, ""Defendants"") are corporations that provide, among
other products, video streaming services. 1 The Film is available to view on Defendants’ platforms. Plaintiffs allege that the
use of the Song in the Film was unauthorized, and bring suit against Defendants for willful copyright infringement. Before the
Court is Defendants’ joint motion to dismiss the claims against Netflix and Apple, and for judgement on the pleadings for
Amazon. Doc. 28. Because the Court finds the Film's incorporation of the Song to be fair use, Defendants’ motion is
GRANTED.

|. BACKGROUND
A. Factual Background

Plaintiffs wrote, arranged, and recorded the Song in 2011. Compl. § 15. The Song, created for children, describes a
student's journey from her classroom to her school cafeteria to eat fish sticks and tater tots for lunch. Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of

performs an act in a food-themed show centered on the concept of a ""reverse mermaid,"" which, in her telling, is a creature
with the head of a fish and the legs of a woman. Mem. in Supp. at 3. During the performance, Jamboree steps behind a sign
labeled ""hot oil"" and emerges, having removed her fish head and changed into brown leggings to appear as though she has
been transformed into fish sticks. DVD Copy of Film at 27:47-30:34. During the performance, eight seconds of the Song
plays, consisting of the lyrics ""fish sticks n’ tater tots"" sung by Brown a total of five times. DVD Copy of Film at 29:55-30:03.
The performance continues for approximately 20 more seconds with different songs in the background. DVD Copy of Film at
30:04-30:24. The Film is available on Defendants’ websites for customers to purchase, rent, or stream. Compl. 922-27.

B. Procedural History

Plaintiffs filed the instant action on February 20, 2019, accusing Defendants of directly infringing their right to publicly
perform their work under 17 U.S.C. § 106(4) ; directly infringing their right to reproduce their copyrighted work under 17
U.S.C. § 106(1) ; and of contributory and vicarious copyright infringement, as well as inducement of copyright infringement,
of their rights of reproduction and public performance under 17 U.S.C. § 106 (1), (4). Compl. § 37-79. Amazon filed an
Answer on April 22, 2019. Netflix and Apple did not answer the Complaint. On November 13, 2019, Defendants jointly filed
the instant motion to dismiss the claims against Netflix and Apple pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and
for judgement on the pleadings on the claims against Amazon pursuant to Rule 12(c). Mem. in Supp. 29.

Il. STANDARD OF REVIEW

A. Rule 12(b)(6)

""To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief
that is plausible on its face.’ "" Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell
Atl. Corp. v. Twombly . 550 U.S. 544 , 570,127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) ). A claim is facially plausible ""when the
plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the
misconduct alleged."" /d. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 ). The plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to
show ""more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully."" /d. (citing Twombly. 550 U.S. at 557 , 127 S.Ct.
1955 ). However, this ""flexible ‘plausibility standard’ "" is not a heightened pleading standard,_/n re Elevator Antitrust Litig.
502 F.3d 47 , 50 n.3 (2d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted), and ""a complaint ... does not need detailed factual allegations"" to
survive a motion to dismiss. Twombly. 550 U.S. at 555 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 .

The question on a motion to dismiss ""is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail
[462 F.Supp.3d 459]

but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.""_Sikhs for Justice v. Nath , 893 F. Supp. 2d 598 ,

offered to support it.""_Halebian v. Berv , 644 F.3d 122 , 130 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
Accordingly, when ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court accepts all factual allegations in the
complaint as true and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor_ Nielsen v. Rabin . 746 F.3d 58 , 62 (2d Cir.

savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable ....""). ""For purposes of this rule, the complaint is deemed to include
any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by reference.""
Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc. , 282 F.3d 147 , 152 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).

B. Rule 12(c)

Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that ""[a]fter the pleadings are closed — but early enough not to
delay trial — a party may move for judgment on the pleadings."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). ""The standard for granting a Rule 12(c)
motion for judgment on the pleadings is identical to that [for granting] a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim.""
Lynch v. City of New York , 952 F.3d 67 , 75 (2d Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, a motion for
judgment on the pleadings should be granted ""if, from the pleadings, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law."" Burns Int'l Sec. Servs., Inc. v. Int'l Union, United Plant Guard Workers of Am. (UPGWA) & Its Local 537.47 F.3d 14 ,
16 (2d Cir. 1995) (per curiam). The Court accepts as true the pleadings’ factual allegations and draws all reasonable
inferences in the non-movant's favor. Nielsen v. Rabin , 746 F.3d 58 , 62 (2d Cir. 2014) ;see also Lombardo v. Dr. Seuss
Enter., L.P. , 279 F. Supp.3d 497, 505 (S.D.N.Y., 2017) (noting that in considering a motion for judgement on the pleading
""all pleadings — including defendant's counterclaims — are taken to be true, subject to the same plausibility standard that
applies on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion"").

Ill. DISCUSSION

Plaintiffs assert two claims of direct copyright infringement — by public performance under 17 U.S.C. § 106(4), and by
reproduction under 17 U.S.C. § 106(1) — and three claims that are contingent upon direct copyright infringement —
inducement of copyright infringement, contributory copyright infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement in violation of
their public performance and reproduction rights. Defendants do not dispute the validity of Plaintiffs’ copyright but argue that
their use of the Song is fair use, which is a complete defense to direct copyright infringement and, as a result, to any claims
that are contingent on the direct infringement. Plaintiffs, in turn, maintain that any fair use determination is premature at the
motion to dismiss stage and that, moreover, Defendants’ use was not fair.

The Court disagrees with Plaintiffs on both points and finds that Defendants’ use of the song was fair. As such, the Court
GRANTS Netflix and Apple's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), as well

[462 F.Supp.3d 460]
as Amazon's motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c).
A. Fair Use at the Motion to Dismiss Stage

As an initial matter, Plaintiffs argue that the factual record is too premature to engage in a fair use inquiry, and accordingly,
that the motion should be denied. Pls.’ Mem. in Opp'n of Mot. to Dismiss (Mem. in Opp'n), Doc. 32 at 2-3. Yet, Courts within
this Circuit have consistently considered motions to dismiss and motions for judgement on the pleadings regarding copyright
infringement claims. TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 839 F.3d 168 , 178 (2d Cir. 2016) (""[T]his court has acknowledged
the possibility of fair use being so clearly established by a complaint as to support dismissal of a copyright infringement
claim.""); Kelly-Brown v. Winfrey . 717 F.3d 295 , 308 (2d Cir. 2013) (finding motion to dismiss appropriate where ""where the



--- Page 3 ---
facts necessary to establish the defense are evident on the face of the complaint.""); Lombardo , 279 F. Supp.3d at 505. The
Court will therefore proceed to the merits of the motion.

B. Fair Use Defense to Direct Copyright Infringement

Copyright owners are entitled to six exclusive rights under 17 U.S.C § 106, including the rights to ""perform the copyrighted
work publicly"" and to ""perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission."" 17 U.S.C § 106 (4),
(6). In order to state a claim for infringement, ""a plaintiff must allege both (1) ownership of a valid copyright and (2)
infringement of the copyright by the defendant."" Spinelli v. Nat'l Football League , 903 F.3d 185 , 197 (2d Cir. 2018).
However, ""the fair use of a copyrighted work ... is not an infringement of copyright."" 17 U.S.C § 107. The following factors
are used to determine whether use is fair:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

Id. Consideration of each factor is ""mandatory."" Fox News Network, LLC v. Tveyes, Inc. , 883 F.3d 169 , 176 (2d Cir. 2018).
The Court will therefore consider each of these factors in turn.

1. Factor One: Purpose and Character

The first statutory factor asks the Court to consider the ""purpose and character"" of the reproduced work, also known as the
work's ""secondary use."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). At the core of this inquiry is whether the secondary use is transformative —
understood as communicating a ""further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning or
message."" Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust , 755 F.3d 87 , 96 (2d Cir. 2014) (citing Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510
U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (U.S. 1994) ). Thus, a transformative work is ""one that serves a new and
different function from the original work and is not a substitute for it."" /d. at 96. The use of unaltered copyrighted material —
also known as raw material — is not prohibited, and indeed, ""raw material, transformed in the creation of new information,
new aesthetics, new insights and understandings ... is the very type of activity"" contemplated by the fair use doctrine. Blanch
v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 252 (2d Cir. 2006). The inquiry must also consider

[462 F.Supp.3d 461]

whether the copyrighted materials are for a commercial or nonprofit educational purpose, finding ""the former tending to
weigh against a finding of fair use."" TCA Television Corp.__839 F.3d at 183 (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet, a finding
of commercial use is not dispositive, as ""the more transformative the new work, the less significance of other factors, like
commercialism."" /d.

Plaintiffs argue that because the Song itself is ""unaltered,"" its use cannot be transformative, and that because the subject of
both works is ""fish sticks,"" that the idea underlying the Song and the performance are ""exactly the same."" Mem. in Opp'n at
5. Moreover, they also suggest that record is underdeveloped as to whether the Film is a documentary, and thereby has an
educational purpose, or whether its purpose is purely commercial, thereby making a finding of fair use premature at the
motion to dismiss stage. /d. at 3. Neither of these arguments is persuasive.

Plaintiffs argue that ""[w]hen there is no alteration from the original there can be no [fair] use."" /d. In support, they rely
primarily on TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum ; however, the facts of that case are inapposite. In TCA Television Corp. v.
McCollum , the secondary use not only copied the raw material, but also duplicated ""the comedic purpose of the original
work,"" understood to be its original meaning. 839 F.3d at 184 . Here, while Defendants do not alter the Song and reference
its concept of ""fish sticks,"" the performance serves a ""new and different function"" from the Song, rather than offering merely
a substitute for its tale of a student on her way to lunch. HathiTrust._755 F.3d at 96 . Indeed, even Plaintiffs repeatedly note
the differences in purpose and character between the performance and the Song: the Song was created ""with children being
the intended audience,"" whereas the Film is ""centered on strippers"" and uses the Song ""while a scantily clad woman ...
begins to perform a strip dance routine."" Compl. { 17-18, 20; Mem. in Opp'n at 5. These descriptions only confirm that
Defendants’ use transforms the Song: Whereas the Song communicates a light-hearted children's story about a student
looking forward to lunch in the school cafeteria, the Film depicts decidedly mature themes that portray fish sticks not as a
lunch food, but as a component of a ""reverse mermaid."" CD of the Song; DVD Copy of Film at 27:47—30:34. These are,
undoubtedly, ""new aesthetics."" Blanch__467 F.3d at 252 .

As to whether or not the Film has a commercial purpose, Defendants argue that their status as a commercial entity is
irrelevant because the Film is transformative and is a documentary, and accordingly, offers criticism or commentary. Mem. in
Supp. 29 at 14. Regardless of Plaintiffs’ claim that the Film is not a documentary — in contradiction of the evidence
available in the record plainly demonstrating its documentary nature — the commercial nature of a work nonetheless is not

determinative of the first factor analysis. DVD Copy of Film; Campbell__510 U.S. at 584 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (noting that ""nearly



--- Page 4 ---
all of the illustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of § 107 ... are generally conducted for profit"" (internal quotations
omitted)). Even if the Film were purely commercial, as Plaintiffs allege, because the secondary use is of a transformative
nature, the first factor still weighs in favor of Defendants. See Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 708 (2d Cir. 2013) (""Although
there is no question that [Defendant's] artworks are commercial, we do not place much significance on that fact due to the
transformative nature of the work"").

Thus, the first factor weighs in favor of Defendants.

[462 F.Supp.3d 462]

2. Factor Two: Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second statutory factor considers the ""nature of the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C § 107(2). This factor ""has rarely played

a significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute."" Authors Guild v. Google. Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 220 (2d Cir. 2015).
Indeed, because this analysis ""inevitably involves"" the first factor's transformative purpose inquiry, ""the second factor may be

of limited usefulness where the creative work of art is being used for a transformative purpose."" /d. ; Blanch__467 F.3d at 257

Plaintiffs argue that the Song is intended for creative expression for public dissemination and that this factor weighs in their
favor because Defendants have not provided a persuasive justification for their use. Mem. in Opp'n at 10. Notwithstanding
Plaintiffs’ characterization of the Song, the transformative nature of the Film renders the second factor ""of limited
usefulness."" Blanch__ 467 F.3d at 257 . And while Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have not provided an adequate
justification for their use, such requirement is satisfied when the secondary use is found to be transformative. Google, Inc._.
804 F.3d at 220 (finding the second factor ""not dispositive"" when the secondary use is transformative, even if ""one (or all) of
the plaintiff works were [creative]""); Fox News Network, LLC_, 883 F.3d at 178 (finding that where the first statutory factor
favors secondary use due to modest transformative use — ""albeit slightly"" — the second factor ""plays no significant role"").

Accordingly, the second factor is neutral.

3. Factor Three: Amount and Substantiality

The third statutory factor considers the ""amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a
whole."" 17 U.S.C § 107(3). The analysis is ""with reference to the allegedly copyrighted work, not the infringing work."" Bil/
Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. , 448 F.3d 605 , 613 (2d Cir. 2006). The factor ""calls for thought not only about
the quantity of the materials used, but about their quality and importance, too."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 587 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 .
The quantitative inquiry considers whether the secondary use ""employs more of the copyrighted work than is necessary,""
whereas the qualitative inquiry asks whether the use was ""excessive in relation to any valid purposes asserted under the first
factor."" HathiTrust._755 F.3d at 96 (citing Campbell__510 U.S. at 588 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (1994) ). If the use qualitatively
amounts to ""the heart"" of the original work, although quantitatively minimal, the use could be considered substantial;
however, use of ""the heart"" of the copyrighted work is not dispositive. Indeed, when the work is transformative, ""the
secondary use must be [permitted] to conjure up at least enough of the original to fulfill its transformative purpose."" Cariou_.
714 F.3d at 710 (citing Campbell__510 U.S. at 588 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Quantitatively, the Film uses eight seconds of the Song's 190 seconds, or 4.21 percent of the Song. Mem. in Opp'n at 11;
DVD Copy of Film at 29:55-30:03. Plaintiffs argue that because the segment used is repeated three times in the Song, that
the total used is more accurately 12.63 percent of the Song. Mem. in Opp'n at 11. Yet Plaintiffs do not point to a single
instance in which a copyrighted work's repeated refrain was counted more than once for the quantitative assessment. Mem.
in Opp'n at 11. This component, therefore, favors Defendants.

[462 F.Supp.3d 463]

Repetition can, however, be considered in the qualitative inquiry. Plaintiffs argue that the segment used in the Film
represents the ""heart"" of the Song, noting that the cited passage is the chorus that gives the Song its name and is repeated
throughout the Song. Mem. in Opp'n at 11. Even assuming that this segment is the ""heart"" of the Song, this does not end
the analysis. See , Lennon v. Premise Media Corp. , 556 F. Supp. 2d 310 , 326 (S.D.N. Y. 2008) (finding that the secondary
use's inclusion of a musical phrase used in 50 percent of the copyrighted material was not excessive, even though it
contained the heart of the original material). Where the heart of the copyrighted work is at the core of the transformative
character, use of the heart is permissible ""to fulfill its transformative purpose."" Cariou_, 714 F.3d at 710 ; see Lennon, 556 F.
Supp. 2d at 326 (finding it was ""not clear that defendants could have used any portion of the song [to fulfill its
transformational purpose] without ending up with an excerpt"" at the copyrighted work's heart). Thus, use of the ""heart"" of a
work is permissible when it is necessary to achieve its transformation. Such is the case with Defendants’ use — the dance
depicted in the Film requires the phrase ""fish sticks and tater tots"" to communicate the ""reverse mermaid"" transformation.
Therefore, the third factor's qualitative component also favors Defendants.

Because the portion of the Song used by Defendants is neither quantitively nor qualitatively excessive, the third factor
weighs in favor of a finding of fair use.

4. Factor Four: Effect Upon the Potential Market or Value


--- Page 5 ---
The fourth factor considers ""the effect of the [secondary] use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.""
17 U.S.C. § 107(4). This factor is ""undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use."" Harper & Row Publishers, Inc.
v. Nation Enters. 471 U.S. 539 , 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . The critical inquiry is whether the secondary
use ""usurps"" the market of the original, ""where the infringer's target audience and the nature of the infringing content is the
same as the original."" Cariou__714 F.3d at 709 . In such instances, the secondary use competes with the original ""so as to
deprive the rights holder of significant revenues because of the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the
copy in preference to the original."" Google, Inc._. 804 F.3d at 223 . This likelihood is closely linked to the first factor, as ""the
more the copying is done to achieve a purpose that differs from the purpose of the original, the less likely it is that the copy
will serve as a satisfactory substitute for the original."" Id. (citing Campbell__510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). Critically, the
ourth factor must also consider "" ‘not only the ... market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer,’ but
also the market harm that would result from ‘unrestricted and widespread conduct of the [same] sort.’ "" Fox News Network,
LLC_, 883 F.3d at 179 (citing Campbell__510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164).

Here, the fourth factor weighs decisively in favor of Defendants. Plaintiffs repeatedly acknowledge that the Film targets a
different audience from their own, noting that they ""created the Song with children being the intended audience,"" whereas
he Film is ""centered on strippers"" and is used ""during a scene in which a woman dances to the Song while removing her
clothing."" Compl. 17-18, 20. As the Film's use is transformative of the original, the potential market — children or those
who would acquire the Song on behalf of children — would not ""opt to

462 F.Supp.3d 464]

acquire the copy"" of a limited eight seconds of the Song ""in preference to the original."" Google, Inc._. 804 F.3d at 223 (finding
hat an online service deemed transformational, which allows users to view only ""snippets"" of books, did not create a
competing substitute for the books). Put another way, it is unlikely that parents would purchase copies of the film for their
minor children so that they could hear the excerpt of the Song in the Film.

Plaintiffs also argue that if such use of the Song were to become widespread, that is, ""without first obtaining a license from
them],"" Plaintiffs would potentially be precluded ""from participating in at least two entire segments of the music industry,""
which they identify as ""music for an individual to at least appear to dance to, and as background music"" in films. Mem. in
Opp'n at 13. Yet, ""not every effect on potential licensing revenues enters the analysis under the fourth factor,"" anda
copyright holder ""has no right to demand that users take a license unless the use that would be made is one that would
otherwise infringe an exclusive right."" Fox News Network, LLC__ 883 F.3d at 180 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Moreover, only impacts on ""potential licensing revenues for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets should
be legally cognizable."" /d. Here, it is unreasonable to consider the potential uses named by Plaintiffs, which were unalleged
in their complaint and only provided in response to Defendants’ motion. Because Defendants met their burden by showing
that the Film's secondary use would not usurp that of the original, other similarly hypothetical uses would equally not deprive
them of prospective audiences. Thus, the fourth factor weighs in favor of Defendants.

ake

Because the first, third, and fourth factors weigh in favor of Defendants, and the second factor is merely neutral, their alleged
use of the Song is fair within the meaning of 17 U.S.C § 107. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims of direct copyright infringement
by public performance and reproduction fail to meet the pleading standard required by Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(c). See Lynch_.
952 F.3d at 75 (finding the ""standard for granting a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is identical to that [for
granting] a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim"").

C. Contributory, Vicarious, and Inducement of Copyright Infringement

Plaintiffs also assert claims for inducement of copyright infringement, contributory copyright infringement, and vicarious
copyright infringement in violation of their exclusive rights of reproduction and public performance under 17 U.S.C. § 106 (1),
(4). Compl. 37-79. While the Copyright Act does not create liability for contributory, vicarious, or inducement of copyright
infringement, ""the common-law doctrine that one who knowingly participates or furthers a tortious act is jointly and severally
liable with the prime [sic] tortfeasor."" Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110 , 117 (2d Cir. 2010). However, there can
be no contributory, vicarious, or inducement of infringement where no direct infringement exists. Cariou__714 F.3d at 712 .
Because Defendants have successfully invoked the doctrine of fair use, no underlying direct infringement exists. Fox News
Network, LLC_, 883 F.3d at 176 (finding fair use is an affirmative defense to copyright infringement). Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
claims for inducement of copyright infringement, contributory copyright infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement
also fail to meet the requirements of both Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(c).

[462 F.Supp.3d 465]
IV. CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated above, the Defendants’ motion to dismiss and for judgement on the pleadings is GRANTED with
prejudice. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion, Doc. 28, and to close the case.

It is SO ORDERED.

MEMORANDUM OPINION

T.S. Ellis, Ill, United States District Judge

The central dispute in this copyright infringement action is whether defendant's use of two of plaintiff's photographs of
famous musicians to accompany online articles about those musicians' political views constitutes fair use of the
photographs, not impermissible infringement.

The following facts are derived from the facts contained in defendant's list of undisputed facts that plaintiff does not oppose.
Pursuant to E.D. Va. Local Rule 56(B), ""each brief in support of a motion for summary judgment shall include a specifically
captioned section listing all material facts"" the moving party alleges to be undisputed. In its response, the non-moving party
must include ""a specifically captioned section listing all material facts as to which it is contended there exists a genuine issue
necessary to be litigated"" and must cite parts of the record relied on to support the facts alleged. /d. Defendant complied with
the requirement and plaintiff, for the most part, did not contest the listed facts, but instead added additional facts. Those
additional facts are noted below where relevant and supported by admissible record facts.

The Parties
+ Plaintiff, Larry Philpot, has worked as a professional photographer since 2007 and 2008.
- As a part of his work, plaintiff photographs musical artists in concert.

+ Plaintiff posts his photographs on websites like Wikimedia, in part, to achieve greater fame, making his
photographs more valuable in the long-term.

+ Defendant, Media Research Center Inc., is an IRS approved 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with its principal
place of business in Reston, Virginia.

+ Defendant publishes news and commentary regarding issues of public debate in order to expose and critique
media bias against American Judeo-Christian religious beliefs.

+ Defendant operates a website, www.mrctv.org (""MRCTV""), to broadcast conservative values, culture, politics,
and liberal media bias and to entertain the public. Plaintiff adds that defendant also owns MRCTV to generate
revenue for MRC via donations and advertising revenue.

Chesney Photograph and Pro-Life Article
* The Chesney Photograph depicts Kenny Chesney performing in concert.

[279 F.Supp.3d 711]
+ Plaintiff took the Chesney Photograph to depict Chesney performing in concert; plaintiff did not take the
photograph to provide commentary on Chesney's political beliefs. Plaintiff adds that plaintiff created the Chesney
Photograph for an additional purpose, namely to enhance visually articles about Chesney.

+ Plaintiff owns a copyright for the Chesney Photograph.

+ Plaintiff uploaded the Chesney Photograph to the Wikimedia website, where the photograph was available for
use, subject to a Creative Commons attribution license, version 3.0 (""CCL"").

* The CCL does not require users to provide monetary compensation for use of the Chesney Photograph, but it


--- Page 2 ---
does require licensees to identify plaintiff as the author of the Chesney Photograph.

* The only remuneration plaintiff has ever received for the Chesney Photograph is the undisclosed sums plaintiff
received in connection with demand letters plaintiff sent to alleged infringers. The record is devoid of any
information about the amount of money plaintiff received, and it appears that plaintiff's interest is in artistic
attribution, not financial remuneration, for the use of the Chesney Photograph.

* On or about January 22, 2015, defendant posted an article on MRCTV, entitled "" '8 A-List Celebrities That Are
Pro-Life"" (""Pro-Life Article""), which included pictures of, and stories about, celebrities who are supportive of the
pro-life movement.

* The Pro-Life Article contained plaintiff's Chesney Photograph alongside a discussion of a pro-life song written
by Chesney.

* The Pro-Life Article did not attribute the Chesney Photograph to plaintiff.
* Defendant did not charge for access to the Pro-Life Article.

* From January 22, 2015 to September 22, 2017, defendant generated approximately $16.68 in revenue
attributable to advertisements run on the webpage displaying the Pro-Life Article.

¢ From July 13, 2017 through October 10, 2017, defendant received approximately $50 in donations through the
MRCTV website. These donations may have been received through the link located on the webpage displaying
the Pro-Life Article.

Kid Rock Photograph and Senate Article
* The Kid Rock Photograph depicts Kid Rock performing in concert.
+ Plaintiff took the Kid Rock Photograph to depict Kid Rock performing in concert; plaintiff did not know Kid Rock
was running for U.S. Senate when plaintiff took Kid Rock's photograph. Plaintiff adds that plaintiff created the Kid
Rock Photograph for an additional purpose, namely to enhance visually articles about Kid Rock.

+ Plaintiff owns a copyright for the Kid Rock Photograph

+ Plaintiff uploaded the Kid Rock Photograph to the Wikimedia website on or about September 2013, where the
photograph was available for use, subject to a CCL.

+ The CCL does not require users to pay to use the Kid Rock Photograph, but it does require licensees to identify
plaintiff as the author of the Kid Rock Photograph.

[279 F.Supp.3d 712]

The only remuneration plaintiff has ever received for the Kid Rock Photograph is the undisclosed sums plaintiff
received in connection with demand letters plaintiff sent to alleged infringers. The record is devoid of any
nformation about the amount of money plaintiff received, and it appears that plaintiff's interest is in artistic
attribution, not financial remuneration, for the use of the Kid Rock Photograph.

On or about July 13, 2017, defendant posted an article on MRCTV, entitled ""Kid Rock Announces 2018 U.S.
enate Bid"" (""Senate Article""), which discussed Kid Rock's announced campaign for election to the United
ates Senate.

NN

* The Senate Article contained a cropped version of plaintiff's Kid Rock Photograph with a headline banner
across the bottom of the photograph.

+ The Senate Article did not attribute the Kid Rock Photograph to plaintiff.

¢ From July 13, 2017 until September 22, 2017, defendant generated approximately $9.89 in revenue attributable
to advertisements run on the webpage displaying the Senate Article.

¢ From July 13, 2017 through October 10, 2017, defendant received approximately $50 in donations through the
MRCTV website. These donations may have been received through the link located on the webpage displaying
the Senate Article.

On July 20, 2017, plaintiff initiated this copyright infringement action against defendant, seeking damages for defendant's
allegedly unauthorized copying and public display of plaintiff's photographs of Kenny Chesney and Kid Rock. Following
completion of discovery, defendant, on November 1, 2017, filed the motion for summary judgment at issue here, arguing: (i)
that plaintiff has waived his right to sue for copyright infringement by licensing the photographs; (ii) that defendant's use of
the photographs falls under the ""fair use"" exception to copyright protections; and (iii) that defendant was exercising its First


--- Page 3 ---
Amendment speech rights when it used the photographs. Plaintiff opposes the motion, contending: (i) that defendant cannot
use the license as a defense to the copyright infringement action; (ii) that defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock
Photographs does not fall within the ""fair use"" exception; and (iii) that the First Amendment does not insulate defendant from
liability.

The standard of review on motions for summary judgment is too well-settled to warrant extensive discussion. Under Rule 56,
Fed. R. Civ. P., summary judgment is appropriate only where there is ""no genuine dispute as to any material fact"" such that
the moving party ""is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.""_Celotex v. Catrett 477 U.S. 317 , 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91
L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . A genuine dispute exists if ""there is sufficient evidence on which a reasonable jury could return a
verdict in favor of the nonmoving party.""Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 , 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d
202 (1986) . In evaluating this question, courts must ""view the evidence in the light most favorable to...the nonmovant.""
Dennis v. Columbia Colleton Med. Ctr., Inc. , 290 F.3d 639 , 645 (4th Cir. 2002). The nonmovant, however, cannot rely on
""mere allegations""; rather, the nonmovant ""must set forth specific facts that go beyond the mere existence of a scintilla of
evidence."" Glynn v. EDO Corp. , 710 F.3d 209 , 213 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal quotations and citations omitted).

[279 F.Supp.3d 713]
I.

The threshold question in this case is whether plaintiff waived his right to sue for copyright infringement by granting a
nonexclusive license to use his copyrighted Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs. The Second Circuit has recognized that ""
a] copyright owner who grants a nonexclusive license to use his copyrighted material waives his right to sue the licensee for
copyright infringement."" Graham v. James , 144 F.3d 229 , 236 (2d Cir. 1998). But where, as here, a nonexclusive license is
erminated, the copyright owner may then sue the former licensee for copyright infringement in the event that the former
licensee continues to use the copyrighted work. Tattoo Art Inc. v. TAT Int'l LLC , 498 Fed.Appx. 341, 346 (4th Cir. 2012) (""In
he post-termination context, TAT's continued display of the copyrighted works constituted infringement for the additional
reason that TAT was contractually required to ‘immediately cease all sales’ of the stencils in light of Tattoo Art's notice of
ermination for breach."").

Here, it is clear that plaintiff granted a nonexclusive license for the use of his copyrighted material when he posted the
Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs on Wikimedia under CCLs. The CCL is a worldwide, nonexclusive license that allows
any party, to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt the work for free without seeking express permission. It is thus undisputed
hat plaintiff offered the public nonexclusive licenses for both the Chesney and the Kid Rock Photographs.

First, plaintiff unpersuasively argues that defendant was not a party to the license because there was no meeting of the
minds with respect to the terms of the license. The flaw in this argument is that a license is not a contract; rather, a license is
""permission to use a copyrighted work in a particular specified manner..."" Saxelbye Architects, Inc. v. First Citizens Bank &
Tr. Co. , 1997 WL 702290, at *3 (4th Cir. Nov. 3, 1997). Indeed, ""[a] nonexclusive license may be granted unilaterally by a
copyright holder"" so no meeting of the minds is required. Crump v. QD3 Entm't, Inc. , 2011 WL 446296, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.
8, 2011) (citation omitted). Accordingly, the mere fact that plaintiff uploaded the Photographs to Wikimedia under a
nonexclusive CCL is sufficient to grant a license to defendant.

But this does not end the analysis, as it is also clear that the CCL for both Photographs automatically terminates upon a
licensee's breach of the licenese. See Dunnegan Decl. Ex. | (""This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.""). Here, the parties do not dispute that attribution was a
material term of the license, and the parties agree that defendant publicly displayed the Photographs without attribution. See
Dunnegan Decl. Ex. F. § 16-38, 96, 106. Thus, a reasonable juror could find that defendant breached the license, and as a
result, the license was terminated. After termination of the license, defendant's continued use of the Chesney and Kid Rock
Photographs would then be grounds for plaintiffs copyright infringement action provided there is no other defense, including
fair use.

Section 106 of the Copyright Act grants ""a bundle of exclusive rights to the owner of the copyright,"" including the rights ""to
publish, copy, and distribute the author's work."" Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. , 471 U.S. 539 , 546-47,
105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 106 ). These rights, however, are ""subject to a list of statutory
exceptions, including the exception for fair use provided in 17 U.S.C. § 107.""

Bond v. Blum, 317 F.3d 385 , 393 (4th Cir. 2003), abrogated on other grounds by Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. , —
U.S. , 136 S.Ct. 1979 , 195 L.Ed.2d 368 (2016) . If fair use, or another statutory exception, is established, then the use

of the copyrighted work does not infringe on the copyright owner's exclusive rights. See 17 U.S.C. § 107.

The dispute here focuses on fair use and § 107 of the Copyright Act provides that the following factors must be examined to
determine whether a copyrighted work's use in a particular case constitutes ""fair use"", including:


--- Page 4 ---
(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
17 U.S.C. § 107.

Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit precedent make clear that in weighing these factors, courts should not treat the factors in
isolation, ""but rather the results are to be weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."" Bouchat v. Balt. Ravens
Ltd. P'ship. (Bouchat I). 619 F.3d 301 , 307-08 (4th Cir. 2010) (quoting Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc..510 U.S. 569 ,
578, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted)). At the same time, Fourth Circuit
precedent has ""placed primary focus on the first factor."" Bouchat v. Balt. Ravens Ltd. P'ship. (Bouchat II)_, 737 F.3d 932 ,
937 (4th Cir. 2013). And the Supreme Court has noted the paramount importance of the fourth factor. Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc.._471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (""This last factor is undoubtedly the single most important element of fair
use.""). As such, the crux of the parties’ fair use dispute focuses chiefly on the first and fourth factors. As described below,
the undisputed factual record points persuasively to the conclusion that defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock
Photographs constituted fair use. Thus, defendant's motion for summary judgment must be granted.

A.

The first fair use factor—""the purpose and character of the use"" 1—weighs in favor of defendant because the undisputed
factual record reveals that defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs is transformative and essentially
noncommercial. In this respect, the Fourth Circuit has adopted a two-part inquiry under this first factor, considering: (i)
""whether the new work is transformative;"" and (ii) ""the extent to which the use serves a commercial purpose."" Bouchat IL.
737 F.3d at 939 . A work is transformative if, instead of ""merely supersed[ing] the objects of the original creation,"" the new
work ""adds something new, with a further purpose or difference character, altering the first with new expression, meaning or
message."" Campbell. 510 U.S. at 578 -79, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotation marks omitted). 2 Moreover, the Fourth Circuit
has made clear that ""[the use of copyrighted work] can be transformative in function or purpose without altering or actually
adding to the original work."" A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye_, 562 F.3d at 639 .

[279 F.Supp.3d 715]

These principles, applied here, compel the conclusion that defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs was
transformative. The undisputed factual record discloses that the ""expression,"" ""meaning,"" and ""message"" of defendant's use
of the Photographs here is plainly different from plaintiff's intended use of the Photographs. Plaintiff testified that he was a
professional photographer of musicians and that he took the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs to depict the musicians in
concert. See PI. Dep. 43:14-22. 3 By contrast, defendant used the images for the purposes of news reporting and
commentary on issues of public concern—namely, informing citizens about pro-life celebrities and conservative celebrities
running for political office. See Martin Decl. { 15, 26. Moreover, the photographs as used on defendant's website were
surrounded by content and commentary unrelated to the musicians performing in concert; the Chesney Photograph was
accompanied by Pro-Life song lyrics and the Kid Rock Photograph was alongside information about the 2018 U.S. Senate
election in Michigan. See Ex. A—1, A-2. Plaintiff admitted that he in no way had this purpose in mind—identifying these
celebrities as pro-life or candidates for U.S. Senate—at the time he took the photographs. See Pl. Dep. 44:21—45:2, 74:21—
75:3. 4In sum, the defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs is transformative because defendant's
purpose in using the Photographs—to identify the celebrities as pro-life advocates or conservative Senate candidates—was
different from plaintiffs purpose in taking the Photographs.

This conclusion is consistent with precedent from this circuit and elsewhere. In a series of cases in which a copyright owner
sued the Baltimore Ravens for using his copyrighted logo, the Fourth Circuit considered the transformative nature of various
videos depicting the copyright owner's Ravens logo. In Bouchat | , the Fourth Circuit found the use of the copyrighted

[279 F.Supp.3d 716]

logo in highlight reels from past seasons was not transformative because ""[t]he use of the logo in the films serve[d] the same
purpose that it did when defendants first infringed..."", namely the logo ""identifies the football player wearing it with the
Baltimore Ravens."" Bouchat |, 619 F.3d at 309 . By contrast, in Bouchat I/ , the Fourth Circuit found that the use of the logo
in videos summarizing the performance of players and highlighting the history of the team was transformative. Bouchat IL,
737 F.3d at 940 . The Bouchat II court noted that the season highlight films at issue in Bouchat I ""did not change the way in
which viewers experienced the logo, making the use non-transformative."" /d. at 941. The performance summaries and
historical videos in Bouchat II , by contrast, used the footage ""to tell stories and not simply rehash the season,"" and as such,
those videos were transformative. /d.

Defendant's use of the Photographs much more closely resembles the use of the Baltimore Ravens logos in Bouchat I/ than


--- Page 5 ---
the use of the logos in Bouchat |. Unlike Bouchat | , defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs changes
the way in which viewers experience the Photographs. Specifically, although in Bouchat I , the films ""capture[d] the logo as it
originally appeared, and the logo remain[ed] a symbol identifying the Ravens,"" Sin this case, defendant captures the
Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs as they originally appear but the Photographs do not solely remain Photographs
identifying those celebrities as musicians. Rather, defendant's placing the Photographs alongside its MRCTV articles
identifies these celebrities as pro-life advocates and possible conservative U.S. Senate candidates, thereby creating, as in
Bouchat II , a ""new expression, meaning, or message."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . As in Bouchat II, the
Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs here ""tell new stories"" about the celebrities instead of simply rehashing their identities
as musicians. Bouchat I 737 F.3d at 941 .

Notably, other circuits have determined that the use of photographs is transformative where, as here, the use serves
purposes beyond mere artistic expression, by informing the public about a newsworthy event, providing commentary, or
adding other social benefit. See, e.g. , Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com Inc._, 508 F.3d 1146 , 1165 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding
that the use of thumbnail images in search engines was transformative because the use ""improv[ed] access to information
on the [I]nternet"" and provided a ""social benefit by incorporating an original work into a new work""); Nunez v. Caribbean Int'l
News Corp. , 235 F.3d 18 , 22-23 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that the republication of photographs taken from a modeling
portfolio in a newspaper was transformative because the photographs informed while also serving an entertainment
function). Similarly, here, the use of the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs in association with the Pro-Life and Senate
Articles improves access to information and provides social benefit by allowing readers to identify the celebrities depicted as
individuals who share their political views.

The cases plaintiff cites do not compel a contrary result. Thus, in Ba/s/ey v. LFP Inc. , 691 F.3d 747 (6th Cir. 2012) , the Sixth
Circuit determined that a defendant had not demonstrated that his use of a photograph was transformative as a matter of

law. The Baisley case involved a photograph of a news reporter participating in a wet t-shirt concert that was subsequently

published in a magazine as a part of a ""Hot News Babe"" contest. /d. at 747-49. The Sixth Circuit rejected the defendant's
argument that the picture was published

[279 F.Supp.3d 717]

to ""illustrate its entertainment news story"" and considered it more likely that the photo, and the article in which it appeared,
were simply used ""to enhance readership, rather than as a social commentary."" /d. at 759. By contrast here, there is no
dispute here that defendant used the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs as a part of articles providing social commentary
and reporting on news. To be sure, the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs may have enhanced defendant's articles
visually, but the articles, together with the Photographs, were plainly used for the socially beneficial purposes of conveying a
political message beyond merely enhancing readership. Accordingly, this case stands in stark contrast to Balsley .

Plaintiff also cites Psihoyos v. Nat'l Exam'r, 1998 WL 336655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 22, 1998), which is also unpersuasive.
The defendant there used a photograph of a car for precisely the same reason for which the photograph was created,
namely to show the appearance of an art car, a car covered in artwork. /d. Here, by contrast, defendant is using the
Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs for a purpose completely different from the purpose for which the Photographs were
created, namely to identify certain celebrities as pro-life advocates or potential conservative Senate candidates. Thus,
Psihoyos , like Balsley , is also unpersuasive here.

Plaintiff also argues, unpersuasively, that the photograph itself must newsworthy for the use of the photograph alongside a
news article to be transformative. This is simply not the case. Plaintiff bases his argument on dicta from an unpublished
district court case, Barcroft Media Ltd. v. Coed Media Grp. LLC , 2017 WL 5032993 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2017). But that case is
neither controlling nor persuasive. In Barcroft Media Ltd. , the court considered whether a gossip website's use of paparazzi
photographs of celebrities alongside articles about those celebrities constituted fair use. The court found that the plaintiffs
took the photographs at issue ""to document the comings and goings of celebrities, illustrate their fashion and lifestyle
choices, and accompany gossip and news articles about their lives."" /d. at *6. The defendant then used the photographs for
precisely these purposes as the defendant posted the photographs alongside articles about the celebrities' fashion choices
and gossip about their lives. /d. Here, by contrast, plaintiff took the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs to depict the
musicians in concert. See PI. Dep. 43:14-16, 74:13-17; see also id. at 74:8-17, 75:4-6. Had defendant used the Chesney
and Kid Rock Photographs alongside articles about the concerts depicted, then that use might not have been
transformative. But importantly, defendant here used the Photographs in a completely different context, namely to identify
these celebrities as pro-life advocates or conservative candidates for office.

In sum, because defendant used the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs in a new context, to tell new stories about the
musicians as pro-life advocates or candidates for office, defendant's use of the Photographs was transformative.

The second part of the inquiry under the first fair use factor is whether the use of copyrighted work is commercial in nature.
The undisputed factual record discloses that defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs was not essentially
commercial. At most, defendant's use of the Photographs might be considered commercial only insofar as defendant
received very small amounts of revenue ($26.57) through advertisements on the webpages associated with the articles and
may have received minor donations ($50) through links on the webpages associated with the articles.

[279 F.Supp.3d 718]


--- Page 6 ---
At the same time, the undisputed factual record reveals that defendant does not charge readers for access to its articles,
nor did it sell the Chesney and Kid Rock photographs to other parties. See Martin Decl. { 20, 31. Instead, defendant's
articles were available for free to anyone accessing the Internet. Compare Nunez__235 F.3d at 22 (finding use was
commercial where ""[t]he photographs were used in part to create an enticing lead page that would prompt readers to
purchase the newspaper""). Moreover, defendant is a nonprofit organization and its mission is to expose and critique media
bias against what it views as traditional American Judeo-Christian religious beliefs, not to increase its own profits. See
Martin Decl. ¥] 3-4. Accordingly, defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock photographs is ""more incidental and less
exploitative"" than the commercial use typically seen in copyright infringement cases._Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp. . 336 F.3d 811

, 818 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding ""use of [copyrighted work] was more incidental and less exploitative in nature than more
traditional types of commercial use"" where defendant did not use images directly to promote the website nor did defendant
try to profit by selling the images directly).

In sum, the record discloses that even assuming defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs produced a
very small amount of revenue, it was far from essentially commercial. Given this and given that the Supreme Court has
recognized that any commercial use is not determinative in and of itself, Sthis factor does not outweigh the transformative
nature of defendant's use of the Photographs.

The second factor—""the nature of the copyrighted work"" 2—is neutral. To begin with, where, as here, the copyrighted work
is published, 8 the fair use is broader in scope. See A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye__ 562 F.3d at 640 (citing Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc.._471 U.S. at 555 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ). But the Supreme Court has also instructed that ""fair use is more likely
to be found in factual works than in fictional works,"" and ""a use is less likely to be deemed fair when the copyrighted work is
a creative product."" Stewart v. Abend , 495 U.S. 207 , 237,110 S.Ct. 1750 , 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) (internal quotation
marks and alteration omitted). The Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs are likely both factual and creative—the
Photographs are factual insofar as they depict the celebrities in concert, and the Photographs are creative insofar as the
photographer made judgments about lighting, lens speed, and angle in capturing the Photographs. 2 Accordingly, this factor
is neutral.

Cc.
The third fair use factor considers the ""amount and substantiality of the portion
[279 F.Supp.3d 719]

used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole."" 12 Generally, as the amount of copyrighted material that is used
increases, the likelihood of fair use decreases. Here, defendant used all of Chesney Photograph and only slightly cropped
plaintiffs photograph of Kid Rock. Accordingly, this factor weighs against a fair use finding. See Reiner v. Nishimori , 2017
WL 1545589 (M.D. Tenn. Apr. 28, 2017) (quoting Balsley_. 691 F.3d at 760 ) (""[C]opying an entire work militates against a
finding of fair use."").

D.

The final factor involves consideration of ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work""; 11 that is, whether ""the defendants’ [use of the work] would materially impair the marketability of the work and whether
it would act as a market substitute for it."" Bouchat IL 737 F.3d at 943 .12In this regard, courts have considered ""(i) ""the
extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer""; and (ii) ""whether unrestricted and
widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant...would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential
market.""_Nunez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp. , 235 F.3d 18 , 24 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting /nfinity Broad. Corp. v. Kirkwood
150 F.3d 104 , 110 (2d Cir. 1998) ).

This factor, applied here, weighs in favor of a fair use finding because there is no showing on this record of any impact on
any economic market for the Chesney or Kid Rock Photographs. To begin with, it is undisputed that, to date, there has been
no economic impact on any market for the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs as a result of defendant's use of the
photographs. Indeed, on this record, there is no economic market for the Photographs. Plaintiff admits that he posted his
photographs on Wikimedia for use by others for free, rather than selling them for a profit, because his purpose in taking the
Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs was to gain greater fame, not to make money. Indeed, plaintiff admits that he has
received no remuneration for use of the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs outside of the litigation context. See PI. Dep. at
48:10-50:9, 77:15-18. 43 Defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs cannot impair the marketability of
plaintiffs works where, as here, plaintiff has not actually contemplated marketing those works. See Am. Geophysical Union
v. Texaco , 60 F.3d 913 (2d Cir. 1994) (noting that the assertion that plaintiff has suffered some ""adverse effect on its
potential licensing revenues as a consequence of [the defendant's use]"" does not carry weight if the defendant ""filled a
market niche that the [copyright owner] simply had no interest in occupying""). Similarly, were defendant's use of the
Photographs to become widespread, plaintiff would not lose out on any revenue because plaintiff contemplated allowing
parties to use the Photographs for free. In sum, because plaintiff offers his Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs for

[279 F.Supp.3d 720]


--- Page 7 ---
free, plaintiff has not demonstrated that any market harm has resulted from defendant's use of the Photographs or that any
market harm would result were defendant's use of the Photographs to become widespread.

Plaintiff argues that defendant's failure to attribute the Kid Rock and Chesney Photographs diminished the future value of
plaintiffts photographs because attribution would make plaintiff famous, thereby making his Photographs more valuable
""probably after [he] die[s]."" Pl. Dep. 36:12-22. This argument is unpersuasive because the Supreme Court has recognized
that courts evaluating the fourth fair use factor should consider whether a particular use ""produce[s] a harm cognizable
under the Copyright Act."" Campbell 510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . For example, the Supreme Court inCampbell noted
that because ""there is no protectable derivative market for criticism,"" courts should not consider harm to the market for
parodies in evaluating the fourth fair use factor. /d. These principles, applied here, point persuasively to the conclusion that
future harm caused by lack of attribution should similarly be disregarded in evaluating the fourth fair use factor. As with the
derivative market for criticism, the Copyright Act does not provide an exclusive right to attribution. See 17 U.S.C. § 106
(listing six exclusive rights in copyrighted works, not including the right to attribution). 14 Accordingly, harm caused by lack of
attribution is not generally cognizable under the Copyright Act 12 and should not be considered in evaluating the fourth fair
use factor. 16

Even assuming arguendo, it is proper to consider harm from lack of attribution under the fourth factor, the factor still weighs
in favor of defendant because of this factor's overlap with the first fair use factor. The Fourth Circuit has made clear that ""
[w]hen the use is transformative, market substitution is at least less certain, and market harm may not be so readily
inferred."" Bouchat |_, 619 F.3d at 315 (quoting Campbell__510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). And ""when the use ‘is fora
noncommercial purpose, the likelihood of future market harm must be demonstrated’ by the copyright holder."" /d. (quoting
Sony , 464 U.S. at 451 , 104 S.Ct. 774 ) (internal quotation marks omitted). 12 Here, as

[279 F.Supp.3d 721]

described supra Section IV.A, defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs was both transformative and
essentially noncommercial. 18 Accordingly, market harm may not be readily inferred and must be demonstrated by the
copyright holder. Plaintiff, however, has failed to point to any record evidence of concrete market harm, referring only to
speculative future harm from a lack of attribution. Indeed, plaintiff's entire argument rests on his assertion that if he becomes
famous, his photographs will become more valuable someday, most likely after his death. See Pl. Dep. 36:12-22. 12 Plaintiff
has not suggested that he plans to remove his Chesney and Kid Rock photographs from Wikimedia or that he has plans to
sell the Photographs. Nor is there any evidence in the record to support plaintiff's contention that attribution will meaningfully
impact the value of his photographs. Such unfounded speculation cannot support a finding of a likelihood of market harm.
See A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye__ 562 F.3d at 645 (finding the fourth factor favored defendants where there was ""nothing in the
record to suggest that any of these scenarios envisioned by plaintiffs are anything more than unfounded speculation"").

In sum, there is nothing in this record to suggest there is currently any market for the Chesney or Kid Rock Photographs or
that any preparations have been made to establish or create a market. Any speculative economic effects on the future
market for plaintiff's Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs owing to a lack of attribution do not outweigh the lack of direct
economic effects and defendant's generally noncommercial use of the Photographs. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor
of finding a fair use.

Vv.

But this analysis does not end the inquiry because Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit precedent dictate that rather than
examining the fair use factors in isolation, courts must ""weigh[ ] [the results] together, in light of the purposes of copyright.""
Bouchat |_, 619 F.3d at 307 —08 (quoting Campbell__510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ) (internal quotation marks omitted). In
this regard, the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit have made clear that first and fourth factors are the most important. 2°
The second factor has limited weight where the challenged work is transformative and the first factor militates in favor of a
fair use finding. See

[279 F.Supp.3d 722]

Gaylord v. United States , 595 F.3d 1364 , 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 257 (2d Cir.
2006) (noting that ""the creative nature of a copyrighted work had limited weight in the fair use analysis because the
secondary work used the original ‘in a transformative manner....’""). And even where ""the entire work is reproduced,"" the
third factor ""does not have its ordinary effect of militating against a finding of fair use."" Sony Corp... 464 U.S. at 450 , 104
S.Ct. 774 .21

These principles, applied here, point persuasively to the conclusion that defendant's use of the Chesney and Kid Rock
Photographs constituted fair use. As discussed above, the undisputed factual record reveals that the first and fourth fair use
factors militate in favor of a fair use finding, the second factor is neutral at best, and the third factor weighs slightly against a
fair use finding. Given the paramount importance of the first and fourth factors, the limited weight of the second and third
factors when the work is transformative, and copyright's purpose to ""[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,"" 22
the facts alleged in this case make out a fair use defence as a matter of law. Accordingly, defendant's motion for summary
judgment must be granted. 23

An appropriate order will issue.

Notes:
117 U.S.C. § 107(1).

2 See also A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye v. iParadigms, LLC_, 562 F.3d 630 , 638 (4th Cir. 2009) (""A ‘transformative’ use is one that ‘employ[s] the quoted matter
in a different manner or for a different purpose from the original,’ thus transforming it."").

3 Despite plaintiff's deposition testimony that his purpose in taking the Photographs was to depict the artists in concert, Pl. Dep. 43:14-16, 75:4-6,
plaintiff subsequently filed an affidavit stating that his purpose in taking the Photographs was actually to ""clearly identify Chesney and Kid Rock for the
purpose of visually enhancing articles about the performers."" Pl. Decl. 4 13. This appears to be nothing more than a litigation tactic on plaintiff's part,
namely plaintiff is attempting to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendant's use of the Photographs was transformative by
changing his explanation for taking the Photographs to match the explanation for using the Photographs offered by defendant. But it is well settled that
where ""a party submits an affidavit that is inconsistent with a witness's deposition testimony, the contradictory affidavit is disregarded for purposes of
summary judgment."" Green v. Nat'l Archives & Records Admin.__992 F.Supp. 811 , 822 (E.D. Va. 1998) ; see also In Re Family Dollar FLSA Litig. . 637
F.3d 508 , 513 (4th Cir. 2011) (""If a party who has been examined at length on deposition could raise an issue of fact simply by submitting an affidavit
contradicting his own prior testimony, this would greatly diminish the utility of summary judgment as a procedure for screening out sham issues of fact.""
(quoting_Barwick v. Celotex Corp. , 736 F.2d 946 , 960 (4th Cir. 1984) )). Thus, plaintiff's inconsistent declaration cannot create a genuine dispute of
material fact concerning whether plaintiff captured the Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs to show the artists in concert.

Even assuming plaintiff's purpose in taking the Photographs was to enhance visually some unidentified future articles, defendant's use of the
Photographs would nonetheless be transformative because although defendant used the Photographs to identify Kid Rock and Kenny Chesney and to
enhance its articles, it did so for the additional purpose of identifying these celebrities as pro-life advocates and candidates for public office.

4 Indeed, plaintiff could not have had this purpose in mind because Kid Rock did not announce his plans to run for U.S. Senate until well after the

13 Congress plainly did not intend to preserve a market for copyright litigation when it enacted the Copyright Act so any impairment of the litigation market
for plaintiffs Chesney and Kid Rock Photographs has no bearing on this analysis. See Campbell__510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (considering only

neither apposite nor persuasive; the Jacobsen case did not involve a fair use determination so the opinion's dicta have no bearing on analysis of the
fourth factor in a fair use defense.

OPINION & ORDER
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

Plaintiff brings this action for copyright infringement alleging unauthorized use of a licensed photograph. Defendant moves to
dismiss. For the reasons given below, the motion is GRANTED.

|. BACKGROUND

The following facts are drawn from the allegations in Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, which are taken as true at this
stage of the litigation, as well attached exhibits and documents incorporated by reference. McCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet
Corp... 482 F.3d 184 , 191 (2d Cir. 2007) (in

[405 F.Supp.3d 541]

resolving a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), review is generally limited to ""the facts as asserted within the four corners
of the complaint, the documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and any documents incorporated in the complaint by
reference"").

In April of 2017, Plaintiff took a photograph of Dan Rochkind (the ""Photograph""). Dkt. No. 17 § 7. The Photograph was then
licensed to the New York Post, which ran an article on April 12, 2017 entitled Why / Don't Date Hot Women Anymore about
Rochkind and his dating life (the ""Post Article""). /d. § 8; Dkt. No. 17-2. The Post Article featured the Photograph. Dkt. No. 17
48. On or about April 13, 2017, Defendant posted an article entitled Twitter is skewering the ‘New York Post’ for a piece on
why a man ""won't date hot women"" (the ""Mic Article""). Dkt. No. 17-4. The Mic Article includes not the full Photograph, but
rather a screenshot of the Post Article, which includes the headline of the Post Article, the author's name and the date, and
roughly the top half of the photograph (the ""Screenshot""). /d. ; Dkt. No. 17 4 11-12. Defendant did not license the
Photograph, nor did it have Plaintiff's permission or consent to publish the Photograph. /d. § 13.

On August 21, 2018, Plaintiff brought this suit for copyright infringement. Dkt. No. 1. After Defendant filed a motion to
dismiss, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint. Dkt. No. 17. On December 5, 2018, Defendant filed the instant motion to
dismiss the amended complaint on the grounds that Defendant's use of the Photograph was protected by the fair use
doctrine. Dkt. No. 19.

Il. LEGAL STANDARD
A. Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6)

To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), the complaint must ""state a claim to relief that
is plausible on its face."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 , 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) . Aclaim
achieves ""facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference
that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d
868 (2009) . Plausibility is ""not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a
defendant has acted unlawfully,"" id. , and if plaintiffs cannot ""nudge[ ] their claims across the line from conceivable to
plausible, their complaint must be dismissed,"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 . ""Plausibility ... depends on a
host of considerations: the full factual picture presented by the complaint, the particular cause of action and its elements,
and the existence of alternative explanations so obvious that they render plaintiff's inferences unreasonable."" L-7 Designs
Inc. v. Old Navy, LLC , 647 F.3d 419 , 430 (2d Cir. 2011). When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), ""a
court must accept as true all of the [factual] allegations contained in [the] complaint[.]"" /qbal__556 U.S. at 678 , 129 S.Ct.



--- Page 2 ---
1937 . However, the court should not accept legal conclusions as true: ""[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of
action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice."" /d.

B. Fair Use

""[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work ... for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple
copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright."" 17 U.S.C. § 107. To determine
whether use of a work is fair, courts consider several factors: ""(1) the

[405 F.Supp.3d 542]

purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational
purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" /d.
; see Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. ,510 U.S. 569 , 577,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) . In considering
these factors, the ""ultimate test of fair use ... is whether the copyright law's goal of ‘promoting the Progress of Science and
useful Arts’ ... would be better served by allowing the use than by preventing it.""""Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 705 (2d
Cir. 2013) (quoting_Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v. Caro! Publ'g Grp., Inc. . 150 F.3d 132 , 141 (2d Cir. 1998) ).

Fair use is an affirmative defense, and therefore Defendant bears the burden of showing that a given use is fair. Authors
Guild v. Google. Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 213 (2d Cir. 2015). An affirmative defense may be ""may be adjudicated"" on a motion to
dismiss ""where the facts necessary to establish the defense are evident on the face of the complaint.""_Kelly-Brown v.
Winfrey , 717 F.3d 295 , 308 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing McKenna v. Wright , 386 F.3d 432 , 436 (2d Cir. 2004) ). Accordingly,
when ""the only two pieces of evidence needed to decide the question of fair use"" are ""the original version"" and the allegedly
infringing version, it is proper to decide the issue on a motion to dismiss._Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 707 (2d Cir. 2013)
; see also Clark v. Transp. Alts., Inc. , No. 18-cv-9985 (VM), 2019 WL 1448448, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2019) (dismissing
an infringement claim based on fair use defense on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion); May v. Sony Music Entm't, No. 18-cv-2238
(LAK), 2019 WL 2450973, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 13, 2019) (courts have adjudicated motions to dismiss based on a fair use
defense ""when discovery would not provide any additional relevant information and all that is necessary for the court to
make a determination as to fair use are the two works at issue"" (citing cases) (internal quotation marks and brackets
omitted)); Lombardo v. Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. , 279 F. Supp. 3d 497, 504 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), aff'd , 729 F. App'x 131 (2d
Cir. 2018) (""Numerous courts in this district have resolved the issue of fair use on a motion for judgment on the pleadings by
conducting a side-by-side comparison of the works at issue."").

Ill. DISCUSSION

Defendant moves to dismiss on the grounds that its use of the Photograph is protected by the fair use doctrine. For the
reasons given below, the Court concludes that it is possible to adjudicate this motion based solely on the two works at issue.
The Court analyzes each of the fair use factors in turn, while keeping in mind that the purpose of ""[t]he fair use doctrine is ...
to protect secondary works that ‘add[ ] value to the original,’ that use the original work ‘as raw material, transformed in
creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings.’ "" Oyewole v. Ora, 291 F. Supp. 3d 422, 433
(S.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 142 ).

A. Purpose and Character of Use

The first factor, ""purpose and character of use,"" involves three sub-factors, which involve determining whether the use is: (1)
transformative; (2) for commercial purposes; or (3) in bad faith. See NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst. 364 F.3d 471 , 477-78 (2d
Cir. 2004). However, if the new work is ""substantially transformative,"" the ""other factors, including commercialism, are of
less significance.""

[405 F.Supp.3d 543]

Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 254 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The Court examines
these sub-factors in turn and concludes that even drawing all available inferences in Plaintiff's favor, this factor strongly
favors a finding of fair use.

1. Defendant's Use of the Photograph Is Transformative

As to whether a secondary use is transformative, ""[t]he central purpose of this investigation is to see ... whether the new
work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation ... or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or
different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.""_Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510
U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). ""[C]opying from an
original for the purpose of criticism or commentary on the original or provision of information about it, tends most clearly to
satisfy Campbell's notion of the ‘transformative’ purpose involved in the analysis of Factor One."" Authors Guild__804 F.3d at
215 —16 (footnotes omitted). Thus, ""[d]isplay of a copyrighted image or video may be transformative where the use serves to
illustrate criticism, commentary, or a news story about that work."" Barcroft Media, Ltd. v. Coed Media Grp. , LLC , 297 F.
Supp. 3d 339, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). On the other hand, if a photograph is merely used as an ""illustrative aid"" that ""depict[s]



--- Page 3 ---
the subjects described in [an] article[ ],"" this does not constitute transformative use. /d. at 352.

Applying that standard, even drawing all available inferences in Plaintiff's favor, Mic's use of the Photograph was
transformative in three ways.

First, it is clear from the face of the Mic Article that it was using the Screenshot to identify the subject of controversy—the
Post Article—and to illustrate why the article has been controversial. Using a portion of an original work to identify and inform
viewers about the subject of a controversy can constitute transformative use. For example, a ""news report about a video that
has gone viral on the Internet might fairly display a screenshot or clip from that video to illustrate what all the fuss is about.""
Barcroft Media , LLC, 297 F. Supp. 3d at 352 (citing Konangataa v. Am. Broadcastingcompanies, Inc. , No. 16-CV-7382
(LAK), 2017 WL 2684067, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 21, 2017) ). Similarly, ""depiction of a controversial photograph"" could be fair
use as accompaniment to commentary about the controversy or criticism of the photograph. /d. (citing Nunez v. Caribbean
Int'l News Corp. , 235 F.3d 18 , 25 (1st Cir. 2000) ). This is the case here.

The title of the Mic Article, Twitter is skewering the ‘New York Post’ for a piece on why a man"" won't date hot women,""
immediately informs that the subject is the backlash to the Post Article. In a similar case involving a Post article, the fact that
the original photograph was not reproduced ""as a standalone image, but as part of [a] composite image that showed the
manner in which the Post Article's headline, author byline, and the Photograph were arranged on the Post's website
indicates that it is being used to identify the subject as the Post Article itself."" Clark , 2019 WL 1448448, at *3—-4. The Mic
Article itself consists in large part of embedded tweets criticizing the Post Article, the way the Post Article presents
Rochkind, and Rochkind himself. One of the embedded tweets, commenting on the Photograph, writes ""[sJorry ladies but
you just lost your chance with Mr. February from my Passably Hot Substitute Teachers calendar."" Dkt. 17-4 at 4. This not
only pokes fun at Rochkind as he is depicted in the Photograph,

[405 F.Supp.3d 544]

but also the idea that his opinions on ""hot women"" would be reported seriously in the way that the Post has done. Another
tweet, commenting on a different photo from the Post Article, states that the photo's ""caption is so savagely written[,] this has
to be a piece of satire."" Dkt. 17-4 at 5. In this context, the Photograph is used ""to illustrate what all the fuss is about,""
Barcroft Media , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 352, namely the Post Article and its depiction of Rochkind. This is a different use of the
Photograph than the Post's, which was ""news reporting on [Rochkind]."" Dkt. No. 22 at 10. To the extent that the Photograph
was used as part of the composite Screenshot to identify the Post Article itself, it indisputably constitutes a different use than
its original purpose.

Second, it is clear from the face of the Mic Article that it does more than just comment on the controversy; it uses the
Screenshot as part of its own criticism of the Post Article. In a recent case in which a blog used a composite screenshot of a
news article—as here, the composite included the headline of the article, the author byline, and the photograph at issue—to
criticize the original article, Judge Marrero held as a matter of law that this use was transformative as the photograph ""is no
longer just a depiction of a [the original subject] but a sly barb at the [original article's] sloppy journalism."" Clark , 2019 WL
1448448, at *3. Similarly, the Mic Article mocks the Post's presentation of the subject, using the Screenshot to both identify
the target of its criticism and as a basis for criticism. The Screenshot juxtaposes the photograph of an individual whose
appearance the article mocks with a headline sincerely proclaiming that this man ""won't date hot women,"" Dkt. 17-4 at 2-4,
as an attempt to ""emphasize[ ] the humorous incongruity of the Post's decision to run the Photograph"" in the way it did.
Clark , 2019 WL 1448448, at *3. The Mic Article goes on to criticize the Post Article in a number of other ways, mocking the
way the Post refers to Rochkind's fiancée as ""merely beautiful"" rather than ""hot,"" Dkt. No. 17-4 at 2, and launching jabs at
the Post for transmitting Rochkind's self-presentation at face value, id. (""The 40-year old Upper West Side resident humbly
told the Post there was a time when he could have anyone he wanted, which meant he always went after the ‘hottest girl you
could find.’ ""). Accordingly, ""the Photograph is no longer just a depiction of [the subject],"" but a vehicle for criticizing the Post
Article and identifying it as the target of this criticism. Clark , 2019 WL 1448448, at *3. This brand of ""[m]edia criticism is not
the same purpose as the Photograph was originally intended to be used."" /d. (quoting Barcroft Media , 297 F. Supp. 3d at
351-52 (internal quotation marks omitted)). In this manner, Defendant's use ""add[ed] something new, with a further purpose
or different character, altering the first [work] with new expression, meaning, or message."" /d. (quoting Campbell. 510 U.S.
at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (1994) ).

Third, on its face, the Mic Article uses the Photograph to place Rochkind in a harshly negative light, while the original use of
the Photograph placed him in a positive, or at least neutral light. ""In the context of news reporting and analogous activities""
and the ""reproduct[ion] [of] a work without alteration ... [clourts often find such uses transformative by emphasizing the
altered purpose or context of the work, as evidenced by surrounding commentary or criticism."" See Swatch Grp. Mgmt.
Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. , 756 F.3d 73 , 84 (2d Cir. 2014). Accordingly, several courts have held as a matter of law that
it is transformative to take a photograph initially used to simply identify someone or show them in a positive light

[405 F.Supp.3d 545]

and use it in a critical manner. See Katz v. Google Inc. . 802 F.3d 1178 , 1182-83 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that defendant's
""use of the Photo was transformative because, in the context of the blog post's surrounding commentary, [defendant] used
[plaintiff's] purportedly ‘ugly’ and ‘compromising’ appearance to ridicule and satirize his character""); Weinberg v. Dirty World,
LLC, No. 16-cv-9179 (GW), 2017 WL 5665023, at *5-10, 13 (C.D. Cal. July 27, 2017) (use of photo was transformative in



--- Page 4 ---
part because ""[rjather than using the photo to merely identify Plaintiff or his wife, as Plaintiff did on her Facebook profile
page ... the entire Post uses the Video Image as part of a direct critique on Plaintiff's wife's appearance, her status as a
model, her husband, and her relationship with her husband.""); Dhillon v. Does 1-10, No. 13-cv-01465 (Sl), 2014 WL
722592, at *3-6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2014) (use was transformative when picture was originally taken to depict plaintiff in a
positive light, then used ""as part of [defendant's] criticism of, and commentary on, the plaintiff's politics""). Even while this use
comes closest to the Post's original use of the Photograph—depicting Rochkind—using the Photograph to criticize Rochkind
is a refraining of the ""meaning[ ] or message"" of the work. Campbell__510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . In the original, the
posed photograph dominates the page, accompanied by text describing Rochkind as having ""had no problem snagging the
city's most beautiful women"" and praising his ""muscular build and a full head of hair."" Dkt. 17-2 at 2. A reasonable viewer
would interpret the Photograph in this context as placing Rochkind in a flattering, or at the very least neutral, light. In sharp
contrast, the Screenshot in the Mic Article shrinks the Photograph considerably, and places it alongside text in which this
""insufferable private equity executive"" is mocked for everything from his appearance to his personality. Dkt. No. 17-4 at 2-6.
This use alters the original message of the Photograph, dramatically altering the light in which it is framed and the message
it conveys.

None of Plaintiff's arguments to the contrary are availing. It is true that the unauthorized use of a licensed work is not
protected solely because the secondary work has a ""purpose or message"" that ""was different from that of the appropriated

material."" TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168 , 180 (2d Cir. 2016). Accordingly, simply reproducing a comedy
routine unaltered in a play that is a ""dark critique of society"" will not constitute fair use if the comedy routine itself does not
convey that ""dark critique."" /d. at 181. Here, however, the Photograph is itse/f being used to illustrate the controversy around
the Post Article, as satirical commentary on the Post's reporting, and to portray Rothkind in a different light. See Clark , 2019
WL 1448448, at *3. Each of these is a different purpose than the original.

In light of the above, even drawing all available inferences in Plaintiff's favor, it is implausible that Mic's use of the
Photograph was not transformative in the three ways described above. Given the importance of this sub-factor, it counts
heavily in favor of finding that the use was fair.

2. Defendant Used the Photograph for Commercial Benefit

Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is ""a for-profit media organization that derives substantial revenues from advertising on [its
website]"" and that Defendant used the Photograph to generate revenue by driving page views and clicks. Dkt. No. 17 § 22,
25. Accordingly, this sub-factor counts against finding fair use. However, when the use of the work was transformative,

[405 F.Supp.3d 546]

this factor is of ""less significance."" Blanch__467 F.3d at 254 .

3. Drawing All Reasonable Inferences in Plaintiff's Favor, it is Plausible that Defendant Acted in Bad Faith

Because fair use is an affirmative defense, it is Defendant's burden to show that it did not act in bad faith. At this stage,
absence of bad faith must therefore be ""evident on the face of the complaint."" Kelly-Brown__717 F.3d at 308 . This is not so
here, as viewing Plaintiff's allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Defendant cut off part of the Photograph,
removing the label crediting the work to Plaintiff. Dkt. No. 17 § 16-18; Dkt. 17-4 at 2. The intentional removal of a copyright
mark can ""suggest[ ] bad faith in defendant's use of plaintiff's work, and militate[ ] against a finding of fair us.""Rogers v.
Koons , 960 F.2d 301 , 309 (2d Cir. 1992). However, the Second Circuit has cautioned that bad faith is not ""itself conclusive
of the fair use question, or even of the first factor."" NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst. , 364 F.3d 471 , 479 (2d Cir. 2004). This sub-
factor thus counts somewhat in Plaintiff's favor.

B. Nature of the Work

Even drawing all available inferences in Plaintiff's favor, the second factor, the nature of the work, does not point strongly in
either direction. The Second Circuit has identified two sub-factors to consider: ""(1) whether the work is expressive or
creative, such as a work of fiction, or more factual, with a greater leeway being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work
is factual or informational, and (2) whether the work is published or unpublished, with the scope for fair use involving
unpublished works being considerably narrower."" Blanch__467 F.3d at 256 (citation omitted).

As to the first sub-factor, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that, while the Photograph is a relatively straightforward depiction of
Rochkind, as a posed portrait it ""evinces at least a modicum of artfulness, sufficient to designate it a ‘creative’ (rather than
‘factual’) work for the purposes of fair use analysis."" Clark , 2019 WL 1448448, at *4 (citing Authors Guild__804 F.3d at 220 ).
However, while ""[t]his classification cuts against a finding of fair use ... this factor ‘has rarely played a significant role in the
determination of a fair use dispute.’ "" Clark , 2019 WL 1448448, at *4 (quoting Authors Guild__804 F.3d at 220 ).

For the second sub-factor, it is evident from the face of the First Amended Complaint that the Photograph was previously
published when Defendant used it. Accordingly, the second sub-factor counts in Defendant's favor.

Given the above, even drawing all available inferences in his favor, the second factor counts only slightly in Plaintiff's favor, if
at all.


--- Page 5 ---
C. Amount and Substantiality

The third factor points towards a finding of fair use even when drawing all available inferences in Plaintiff's favor. In this
factor, a court will consider ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.""
17 U.S.C. § 107. The question is ""whether the quantity and value of the materials used[ ] are reasonable in relation to the
purpose of the copying."" Cariou__714 F.3d at 710 (quoting Blanch__467 F.3d at 257 ). The law ""does not require that the
secondary artist may take no more than is necessary"" and ""[t]he secondary use must be permitted to conjure up at least
enough of the original to fulfill its transformative purpose."" /d. (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). And if copying
the original ""any less

[405 F.Supp.3d 547]

would [make] the picture useless to the story[,]"" the substantiality of the copying is ""of little consequence."" Nunez v.
Caribbean Int'l News Corp. , 235 F.3d 18 , 24 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing Amsinck v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. , 862 F.Supp.
1044 , 1050 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) ).

Here, Defendant used a significantly cropped version of the Photograph as part of a Screenshot including the Post Article's
headline. Dkt. 17-4 at 2. Even drawing all available inferences in Plaintiff's favor, it is implausible that this was not a
reasonable use of the Photograph to achieve the purpose of both identifying the object of controversy and satirizing the Post
Article and Rochkind. See Cariou__714 F.3d at 710 .

Plaintiff offers a number of alternatives that he claims would have been less infringing. Even drawing all reasonable
inferences in his favor, none of these are convincing. Plaintiff contends that ""Defendant could have published its news story
with only the Twitter embeds, showing multiple instances of the Photograph and perfectly illustrating both the Twitter
reaction and Mr. Rochkind himself."" Dkt No. 22 at 21. However, the secondary work is not required to use only the absolute
minimum of the original work necessary. See Cariou__714 F.3d at 710 . The use of the Screenshot in the Mic Article's
headline identified the Post Article as the subject, and it is not plausible that Mic could have achieved the same effect by
burying the lede in embedded tweets.

The other alternatives are similarly implausible. Plaintiff offers that Defendant could have shared or commented on the
original story, presumably without writing their own. But it would not be reasonable to infer that this would be a replacement
for an entire article and accompanying embedded tweets. Requiring Defendant to ""publish[ ] its news story without any photo
whatsoever,"" Dkt No. 22 at 21, would not be enough to achieve the transformative effect, for the reasons given above. If
""Defendant ... commissioned its own photographer to take an original photo of Rochkind,"" id. , this would fail to produce an
image that identifies the Post Article. See Clark , 2019 WL 1448448, at *4. Similarly, since Defendant uses the Photograph
as part of a Screenshot to identify the Post Article itself, even drawing all available inferences in Plaintiff's favor, it is
implausible that licensing the standalone Photograph would serve the same purpose. /d. (""The Screenshot showed the
Photograph as used in the context of the Post Article"" and accordingly ""a licensed standalone image would [not] have
accomplished the [transformative] purpose"").

D. Potential Effect of the Use on the Market or Value

Finally, even drawing all available inferences in Plaintiff's favor, the fourth factor counts in Defendant's favor as well. ""When
a secondary use competes in the rightsholder's market as an effective substitute for the original, it impedes the purpose of
copyright to incentivize new creative works by enabling their creators to profit from them."" Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi
Inc. , 910 F.3d 649 , 662 (2d Cir. 2018). The Second Circuit recently noted that the Supreme Court has described this factor
as ""undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use."" /d. (quoting Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enterprises , 471 U.S. 539 , 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) ). This factor ""focuses on whether the copy brings
to the marketplace a competing substitute for the original, or its derivative, so as to deprive the rights holder of significant
revenues because of the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original.""

[405 F.Supp.3d 548]

Id. (quoting TVEyes_, 883 F.3d at 179 ). This inquiry ""is necessarily intertwined with Factor One; the more the objective of
secondary use differs from that of the original, the less likely it will supplant the commercial market for the original."" /d. (citing
Google Books., 804 F.3d at 223 ).

Here, even assuming there were a market in licensing the Photograph and drawing all available inferences in Plaintiff's
favor, it is implausible that such a market would be supplanted by Defendant's use. As noted above, the Photograph does
not appear on its own in the Mic Article, but as part of a composite Screenshot including the Post Article's headline, the
author's byline, and the date and time. In light of the cropped and composite manner in which the Mic Article presents the
Photograph, it is implausible that potential purchasers would opt to use the Screenshot rather than license the original
Photograph. As in Clark , a screenshot of this kind ""does not function as an illustration of"" Rochkind, ""because it also
contains the Post Article's headline [and] author byline."" Clark , 2019 WL 1448448, at *4. Thus, ""the Screenshot does not
compete against the Photograph in the enterprise of depicting [Rochkind]—there is little risk that someone looking to license
or purchase an image of [Rochkind] would select the Screenshot instead of the Photograph, thereby potentially diverting
revenue to [Mic] that would have otherwise gone to [Yang]. /d. (citing Capito! Records__910 F.3d at 662-63 ). Indeed, the



--- Page 6 ---
argument here is even stronger than in Clark. Here the Photograph was cropped significantly in size, while in Clark the
entire original was used. /d. at *3. Accordingly, even drawing all available inferences in Plaintiff's favor, it is not plausible the
Screenshot would supplant the market—if any—for licensing the Photograph.

E. The Totality of the Factors

In light of the above factors, even drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, it is evident on the face of the First
Amended Complaint that Defendant's use was fair as a matter of law. Defendant's use was transformative, its use was
reasonable in light of that end, the work was already published, and there is no plausible risk to any market for licensing of
the original work. This is sufficient to make out an affirmative defense of fair use at the motion to dismiss stage.

Because Defendant prevails on the issue of fair use, it is unnecessary to reach the question of whether Plaintiff adequately
alleged willfulness.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the reasons given above, the Court hereby GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss. Plaintiff has already amended its
claims once in response to Defendant's initial motion, which pressed the same arguments as those raised here. Dkt. No. 12.
Moreover, Plaintiff has not requested an opportunity to amend nor stated what amendments, if any, he would seek to make.
For those reasons, this dismissal is with prejudice. See Gallop v. Cheney , 642 F.3d 364 , 369 (2d Cir. 2011). This resolves
docket item number 19. The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment and close the case.

SO ORDERED.

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS
McMahon, United States District Judge:

Plaintiff Lindsey Grace Whiddon (""Whiddon"") brings this claim of copyright infringement against Defendant Buzzfeed
Inc. (""Buzzfeed"").

[638 F.Supp.3d 346]

Plaintiff is a professional photographer. She took multiple photographs of her friend, social media ""influencer"" Tiffany
Mitchell, before and after a motorcycle accident. Ms. Mitchell created an Instagram post about her accident, which featured
these photographs.

On or about August 19, 2019, Defendant published an article about Ms. Mitchell, specifically about an emerging online
controversy about her Instagram post. Embedded within the article were multiple screenshots of Ms. Mitchell's Instagram
post, displaying Whiddon's photographs. Plaintiff alleges that, by reproducing three of her photographs without permission,
Defendant infringed her copyright in the photographs pursuant to Section 501 of the Copyright Act, 17. U.S.C. § 501 et seq.
(Count I).

Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiffs complaint in its entirety, with prejudice, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), or in
the alternative, for summary judgement pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d), asserting that its use of all three photos constitutes
fair use.

Because Defendant was obviously entitled to reproduce the photographs, Buzzfeed's motion to dismiss the Amended
Complaint is GRANTED.

I. BACKGROUND
A. The Parties

Plaintiff Lindsay Grace Whiddon is a professional photographer. She is a citizen of the State of Tennessee and
maintains a principal place of business at 6203A California Avenue, in Nashville, Tennessee. (Am. Compl. at 4 6).

Defendant Buzzfeed is a Delaware corporation. (Am. Compl. at 6). Its principal place of business is 111 East 18 ""
Street, New York, New York. Defendant is the owner and operator of a website known as www.buzzfeednews.com (the
""Website"") and an account on the social media website Facebook known as @BuzzFeed (the ""Account"") located at
www.facebook.com. (Am. Compl. at §§ 3-4. The Account is followed by 13 million users of Facebook. (Am. Compl. at 15).
Defendant is a ""popular and lucrative commercial enterprise,"" and is paid to run sponsored and paid advertisements on the
Website and Account. (Am. Compl. at { 15, 18, 22). Defendant also sells merchandise on the Website to users of the
Website. (Am. Compl. at 23).

B. Photographs and Subsequent Article

On or about July 28, 2019, Whiddon took three photographs of her friend, Nashville-based lifestyle blogger Tiffany
Mitchell, (""Photographs""). One of the photos showed Mitchell posing in front of a motorcycle (""Pre-Accident Photograph""),
(Am. Compl. at § 24; Am. Compl. Ex. 1), and the two others showed her being cared for in the aftermath of a motorcycle
accident (""Post-Accident Photographs""). (Am. Compl. at {§ 33, 39; Am. Compl. Ex. 1). On July 31, 2019, Mitchell posted
these Photographs, among others, to her Instagram. (Am. Compl. Ex. 3, 1). This posting apparently generated a great deal
of controversy on social media.

On or about August 19, 2019, Defendant published an article (""Article"") on the Website, entitled ""An Influencer Is
Defending Her Decision to Post a Photo Shoot Of Her Motorcycle Accident on Instagram,"" authored by ""social news
reporter"" Tanya Chen. The Article was about Ms. Mitchell's motorcycle accident and the controversy surrounding her social
media post about the accident. (Am. Compl. Ex. 3). The text of the Article reads as follows:


--- Page 2 ---
A lifestyle blogger based in Nashville is answering to critics who questioned why
[638 F.Supp.3d 347]
she turned her scary motorcycle accident into an impromptu photo shoot.

Tiffany Mitchell, who has over 211,000 followers on Instagram, told BuzzFeed News she ""would never turn a very
important personal story like this into a brand campaign.""

""I'm sad that some people are taking it that way,"" she added, before requesting BuzzFeed News not proceed with
writing this story as it would ""draw negative attention.""

Mitchell shared the post two weeks ago after she got into a motorcycle accident that left her shaken and with
minor scrapes. A photographer friend was driving alongside taking photos of her at the time. The friend, named
Lindsey, then continued to snap photos during and after the traumatic event.

All of these photos — including some of Mitchell lying on the road being tended to, and one with a bottle of
Smartwater — were then shared in a series of Instagram photos accompanied by a lengthy caption.

Mitchell described the incident as ""unreal,"" and described a scene where after she was thrown off her bike,
strangers tended to her and helped load her bike on a trailer.

""We all drove back to my house with a green light from angels that cleaned me up in the ambulance, sat with our
new friends listening to music and laughing until | fell asleep,"" she wrote.

She wrote that she lost a partner to a motorcycle accident three years ago, so the accident especially affected
her.

""I'm resting and healing up my arm, and @ianwhitetattoos may need to touch up my wildflowers, but | am feeling
so much better,"" she concluded the long caption.

A lot of people sent her well wishes and flooded her comments with warm thoughts. (Mitchell has since archived
the post after more negative comments began rolling in.)

However, the comments then became mixed with more critical and cynical observations. For one, people were
taken aback by the optics of taking, and then sharing, professional-grade photos of her actual accident.

""This must have been super scary and I'm glad you're okay, but . . . if my friend continued to take photos while |
was lying semi-unconscious in the road, I'd be furious, | love your photos but it's a little weird to include those,""
one wrote.

""How are people commenting on this like it's normal?"" another wrote.

Some even accused her of posing for them.

To those accusations, Mitchell said that's simply not true.

""Nothing about this was staged. I'm sad that some people are taking it that way, but it's just not the case,"" she
said.

""| didn't know she was taking them, but later on when she showed them to me | was so grateful that she captured
such an intense moment for me.""

The post also made its way to Reddit's /r/blogsnark subreddit, where one user wrote, ""Genuinely | am perplexed
by the idea of a friend snapping angles right next to your head post-motorcycle crash. What the fuck?!""

Her followers then began to question if the bottle of Smartwater was intentionally placed beside her as she was
lying on the pavement. ""Paid in partnership with Smartwater . . ."" one commenter said cheekily.

Mitchell denied any paid or branded deal with the water company. Smartwater later confirmed to BuzzFeed
News

[638 F.Supp.3d 348]
that they do not have a partnership with her.

""| would never turn a very important personal story like this into a brand campaign,"" she stated, adding that ""the
water was given to me while | was resting.""


--- Page 3 ---
Mitchell maintains the post was well-intended.
""All motives for taking the photos and sharing them along with the details of the experience were good,"" she said.

""I'm really sad that raising this topic without all the context may inspire negativity and hatred, but | did my best
and hope whatever happens can add to people's lives in some way.""

(Id.)

At several points in the article, screenshots of Ms. Mitchell's Instagram post (""Post"") are embedded between
paragraphs of the Article's text. The screenshots of the Post are composed of two distinct panels, The left panel of each
screenshot displays a different photograph from the Post, including each of the three Photographs. The right panel of each
screenshot displays the caption that Ms. Mitchell wrote to accompany the Post, with each screenshot displaying a different
portion of the caption so that the entire caption may be read. The Article also features screenshots of comments left by
Instagram users on the Post. All of the screenshots are credited to ""Instagram.com"" or ""Instagram"".

On or about August 30, 2019, Whiddon first saw the Photographs on the Website, featured in the Article. (Am. Compl.
at 94 27, 36, 42). On or about September 5, 2019, Whiddon applied to the U.S. Copyright Office (""USCO"") to register each
of the Photographs, under Application Numbers 1-8040359721. (Am. Compl. at 4 25, 34, 40). 4On or about September 17,
2019, USCO determined that the Photographs qualified for registration, and were registered under Registration No. VA 2-
169-496, effective September 5, 2019. (Am. Compl. at §§ 26, 35, 41; Am. Compl. Ex. 4, 1).

On or about July 18, 2022, Whiddon again saw the Pre-Accident Photograph, displayed on the Account. The Account's
post was dated from three years earlier - August 20, 2019, the time when the Article was published, (Am. Compl. at § 30).

The Complaint alleges that (1) Whiddon did not grant permission, authorize, or otherwise assign any of her exclusive
rights in the Photographs to the Defendant. (Am. Compl. at § 47), (2) Plaintiff believes each of the screenshots features
exact copies of the entirety or majority of the original Photographs, (Am. Compl. at § 50), (3) the Defendant controls the
content posted on Website and Account, (Am. Compl. at 451), (4) the Photographs were posted by employees of the
Defendant and not at the direction of a user of the Website or social media website Facebook. (Am. Compl. at 53-54;
56). Plaintiff believes the display of the Photographs increased the number of individuals visiting Website and Account, for a
period of time, causing Defendant to realize an increase in advertising revenue and/or merchandise sales. (Am. Compl. at J
61). A number of major media outlets also published the Photographs and the story of the controversy on their own
websites, providing credit to the Defendant, not to the Plaintiff. (Am. Compl. at { 66). To date, Defendant has not removed
the Photographs from Website or Account. (Am. Compl. at ¥ 68).

[638 F.Supp.3d 349]
C. Procedural History

Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on June 6, 2022, alleging one count of copyright infringement pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 501.
(Dkt. No. 1). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on July 8, 2022. (Dkt. No. 12).

Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint as of right pursuant Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B) on July 22, 2022. (Dkt. No. 18).
In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff withdrew her claim of copyright infringement as to the ""SmartWater Photograph"",
(PI. Opp. 7, Dkt. No. 26) and provided additional exhibits. (Dkt. No. 18).

Defendant again filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted on July 29, 2022.
(Dkt. No. 20). Defendant argues for dismissal or, in the alternative, summary judgement pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d), on
the sole ground that its use of the Photographs is a prima facie case of fair use. (Def. Mot. to Dismiss 1, Dkt. No. 21).

Il. DISCUSSION
A. Standard for a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss

To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, ""a complaint must contain sufficient factual
matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v . Iqbal__556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129
S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp . v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 , 570,127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167
L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) ). ""[A]ll reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of the plaintiff,"" but the ""complaint must contain
sufficient allegations to nudge a claim ‘across the line from conceivable to plausible.’ "" Sphere Digital, LLC v . Armstrong ,
No. 20-cv-4313 (CM), 2020 WL 6064156, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 2020) (quoting Twombly. 550 U.S. at 555 , 127 S.Ct.
1955 ). Where a plaintiff fails to ""nudge[ ] their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be
dismissed."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 . Federal Rule 12(b)(6) ""does not impose a probability requirement
at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of""
the truth of the allegations. /d. at 545,127 S.Ct. 1955 .

In reviewing a motion to dismiss, a court may consider, inter alia, (1) documents that are incorporated by reference into
the complaint, and (2) documents that, even if not incorporated by reference, the defendant has notice of and that are
‘integral’ to the complaint"" without converting the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment. BankUnited ,N.A.v

B. Buzzfeed's Use of the Photographs is Fair Use

As the Supreme Court has explained, the overriding purpose of copyright is "" '[t]lo promote the Progress of Science and
useful Arts ... .'"" Campbell v . Acuff-Rose Music , Inc .,510 U.S. 569 , 574, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)
(quoting U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 8). The Copyright Act advances this purpose by permitting the public to draw upon
copyright materials without the permission of the copyright holder in certain circumstances. See 17 U.S.C. § 107. Section
107 requires a court to consider the following four nonexclusive factors, which are to be weighed together, to assess
whether a particular use is fair:

1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

2. The nature of the copyrighted work;
3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
Id .""The determination of fair use is a mixed question of fact and law,""Swatch Grp . Mgmt. Serv. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L . P .,

756 F.3d 73 , 83 (2d Cir. 2014), and is an ""open-ended and context-sensitive inquiry.""Blanch v . Koons., 467 F.3d 244 , 251
(2d Cir. 2006).

Fair use is an affirmative defense, so Defendant bears the burden of showing that a given use is fair. Authors Guild v .
Google , Inc ., 804 F.3d 202 , 213 (2d Cir. 2015). Courts may adjudicate an affirmative defense on a motion to dismiss
""where the facts necessary to establish the defense are evident on the face of the complaint."" Kelly-Brown v . Winfrey. 717
F.3d 295 , 308 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing McKenna v . Wright._386 F.3d 432 , 436 (2d Cir. 2004)).

""Accordingly, when 'the only two pieces of evidence needed to decide the question of fair use’ are 'the original version’
and the allegedly infringing version, it is proper to decide the issue on a motion to dismiss."" Yang v . Mic Network , Inc ., 405
F. Supp. 3d 537, 542 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (citing Cariou v . Prince. 714 F.3d 694 , 707 (2d Cir. 2013)); See also Clark v. Transp
. Alts ., Inc ., No. 18-cv-9985 (VM), 2019 WL 1448448, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2019). And while Defendants bear the
burden of proving that their use was fair, ""they need not establish that each of the factors set forth in § 107 weighs in their
favor."" NXIVM Corp .v. Ross Inst ., 364 F.3d 471 , 476-77 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted).

i. Defendant's Reporting on the Online Controversy was Transformative

The first statutory factor, the purpose and character of the use, is ""the heart of the fair use inquiry."" Blanch v . Koons.
467 F.3d 244 , 251 (2d Cir. 2006). As a result, if the new work is ""substantially transformative,"" the ""other factors, including
commercialism, are of less significance."" /d . Courts within the Second Circuit examine at least two sub-factors to determine
the purpose and character of use, whether the secondary use is: (1) transformative; and (2) for commercial purposes. See
NXIVM Corp .v. Ross Inst ., 364 F.3d at 478 .

For a secondary use to be ""transformative"" it must ""add something new, with a further purpose or different character,
altering the first with new expression, meaning or message[.]"" Cariou v . Prince__714 F.3d at 705 (quoting Campbell v .
Acuff-Rose Music , Inc ., 510 U.S. 569 ,

[638 F.Supp.3d 351]

579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ). The Copyright Act suggests that the display of a copyrighted image may be
transformative ""where the use serves to illustrate criticism, commentary, or a news story about that work."" Barcroft Media ,
Ltd. v. Coed Media Grp ., LLC , 297 F. Supp. 3d 339, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 107) (emphasis in original).
There is a strong presumption that the first factor favors a defendant if the allegedly infringing use is for one of those
purposes, NX/VM Corp .v. Ross Inst ., 364 F.3d at 477 ( citing Wright v. Warner Books , Inc ., 953 F.2d 731 , 736 (2d Cir.
1991)), but not if the use is merely to provide an illustrative aid depicting a person or event described in the writing. Barcroft

Inc., 196 F. Supp. 3d 395, 404-405 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).

As a result, courts have found transformative a reporter's use of a screenshot of a controversial online article to
accompany a critique of the article, Yang v . Mic Network , Inc ., 405 F. Supp. 3d 537, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), a news outlet's
broadcast of a sensational video clip in a news report about the video, Konangataa v . Am. Broadcasting Companies , Inc .,
No. 16-CV-7382 (LAK), 2017 WL 2684067, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 21, 2017), and a newspaper's ""depiction of a controversial
photograph"" alongside commentary about the controversy caused the photograph. Nunez v . Caribbean Int'l News Corp .,
235 F.3d 18 , 23 (1st Cir. 2000).

Buzzfeed argues that its use of the three Photographs is transformative, because the Photographs help to explain a
controversy involving Ms. Mitchell's social media post, and the Photographs contained therein. (Def. Mot. to Dismiss 11, Dkt.
No. 21). Buzzfeed's Article reports on the negative comments that Ms. Mitchell's social media post triggered, the critique of
the post and Photographs as ""staged,"" and the allegations that the post was sponsored by a corporation, SmartWater. /d. It
contends that the full reproductions of the Photographs, embedded within the larger screenshots of the Post, were part of a
news commentary that should be considered fair use. Id.

Upon review of the three Photographs, and even drawing all reasonable inferences in Ms. Whiddon's favor, Buzzfeed
has persuaded the Court that its use of the Photographs is transformative. Therefore, the factor favors Buzzfeed.

The Defendant reproduced the Photographs in the context of its report on the controversy that had arisen around Ms.
Mitchell's social media post. That is a far different purpose than the one for which the Plaintiff took the pictures or Ms.
Mitchell used them. Ms. Whiddon took the Photographs for their contents, to depict Ms. Mitchell and her later motorcycle
accident. Ms. Mitchell's Instagram Post depicts the story of her accident. But Buzzfeed reported on the resulting online
controversy over Ms. Mitchell's Post, and presented the screenshots of the Post, which included the Photographs, so
readers could consider whether the motorcycle accident appeared staged and/or the product of an advertising partnership.
""Defendant's inclusion of the Photograph as part of the Post was not simply to ‘present the content of that image.'"" Walsh v.
Townsquare Media , Inc ., 464 F. Supp. 3d 570, 583 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), reconsideration denied, 565 F. Supp. 3d 400
(S.D.N.Y. 2021) (quoting Gossip Cop Media , Inc ., 196 F. Supp. 3d at 407). Buzzfeed's use of the Photographs informed
readers and prompted them to consider whether Ms. Mitchell's Post and her accident were inauthentic.

[638 F.Supp.3d 352]

Defendant's Article explains the online controversy around Ms. Mitchell's Instagram post: initially Ms. Mitchell's Post
received comments of support, but soon comments became more cynical, and Ms. Mitchell became the target of significant
public criticism and accusations. The Article intersperses various screenshots of the controversial Post and Instagram users’
comments throughout the commentary. The screenshots of the Post juxtapose the Photographs with Ms. Mitchell's narrative
of the motorcycle accident. The Instagram comments illustrate the public reaction. By presenting the two sides of this
controversy through the screenshots, the reader understands why the public is reacted to the Post as it did. The
screenshots of the Post and Photographs then enhance the ability of the reader to understand the text, Bill Graham Archives
v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd ., 448 F.3d 605 , 609 (2d Cir. 2006), and allow the reader to form an opinion on the Post.

The author could not have simply reproduced the negative comments, as the comments alone would not have
explained why the Instagram users felt the way they did. In one case, a user comments, ""Huh? You had a serious accident
but people were there to take *~stunning*~ photos? This is an insult to people who get into accidents. Put a helmet on.""
(Compl. Ex. 3, 3). The reader understands why the commentator accuses Ms. Mitchell of glamorizing motorcycle accidents
with the Photographs, because they can see the ""stunning"" Photographs and Ms. Mitchell's accompanying narrative. No
other images could serve the same purpose as the screenshots in the Post, Walsh v. Townsquare Media , Inc ., 464 F.
Supp. 3d 570, 583 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), reconsideration denied, 565 F. Supp. 3d 400 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (citing Clark v.
Transportation Alternatives , Inc ., 2019 WL 1448448, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)).

Courts in this Circuit have specifically considered whether reporting on a controversial social media post is a sufficiently
transformative purpose to make a full reproduction of the post and its copyrighted material fair use. When an individual's
decision to disseminate an Instagram post is the ""very thing the article [is] reporting on,"" the use of the Instagram post and
its copyrighted material in the reporting has been deemed sufficiently transformative to support a fair use defense. Walsh v .
Townsquare Media , Inc ., 464 F. Supp. 3d 570, 581 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), reconsideration denied, 565 F. Supp. 3d 400
(S.D.N.Y. 2021); Boesen v . United Sports Publications , Ltd., No. 20CV1552ARRSIL, 2020 WL 6393010, at *4 (E.D.N.Y.
Nov. 2, 2020), reconsideration denied, No. 20CV1552ARRSIL, 2020 WL 7625222 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2020).

Moreover, reproductions of a social media post are clearly used for the purposes of reporting on the post where, as
here, the reproductions include the accompanying elements of the social media application, such as the frame of the
Instagram application and standard Instagram hyperlinks. Walsh , 464 F. Supp. 3d at 583-84. The focus of the article is Ms.
Mitchell's decision to disseminate the Photographs of her accident, and the resulting critique of that decision. Buzzfeed's use
of screenshots, which include all the elements of the Post, such as the Instagram branding and Ms. Mitchell's caption, make
absolutely clear that the focus of its reporting is on the Post and the controversy.

Plaintiff argues that the use of the Photographs is not transformative because she believes one photograph is used


--- Page 6 ---
only for a descriptive purpose and the other two are not related to the controversy. Plaintiff claims that the use of the Pre-
Accident Photograph is only descriptive, to show Ms. Mitchell before the accident. (PI. Opp.

[638 F.Supp.3d 353]

16-17). Plaintiff also contends that the subject of the online controversy was whether Ms. Mitchell staged the accident in the
Post for a sponsored advertisement with SmartWater. /d. at 17. Having withdrawn her claim for copyright infringement on
the photo prominently featuring the SmartWater bottle, she claims that the remaining two Post-Accident Photographs, which
do not prominently feature a SmartWater product, serve no function in a commentary on the controversy. /d. at 17-18.

These arguments are not persuasive. The Pre-Accident Photograph is the first photograph in the Post. The Defendant
did not merely use the Pre-Accident Photograph as a generic image of Ms. Mitchell, just to accompany the Article, BWP
Media USA , Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media , Inc ., 196 F. Supp. 3d 395, 407 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). Rather, the Pre-Accident
Photograph provides the reader with insight into the aesthetic choices of the earlier, staged photoshoot. The juxtaposition
with the Post-Accident Photographs allows the reader to consider whether the later photographs appear to be a continuation
of the photoshoot and to assess the credibility of Ms. Mitchell's comments that they were not staged.

The topic of the controversy is also not limited to the whether the Post was sponsored by Smartwater. The Article is
titled ""An Influencer Is Defending Her Decision To Post a Photoshoot Of Her Motorcycle Accident on Instagram."" The
Article's reporting on the allegations that the social media post was sponsored by SmartWater is limited to a few sentences
of the whole article. The bulk of the article is devoted to remarks by Ms. Mitchell and comments by Instagram users,
criticizing the Plaintiff's choice to take photographs after the accident, questioning the sensitivity of seeming to glamorize a
motorcycle accident, and alleging that Ms. Mitchell staged the Post-Accident photographs. As a result, the Post-Accident
Photographs are perfectly appropriate to help explain why critics are making those accusations.

In short, the use of all three Photographs is necessary and appropriate for reporting on the controversy.

Finally, Plaintiff emphasizes that Defendant is a ""popular and lucrative commercial enterprise,"" and contends that the
Defendant profited from the publishing of her Article and replication of Plaintiffs Photographs.

""The fact that a publication was commercial as opposed to nonprofit is a separate factor that tends to weigh against a
finding of fair use."" See Swatch Grp. Mgmt . Serv. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L . P.., 756 F.3d 73 , 83 (2d Cir. 2014).; Harper &
Row. 471 U.S. 539 , 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . However as, ""[a]lmost all newspapers, books and
magazines are published by commercial enterprises that seek a profit,"" courts discount this consideration where the link
between commercial gain and the copying is attenuated. Swatch, 756 F.3d at 83 (quoting Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. v
. Gen. Signal Corp ., 724 F.2d 1044 , 1049 (2d Cir. 1983)). Moreover, when the use of copyrighted material is highly
transformative, a defendant's use of copyrighted material for profit bears less weight. Blanch__467 F.3d at 254 .

Here, Plaintiff claims that the Defendant's article prompted a greater number of people to visit its Website, causing an
increase in revenue from advertising and merchandise sales. However, by Plaintiff's own description, Defendant is a
""popular and lucrative commercial enterprise"" and its Account is followed by 13 million Facebook users, so it is doubtful that
the copying of the Photographs led to any appreciable change in revenue from advertising

[638 F.Supp.3d 354]

contracts or made readers of the Article more inclined to purchase the Defendant's merchandise. However, that raises a
question of fact. What does not raise a question of fact is that Defendant's use of the Photographs was transformative, which
outweighs the commercial nature of the use - even if Defendant could be shown to have profited specifically from the
Photos' publication.

ii. The Photographs are Creative

The second statutory factor favors the Plaintiff, but not decidedly so. This factor, ""the nature of the copyrighted work,""
""calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with the
consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied."" Campbell v . Acuff-Rose Music ,
Inc ., 510 U.S. 569 , 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) . Courts have generally adopted two types of distinctions
in their analysis of the second factor: (1) whether the work is expressive or creative, such as a work of fiction, or more
factual with a greater leeway being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work is factual or informational, and (2) whether
the work is published or unpublished, with the scope for fair use involving unpublished works being considerably narrower.
Blanch v . Koons., 467 F.3d 244 , 257 (2d Cir. 2006).

""Photographic images of actual people, places and events may be as creative and deserving of protection as purely
fanciful creations."" Monster Communications , Inc . v. Turner Broadcasting, 935 F. Supp. 490 , 494 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).
However, courts traditionally have also afforded this factor little weight, characterizing it as ""rarely [ ] determinative."" On
Davis v. The Gap , Inc ., 246 F.3d 152 , 175 (2d Cir. 2001); accord Authors Guild , Inc. v.. HathiTrust._755 F.3d 87 , 102
(2d Cir. 2014); Hirsch v. CBS Broad. Inc ., No. 17 CIV. 1860 (PAE), 2017 WL 3393845, at “6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2017)

The Photographs of Ms. Mitchell clearly demonstrate features of creativity. The Pre-Accident Photograph displays Ms.


--- Page 7 ---
Mitchell in a posed position, with light and shadow incorporated in specific ways. The Post-Accident Photographs showcase
the emotion and drama of the motorcycle accident through manipulation of the camera focus and the capture of the accident
at multiple angles. This Court need not accept Ms. Mitchell's contentions that the Photographs were not staged, nor reach
any conclusion at all about the veracity of the social media post; the Photographs are expressive and display creativity.
However, under these circumstances, the Court assigns this second statutory factor much less heft than the first.

iii. Defendant's Reproduction was Reasonable for its Transformative Purpose

Substantively, the third factor considers ""whether the quantity and value of the materials used, are reasonable in
relation to the purpose of the copying."" Blanch v . Koons_, 467 F.3d 244 , 257 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Campbell v . Acuff-

Rose Music , Inc ., 510 U.S. 569 , 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ). This inquiry focuses, not on how much of
the secondary work comprises the original, but on the proportion of the work used, whether the defendant used more than

was necessary, and the ""purported justifications"" for the use. HathiTrust._755 F.3d at 96 . A secondary work may copy the
original in its totality where a full copy is reasonably appropriate to the secondary work's transformative purpose. Authors
Guild v . Google , Inc ., 804 F.3d 202 , 221 (2d Cir. 2015).

For many of the same reasons discussed earlier, this factor favors Buzzfeed.
[638 F.Supp.3d 355]

Buzzfeed used the entirety of the Photographs. Plaintiff argues that Buzzfeed did not need to use the three Photographs in
controversy, because only the photograph displaying the SmartWater bottle was necessary to comment on the controversy
about whether the Post was sponsored by SmartWater.

However, as mentioned, the Article is about more that the accusation that the Post was sponsored. It discusses the
accusations that the Post and Photographs appeared staged, and criticisms that the Post displayed a subject as serious as a
motorcycle accident in an artistic or even glamorous manner. Buzzfeed could not have displayed anything less than the
entirety of the Photographs, nor edited the Screenshots to reduce the visible portions of the Photographs. Reducing the
amount of the original work would have provided an incomplete description of the controversy, or even misrepresented the
Post. ""In the context of news reporting and analogous activities . . . the need to convey information to the public accurately
may . . . make it desirable and consonant with copyright law for a defendant to faithfully reproduce an original work without
alteration."" Swatch Grp . Mgmt . Servs . Ltd. v. Bloomberg L . P ., 756 F.3d 73 , 84 (2d Cir. 2014). The entirety of each
Photograph in the Post was necessary to provide the full context of the subject of the controversy. Accordingly, the third
factor favors Buzzfeed.

iv . Defendant's Use Did Not Compete with the Plaintiff's Work

The fourth statutory factor, the ""effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work,"" looks
to ""whether the copy brings to the marketplace a competing substitute for the original, or its derivative, so as to deprive the
rights holder of significant revenues because of the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in
preference to the original."" Capitol Records , LLC v . ReDigi Inc ., 910 F.3d 649 , 662 (2d Cir. 2018) (citation and quotation
marks omitted), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 139 S. Ct. 2760 , 204 L.Ed.2d 1148 (2019) .

As mentioned, the Photographs appeared within screenshots of the Post. The screenshots of the Post do not compete
with the Photographs in any market for photographs of women posing with motorcycles or any market for photographs of
women who have been involved in motorcycle accidents. It is highly unlikely that someone looking to license the
Photographs for their contents would seek a license from the Defendant over the Plaintiff. In addition, Plaintiff provided the
Photographs to Ms. Mitchell for her to share with her followers on Instagram, a platform premised on freely sharing images
with as many people as possible. The Plaintiff's willingness to share the Photographs with a potentially massive group of
people cuts against any suggestion that she had plans to commercialize the Photographs.

Plaintiff argues, citing Otto v. Hearst Commc'ns , Inc ., 345 F. Supp. 3d 412, 432 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), that she had the
right to sell the Photographs to media outlets writing about the story and the use by the Defendant destroyed any licensing
market she might have otherwise entered. In Otto , the plaintiff took a photograph of then-President Donald Trump attending
a wedding at the Mar-a-Lago hotel. After certain media outlets republished the photograph, the plaintiff belatedly decided he
wished to commercialize the photo himself. The court rightfully recognized that the plaintiff's failure to immediately capitalize
on the photograph should not preclude him from future profits.

[638 F.Supp.3d 356]

There are critical differences between the market effect in Otto and the market effect here. First, there is no indication
within Plaintiff's Complaint that at any point she intended to license the Photographs. Plaintiff notes that there was a clear
commercial licensing market because multiple media outlets would go on to publish the Photographs and accompanying
stories on the controversy. However, at no point does the Plaintiff indicate that she actually attempted to enter the market or
ever had any intention of entering the market. The court in Otto rightfully recognized that a copyright holder should not be
denied compensation just because he failed to quickly monetize his work. Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 432. But it did not
suggest that a plaintiff can shake down a news organization for a licensing payment for a copyrighted work that she never
intended to license.


--- Page 8 ---
Even drawing all inferences in Plaintiff's favor, it begs credulity that the Plaintiff would have ever wanted to license her
photographs for use in articles raising public awareness of a controversy surrounding her friend and subjecting the Plaintiff
herself to significant online criticism. Where a ""[p]laintiff had no intention of entering the market,"" the fourth factor weighs in
favor of the defendant. Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 432 (citing Swatch Grp . Mgmt . Servs . Ltd. v . Bloomberg L . P ., 756 F.3d
73 , 91 (2d Cir. 2014)).

Moreover, the Second Circuit had made clear that the possibility of lost licensing revenue is not sufficient to claim an
impact on the marketability of a copyright, Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 432 (citing Ringgold v . Black Entm't Television , Inc .,
126 F.3d 70 , 81 (2d Cir. 1997)), ""[o]nly an impact on potential licensing revenues for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be
developed markets should be legally cognizable."" /d. (Am. Geophysical Union v . Texaco Inc ., 60 F.3d 913 , 930 (2d Cir.
1994))

At the moment the plaintiff in Otto took the photograph, it was clear that the photograph would have a market for its
contents. News organizations reporting on the President's attendance of the wedding would want to license a photograph of
the President in attendance. Here, Plaintiff cannot reasonably claim that this secondary use market, a media firestorm about
her friend's controversial social media post, was ""traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed.""

As the Defendant's use plainly had and has no effect on any market for the Plaintiff's photographs of Ms. Mitchell, this
factor supports fair use.

Having considered all four fair use factors, three of which counsel for fair use and one of which counsels against, but is
afforded significantly less weight, the Court finds that the Defendant's use of the Photographs constitutes fair use. This case
must be dismissed.

As a result, this Court need not reach the issue of whether Plaintiff's copyright was validly registered.
CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant's s motion to dismissed is GRANTED.

Monsters have a long history and high standing in the realm of cultural niches. From Goliath in the Bible, to Charybdis
and Scylla in Homer, to Count Dracula, the genre of monsters has many admirers. Considering modern media, monsters
and movies are a likely pairing. Celluloid dexterity can illustrate—better than any selection of words—heightened emotions,
sudden movements, special effects, and whatever ""scariness"" a fan of monsters desires. The Irish playwright and poet
Oscar Wilde wrote:

Pathology is rapidly becoming the basis of sensational literature, and in art, as in politics, there is a great future
for monsters. 1

Many years ago, Plaintiff James Warren published several magazines that catered to the movie monster audience,
which was primarily composed of young males. On the cover of each of his magazines, he featured movie monster artwork
rom many artists, including Basil Gogos. More recently, Defendant J. David Spurlock produced a book that is a career
retrospective and biography of Basil Gogos. Twenty-four copies of Gogos artwork, which were previously used by Warren
or the magazine covers, are used in the book as illustrations and form the basis of Plaintiffs' primary claim of copyright
infringement.

Although the evidence is not clear that Plaintiffs have ownership rights to all of the artwork that is the subject matter of
his suit, the Defendant is willing to assume Plaintiffs’ ownership rights for purposes of the pending motions for summary
judgment. But even assuming ownership, the affirmative defense of fair use requires the Court to grant summary judgment
in favor of Spurlock on the copyright claim. And, because this Court concludes that the evidence, viewed in the light most
avorable to Plaintiffs, shows that Plaintiffs have abandoned the Famous Monsters of Filmland mark, the Court will also
grant summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ common law unfair competition claim.

|. Background and Procedural History

A. History of Warren Publishing and Magazine Publications

Plaintiffs in this case are James Warren (""Warren"") and the Warren Publishing Company (""Warren II""), of which James
Warren is the president and sole shareholder. A different company with the same name (""Warren I"") was dissolved in 1974.
James Warren was also the sole shareholder of Warren I, which printed and distributed several magazines and comic books
in the horror and monster film genre. Warren | first published a magazine entitled Famous Monsters of Filmland ("" Famous
Monsters "") in 1958. Each issue was at least 68 pages long, catered to fans of the movie monster genre, and regularly
featured articles, photographs, reviews, fan letters, and artwork that all focused on this increasingly popular topic. Two other
publications that are at issue here, entitled Creepy and Eerie, were also published by Warren I, and were of a similar nature.
Warren asserts that as soon as the magazines went to print, Warren | applied for and received a registered copyright for
each issue. Warren provides copyright registration numbers for each issue in contention in this suit, asserting that each
registration number establishes his current ownership.

Page 406
B. Magazine Cover Art and Basil Gogos

Warren commissioned many freelance artists to create images of movie monsters to display on the magazine covers.
Basil Gogos (""Gogos"") is one artist who designed cover art for Warren I. His work appeared on the covers of 51 of the 191
issues of Famous Monsters (more than any other artist), as well as the covers of at least two of Warren I's other serial
publications, Creepy and Eerie. Gogos was a freelance artist at the time Warren commissioned his works, and there is some
dispute between the parties as to who retained ownership of the underlying artwork. Warren argues that Gogos, like other
freelance artists hired to design covers, sold all rights to his artwork to Warren I. Spurlock, on the other hand, contends that
Gogos retained ownership over his art and only sold to Warren | a license for a one-time use of the art. The issue will be
more thoroughly discussed below. In any event, Warren | filed for bankruptcy and dissolved in 1974.

C. Basil Gogos Art Book

Defendant, J. David Spurlock (""Spurlock""), is the sole proprietor of the publishing company Vanguard Productions.
Spurlock claims that in 2004, he approached Warren about the idea of collaborating on a career retrospective of Basil
Gogos. Gogos spent a significant part of his career designing covers for Warren |, and Spurlock believed that a career
retrospective about Gogos and his art would be inadequate without acknowledgment of the period when Gogos designed
covers for Warren I. While there is some dispute over the substance of these negotiations, Warren and Spurlock never
came to an agreement on the project.


--- Page 3 ---
Spurlock, however, continued to pursue the idea, and in May 2005, he finalized a deal with Gogos to compile and
publish the book. In March 2006, Spurlock began selling the book, entitled Famous Monster Movie Art of Basil Gogos
(""Gogos Book""). Spurlock contends that the book is a work of scholarship that ""carefully and respectfully illustrate[s] the vast
output and evolution of the artist.""

Spurlock included reproductions of Gogos's art in the book that can be grouped into two types: (a) fourteen images
used in the Gogos Book are reproductions of original art by Gogos that were used by Warren as background illustrations for
the covers of Plaintiffs’ publications, but these images were not reproductions of the magazine covers that used the art; (b)
ten images used are exact reproductions 2 of covers from issues of Plaintiffs' magazines that utilized Gogos art, including
the text that was displayed on top of the artwork; and (c) images with no relation to Plaintiffs' magazines. Categories (a) and
(b) will be more thoroughly discussed in the following section. In total, the book contains over 160 reprints of Basil Gogos's
artwork, twenty four of which were from Famous Monsters, Creepy, or Eerie. The book is in its third printing and has sold
11,000 copies. Spurlock has personally profited from the book's publication, which at one point was priced at $250.

D. Description and Ownership of the Illustrations Reproduced in the Gogos Book

Plaintiffs’ Famous Monsters magazine was published over a number of years, from 1958 to 1983, for a total of 191
issues. Spurlock's book, entitled ""Famous Monster

Page 407
Movie Art of Basil Gogos,"" was first offered for sale in March 2006.

Plaintiffs claim twenty-four separate instances of copyright infringement. Of the ten images that are exact reproductions
of the entire magazine covers (listed on the chart below), which include the text of the cover, it appears that only seven $ of
the illustrations are reproductions of the actual covers of Plaintiffs' Famous Monsters magazine. + There is one image that
reproduces the cover of a copyrighted Creepy magazine published by Plaintiffs, and two images that are reproductions of
two copyrighted Eerie magazine covers. 5 The remaining fourteen claims of infringement by Plaintiffs concern Gogos artwork
that contain no printing or other detail, on their face, that would identify them as covers of Plaintiffs' magazines; these
illustrations in the book consist of only the artwork that Gogos provided for the magazine cover, absent the text later inserted
on the cover of the magazine. Although this artwork was depicted on the cover of Plaintiffs' magazine, the fact that
Spurlock's book only uses the original artwork, rather than the copyrighted magazine covers, prevents an automatic
conclusion that Spurlock infringed Plaintiffs’ copyrights. ® The issue of whether Plaintiffs also own the rights to the underlying
artwork is, in the final analysis, moot because Spurlock concedes Plaintiffs' ownership for purposes of the pending motions
and because summary judgment will be granted on the fair use defense. Nonetheless, these facts are relevant to the
Court's analysis and will be discussed.

The deposition testimony shows that Spurlock did admit to copying the ten works used as covers—seven works
directly from the Famous Monsters magazine covers, two works from the Eerie magazine covers, and one work from a
Creepy magazine cover—by using modern computer technology to digitally scan them. ” However, the facts of record as to
the method by which the other fourteen illustrations were secured are not clear. Plaintiffs, though having moved for partial
summary judgment on the issue of infringement, have not met their burden of showing no genuine issues of fact as to this
second set of illustrations. There is some testimony that Spurlock obtained the art from an individual who ""pilfered"" it from
Plaintiffs' trash dumpster, which may indicate

Page 408

that Warren intended to abandon the artwork, and other testimony that Spurlock copied the art directly from the current
owner of the original painting. § Even assuming the artwork was derived from a copy of Plaintiffs’ magazines, the fact that
Spurlock placed the illustration in the Gogos Book in the form of the original artwork, as opposed to an exact copy of the
covers, prevents this Court from finding infringement as a matter of law. A more extensive legal discussion concerning the
ownership of Gogos's artwork will be presented below.

As with using words to describe any work of illustrative art, the task of describing the Gogos artwork at issue in this
case is difficult. These colorful illustrations call for the use of colorful adjectives. The artwork of Basil Gogos, particularly to
the extent that it portrays monsters and the genre of monsters, could be characterized as lurid, expressive, scary, haunting,
disfigured—and a dictionary of synonyms could be consulted to round out this list. In addition, the colors are very
expressive, consisting of dramatic use of greens, yellows, reds—all colors that do not appear in the face of a normal human
being, but, according to monster legend, are commonly found in the faces of monsters.

The chart below will allow a cross reference to the seven reproduced covers from the Famous Monsters magazine, the
one cover from the Creepy magazine, and the two covers from the Eerie magazine. 9

E. Plaintiffs' Legal Claims

Plaintiffs bring two causes of action in their Second Amended Complaint. The first count consists of twenty-four claims
of copyright infringement-one claim for each image that Spurlock used from Warren's magazines. In addition, Plaintiffs bring
a Pennsylvania common law claim of unfair competition. Plaintiffs contend that the title of the book, Famous Monster Movie
Art of Basil Gogos, along with the copied images of the artist's work, is a misappropriation of the goodwill and valuable
recognition developed by Plaintiffs’ Famous Monsters magazine. Plaintiffs allege that this title is similar enough to Famous
Monsters of Filmland to improperly suggest to consumers that the Gogos Book is in someway related to, or endorsed by,
Plaintiffs’ popular magazine.

Plaintiffs seek a declaration of copyright infringement and unfair competition, a permanent injunction preventing future
infringement of Plaintiffs' copyrights and future unfair competition, an order requiring the recall of Spurlock's allegedly
infringing material, an order requiring the destruction of the allegedly infringing material with a subsequent report, statutory
damages, Plaintiffs' costs including attorneys' fees, pre—and post-judgment interest, and punitive damages.

F. Procedural History

Warren Company II and James Warren filed the initial complaint against Vanguard Productions, Inc. on July 21, 2008
alleging thirty-six claims of copyright infringement pursuant to the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. (Doc. 1).
Plaintiffs later filed an Amended Complaint, which is the operative complaint for purposes of the pending motions, against J.
David Spurlock d/b/a Vanguard Productions on January 14, 2009, instead alleging twenty-four claims of copyright
infringement, as well as the Pennsylvania state law claim of unfair competition. (Doc. 29).

Page 410

After extensive discovery, including several discovery disputes that the parties eventually resolved with the Court's
assistance, the parties filed several motions, which are currently before the Court. First, Spurlock filed a Motion to Preclude
Plaintiffs’ use and/or Reliance Upon the Expert Report and Testimony of Plaintiffs' ""Rebuttal"" Expert Witness—Denis Kitchen
on May 12, 2009. (Doc. 48). Two days later, on May 14, 2009, Spurlock also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on all of


--- Page 5 ---
Plaintiffs' claims. (Doc. 51). Plaintiffs then filed their own Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and for Sanctions (Doc. 49)
and a Motion to Preclude Defendant's Use and/or Reliance Upon the Expert Report and Testimony of Jeffrey Rovin (Doc.
50) on May 14, 2009. After Plaintiffs responded to Spurlock's Motion to Preclude on June 2, 2009 (Doc. 56), responses to
the other motions were all filed on June 11, 2009 (Doc. 58, 59, 60, 61, 62).

On June 25, 2009, this Court held oral argument on all of the outstanding motions. (Doc. 72-74). After a productive
discussion on the issues with the parties, both sides filed supplemental briefs on July 10, 2009. (Doc. 76, 77).

The summary judgment motions are now ripe for this Court's review. Because summary judgment will be entered in
favor of Spurlock on both counts, the motions relating to the experts will be denied as moot.

Il. Jurisdiction and Legal Standard
A. Jurisdiction

This Court has jurisdiction over the copyright infringement claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a)
(""The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to...
copyrights. . . .""). This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.

B. Legal Standard

Summary judgment is appropriate ""if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits
show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.""
Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). An issue is ""genuine"" if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the
nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby. Inc., 477 U.S. 242 , 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) . A factual
dispute is ""material"" if it might affect the outcome of the case under governing law. /d.

A party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility for informing the district court of the basis for
its motion and identifying those portions of the record that it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material
fact.Celotex Corp. v. Catrett. 477 U.S. 317 , 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . Where the non-moving party
bears the burden of proof on a particular issue at trial, the moving party's initial burden can be met simply by ""pointing out to
the district court that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case."" /d. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548 .
After the moving party has met its initial burden, the adverse party's response must, ""by affidavits or as otherwise provided
in this rule [ ] set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial."" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Summary judgment is appropriate if
the non-moving party fails to rebut by making a factual showing ""sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential
to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial."" Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 .
Under Rule 56, the Court must

Page 411

view the evidence presented on the motion in the light most favorable to the opposing party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255 ,
106 S.Ct. 2505 .

Ill. Copyright Infringement Claims

The first count of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint consists of the 24 claims of copyright infringement. ""To establish a
claim of copyright infringement, a plaintiff must establish: (1) ownership of a valid copyright; and (2) unauthorized copying of
original elements of the plaintiffs work."" Kay Berry, Inc. v. Taylor Gifts, Inc., 421 F.3d 199 , 203 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting Dun &
Bradstreet Software Servs., Inc. v. Grace Consulting. Inc., 307 F.3d 197 , 206 (3d Cir.2002)).

A. Ownership

1. Ownership of the Gogos Artwork

The primary defense in this case offered by Spurlock is, assuming that Plaintiffs have established a prima facie case
that the Gogos Book infringes Plaintiffs' magazine copyrights, the illustrations in the Gogos Book are entitled to the defense
of fair use. However, as Spurlock notes in his response to Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Plaintiffs raised a
novel claim of ownership to the underlying Gogos artwork in their Motion, that was not initially the basis of their copyright
claims in the Amended Complaint. Presumably, this assertion is due to the fact that, as discussed above, many of the
images used for the Gogos book were not actually copies of the covers of the copyrighted works, but were instead copies of
the Gogos artwork that was used for the covers. Though Plaintiffs make this assertion in their Motion for Partial Summary
Judgment, the material facts at issue are vigorously disputed. 1°

To what extent Plaintiffs can claim ownership over the artwork produced by Gogos for the covers implicates the ""work-
made-for-hire"" doctrine. Both the test to determine what works are included and the legal ramifications of work-for-hire
status depend on whether the work was prepared prior to the effective date of the 1976 Copyright Act—January 1, 1978.
See 1M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 5.03[B][2][c], at 5-56.1 (2009) (hereinafter Nimmer on Copyright ).
The parties agree that each of the works at issue was created prior to that date, and the 1909 Copyright Act therefore



--- Page 6 ---
controls. See Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Entm't Distrib., 429 F.3d 869 , 876 (9th Cir.2005).

First, the parties initially dispute whether the artwork is entitled to work-for-hire status. The Second Circuit has held that
artwork is a work for hire ""[w]hen one person engages another, whether as employee or as an independent contractor, to
produce a work of an artistic nature,"" which thereby creates a presumption ""that the mutual intent of the parties is that the

title to the copyright shall be in the person at whose instance and expense the work is done."" Playboy Enters., Inc. v.
Dumas,

Page 412

53 F.3d 549 , 554 (2d Cir.1995) (quoting Lin-Brook Builders Hardware v. Gertler, 352 F.2d 298 , 300 (9th Cir.1965)).
Whether a work was created at the ""instance and expense"" of an employer has apparently become the primary test of work-
for-hire status. /d. The test is also satisfied, and work-for-hire status established, ""when the ‘motivating factor in producing
the work was the employer who induced the creation."" /d. (quoting Siegel v. Nat'l Periodical Publ'ns, Inc., 508 F.2d 909 , 914
(2d Cir.1974)). An important factor in this inquiry is whether the employer has the right to ""direct and supervise the manner
in which the writer performs his work."" /d. (quoting Picture Music, Inc. v. Bourne, Inc., 457 F.2d 1213 , 1216 (2d Cir.1972)).

The parties dispute whether Gogos created the artwork at the ""instance and expense"" of Warren/Warren I. Ina
declaration provided to the Court, James Warren recalls how the commission was initiated and indicates that he exhibited
almost total control over the details of Gogos's work. (Warren Decl. 4 5). '' Spurlock in response argues that these
statements are legal conclusions, and offers the sworn factual testimony of Jeffrey Rovin (though he is also offered as an
expert), who was involved in much of the activities at issue as an employee of Warren I. Rovin stated that for some of the
covers, Gogos chose his own picture to use for the artwork, and even where Warren chose it, Warren had virtually no input
into the details of Gogos's painting. (Rovin Rep. 9 41-45). 12

Beyond the significant factual disputes that exist as to whether the Gogos artwork is entitled to work-for-hire status,
there are also significant disputes of fact concerning what legal rights each party is entitled to if the artwork was a work-for-
hire. The parties agree that the 1909 Act applies, and it provides that, for purposes of copyright, ""the word ‘author' shall
include an employer in the case of works made for hire."" Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 , 743-44,
109 S.Ct. 2166 , 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989) (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 26 (1976 ed.)). However, the statute does not define the term
""employer"" and does not explicitly provide an assignment of rights for commissioned works. /d. at 744, 109 S.Ct. 2166 . In
addressing the issue without the benefit of

Page 413

any statutory guidance, courts generally presumed that, for purposes of commissioned works, ""the commissioned party had
impliedly agreed to convey the copyright, along with the work itself, to the hiring party."" /d. Beyond this initial presumption, ""
[w]hether copyright initially vested in the independent contractor preparing the work on commission or in the commissioning
party always turned on the intention of the parties, where that intention could be ascertained."" 1 Nimmer on Copyright, §
5.03[B][2][c], at 5-56.1 (citing, inter alia, Brattleboro Publ'g Co. v. Winmill Publ'g Corp., 369 F.2d 565 (2d Cir.1966) ).
However, ""[t]he burden of proof is on the independent contractor to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that
such a contrary agreement was reached."" Playboy Enters., 53 F.3d at 554-55 .

With no detailed agreement establishing the intent of the parties, each side again presents their own version of events.
Warren provides in his declaration that he and Gogos had an agreement that Warren would gain all rights to the work, and
at some point the check that Warren wrote to Gogos for payment contained a mark that indicated such an intent. (Warren
Decl. 4 5). 1? On the other hand, Spurlock offers several pieces of evidence in response to suggest that the parties never did
intend such a transfer of rights. First, Spurlock offers the declaration of Basil Gogos himself, who states that he and Warren
""had an express gentleman's agreement that any art | created would be used once only on the cover of one of his
magazines and all of [his] art would be returned."" (Def. Opp. to Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. Ex. A). '4

Next, Spurlock offers several pieces of evidence regarding the standard practice for ownership of rights to artwork
commissioned by Warren. See 1 Nimmer on Copyright, § 5.03[D], at 5-56.12 (""[A] custom or usage whereby certain rights
are reserved to the employee, if such custom or usage was known to the parties, or might be presumed to have been so
known, would become an implied in fact term of the contract of employment""). First, Rovin states that, ""[i]f there were [sic] a
general policy regarding cover art, it was this: artists tended to allow Warren [ ] to print, and reprint, the artwork as a cover
without obtaining permission or making additional payment(s); but artists were free to sell the original art or use it in career
compendia or genre overviews."" (Rovin Rep. § 27). '° Spurlock then offers the testimony of several other cover artists, who
testified that they retained the rights to their artwork and only sold Warren a one-time license for the magazine covers, 1®
thus suggesting that this was the

Page 414
standard practice of Warren/Warren | at the time.
These disagreements preclude coming to a conclusion on the issue of ownership in the artwork, and show that there is

a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiffs have ownership rights to the artwork that Spurlock used in the book,
which are the basis of the majority of Plaintiffs' claims. This in itself would be sufficient to defeat Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial


--- Page 7 ---
Summary Judgment on these pieces of art. However, as will be discussed below, this issue is mooted by Spurlock's reliance
on the fair use defense; though, to the extent that it is relevant to the fair use analysis, the unsettled ownership of the
artwork may bear on Plaintiffs’ claim that Spurlock engaged in ""bad faith"" by utilizing the art in the Gogos Book without
paying a licensing fee.

2. Ownership of the Magazine Copyrights

In addition, Spurlock claims that when Warren | filed for bankruptcy, all assets of Warren I, including the copyrights and
trademarks at issue in this case, were sold to Harris Publications, Inc. (""Harris""). Warren, however, claims that after all the
company's debts were satisfied, this intellectual property was transferred to him, as the sole shareholder of Warren I. In
1984, Harris disputed Warren's ownership and laid claim to the literary properties of Warren |. In 2000, a settlement was
reached with Harris whereby Warren and Warren II, which was incorporated by Warren in 1998, took undisputed ownership
to all of the relevant literary properties. Plaintiffs assert that since that time, Warren and Warren II have been the undisputed
owners of the Famous Monsters copyrights involved in this suit. Spurlock nonetheless contends that the copyrights were
issued to Warren | and that Plaintiffs therefore do not have standing to bring this suit.

3. Ownership of Eerie and Creepy Copyrights

Additionally, there is a dispute between the parties over who owns the copyrights to the Creepy and Eerie comics. In
February 2007, Warren II transferred all rights to Creepy and Eerie over to a third party, New Comic Company LLC. Spurlock
contends that the Purchase Agreement transferred the right to sue for any infringement of these copyrights. Plaintiffs,
however, argue that the right to sue for infringement that occurred prior to the date of the contract remained with Plaintiffs.

In any event, despite these disputes over ownership, Spurlock's counsel conceded at oral argument that, for purposes
of the motions for summary judgment, Plaintiffs have satisfied the elements of ownership and copying. See (Oral Arg. 4:14-
5:24) (Def. Counsel: ""My summary judgment would presume that he owns them, Your Honor.... Judge: ""And the same thing
for copying? You concede that as well?"" Def. Counsel: ""For purposes—yes, absolutely."""").

Spurlock's Motion for Summary Judgment instead focuses solely on the affirmative defense of fair use. See (Oral Arg.
5:6-9) (Def. Counsel: ""My summary judgment would presume that he owns them, Your Honor. My summary judgment is ...
based upon fair use.""). Nonetheless, these disputes over ownership may have some bearing on whether Spurlock is entitled
to the protection of fair use.

B. Fair Use Defense

The defense of fair use for copyright claims has a long and deep history. ""From the infancy of copyright protection,
some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials has been thought necessary to fulfill copyright's very purpose, “[t]o
promote the Progress of Science and useful

Page 415

Arts ...."""" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.,510 U.S. 569 , 575,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (quoting U.S.
Const, art. |, § 8). While the defense was not initially codified in 1790, when Congress first established the copyright

infringement cause of action, ""the doctrine was recognized by the American courts nonetheless."" /d. at 576, 114 S.Ct. 1164 .
The affirmative defense of fair use was finally codified by the 1976 Copyright Act. /d.

The textual basis of the defense now provides that:

the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other
means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including
multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining
whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon
consideration of all the above factors.

17 U.S.C. § 107. Courts do not consider fair use ""with bright-line rules, for the statute, like the doctrine it recognizes,
calls for case-by-case analysis."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The four listed factors are not to be
considered in isolation and ""do not represent a score card that promises victory to the winner of the majority."" Video
Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista Home Entm't, Inc., 342 F.3d 191 , 198 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair



--- Page 8 ---
Use Standard, 103 Harv. L.Rev. 1105, 1110 (1990)). Instead, the factors are ""to be explored, and the results weighed
together, in light of the purposes of copyright."" /d. (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ); see also Leval,
supra, at 1110-11 (""[The fair use factors] direct courts to examine the issue from every pertinent corner and to ask in each
case whether, and how powerfully, a finding of fair use would serve or disserve the objectives of the copyright.""). ""This focus
on copyright's purpose makes relevant a comparison of the copy with the original: where the copier uses none of his own
creative activity to transform the original work, holding the fair use doctrine inapplicable will not likely interfere with
copyright's goal of encouraging creativity."" Video Pipeline, 342 F.3d at 198 . ""[T]he alleged infringer bears the burden of
proof"" on the issue since fair use is an affirmative defense. /d. at 197.

1. Fair Use on Summary Judgment

The threshold issue at this stage of proceedings, in considering Spurlock's reliance on fair use, is to what extent district
courts may consider such a defense on summary judgment. While the Third Circuit has not yet specifically addressed this
issue, the Second and the Ninth Circuits have. Both Circuits have generally recognized that, ""[a]lthough the issue of fair use
is a mixed question of law and fact, the court may resolve issues of fair use at the summary judgment stage where there are
no genuine issues of material fact as to such issues."" Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448

Page 416
F.3d 605, 608 (2d Cir.2006); Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811 , 817 (9th Cir. 2003) (""We also review the court's

finding of fair use, which is a mixed question of law and fact, [ de novo ].""); see also Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enters. 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (""Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact.""). 17

2. Factor 1—Purpose and Character

The first factor requires the Court to consider ""the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). The first factor is intended to determine

whether the new work ""merely supersede[s] the objects"" of the original creation, or instead adds something new,
with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message; it asks,
in other words, whether and to what extent the new work is ""transformative."" Although such transformative use is
not absolutely necessary for a finding of fair use, the goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is
generally furthered by the creation of transformative works.... [T]he more transformative the new work, the less
will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.

Campbell,_510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal citations omitted).

Two other considerations in the context of the first fair use factor bear mentioning. First, much has been made about
what impact an infringing work's ""commercial"" purpose, as opposed to ""nonprofit"" purpose, has on this first factor. While
some language in an earlier decision of the Supreme Court had suggested that an infringing work's commercial purpose was
dispositive of the first factor, see Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios. Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 451,104 S.Ct. 774 , 78
L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (""[E]very commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively ... unfair ....""), more recent decisions
have provided some clarification.

[T]he commercial or nonprofit educational purpose of a work is only one element of the first factor enquiry ....
[T]he mere fact that a use is educational and not for profit does not insulate it from a finding of infringement, any
more than the commercial character of a use bars a finding of fairness.

Campbell,_510 U.S. at 584 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Instead, ""the ‘fact that a publication was commercial as opposed to
nonprofit is a separate factor that tends to weigh against a finding of fair use."" /d. at 585, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting Harper &
Row, 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ); Video Pipeline, 342 F.3d at 198 (""If a new work is

Page 417

used commercially rather than for a nonprofit purpose, its use will less likely qualify as fair.""). ""The crux of the profit/nonprofit
distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation
of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price."" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 .

Second, much has also been made of a defendant's ""bad faith"" in regards to the first factor. While the Supreme Court
in Harper & Rowstated that good faith and fair dealing were required for a finding of fair use, 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct.
2218 , the Court's later decision inCampbell appeared to suggest, though not directly holding, that this was no longer true,
510 U.S. at 585 n. 18, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; see also Leval, supra, at 1126 (""No justification exists for adding a morality test.""). In
any event, the important lesson on bad faith to be taken from Campbell is that a defendant's ""request for permission to use
the original"" and ""being denied permission to use a work do[ ] not weigh against a finding of fair use."" Campbell,_510 U.S. at
585 n. 18, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Where the defendant requested permission, ""the offer may simply have been made in a good-
faith effort to avoid [] litigation."" /d.



--- Page 9 ---
a. Transformative Nature

One of the leading and most incisive explanations of the concept of transformative use comes from Judge Leval's
seminal law review article:

The use must be productive and must employ the quoted matter in a different manner or for a different purpose
from the original. A quotation of copyrighted material that merely repackages or republishes the original is
unlikely to pass the test; in Justice Story's words, it would merely ""supersede the objects"" of the original. If, on
the other hand, the secondary use adds value to the original—if the quoted matter is used as raw material,
transformed in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings—this is the
very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society.

Leval, supra, at 1111. He later elaborates:
Quoting is not necessarily stealing.

Quotation can be vital to the fulfillment of the public-enriching goals of copyright law. The first fair use factor calls
for a careful evaluation whether the particular quotation is of the transformative type that advances knowledge
and the progress of the arts or whether it merely repackages, free riding on another's creations. . . . Factor One
is the soul of fair use.

Id. at 1116. 18

Spurlock contends that his use of Plaintiffs’ work in a biography and artist's retrospective ""is a work of scholarship,
comment, and research, and is precisely the type of work that the Fair Use Doctrine is intended to protect."" He argues that,
while the original purpose of the covers was to sell magazines, his use of the covers is transformative since it is biographical
in nature and illustrates the ""evolution of an artist."" Spurlock further notes that, of the 24 covers at issue, 14 are displayed
without any Famous Monsters text obstructing the artwork, and any claims of infringement, even if legally valid, are
misguided because the copying is only of the Gogos artwork without any reference to Plaintiffs’ magazine.

Page 418

Plaintiffs respond by arguing that the Gogos Book attempts to present the art in a pure form. Although some of the
images appear without the Famous Monsters headings and some are reduced in size, many are reproduced in virtually the
same size as the original magazine covers (8.5"" x 11""), are the main ""focal points"" of each page, and are reproduced for the
appreciation of the artistic accomplishment—the same purpose for which the covers were originally used. Additionally,
Plaintiffs note that many of the reproductions are unaccompanied by any commentary or criticism and that ""[t]he degree of
copying and the manner in which the reproductions are prominently displayed, combined with the absence of commentary,
is [sic] inconsistent with alleged “scholarship.”

There are some characteristics regarding Spurlock's use that do not support his claim of fair use. For instance, the fact
that Plaintiffs' work is in a periodical magazine format, as compared to Spurlock's work composed of a single issue book, is
relevant but not determinative. See Blanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d 244 , 252 (2d Cir.2006) (""We have declined to find a
transformative use when the defendant has done no more than find a new way to exploit the creative virtues of the original
work.""). And, Plaintiffs are correct in noting that the covers and images are reproduced with little or no modification.

But the Gogos Book presents these images for an entirely different purpose. The book takes the reader through the
history of Gogos's work and his career. It discusses Gogos's time creating art for the covers of James Warren's magazines,
chronicles his work that portrayed the ""Old West,"" then moves on to his art in ""men's magazines."" The book also provides
commentary from many respected individuals in the movie monster industry who attest to the quality of the work and his
lasting legacy. The Gogos Book is a retrospective and an illustrated biography of an artist who was, and remains, important
to movie monster enthusiasts. While the subject matter of his artwork may be unconventional, Basil Gogos created
significant and highly detailed art, often used as illustrations for magazines, movie posters, and advertisements. The Gogos
Book utilizes the magazine covers as several examples of those many different productions in order to pay homage to his
artistic accomplishments. Spurlock's book is focused on the art of one person, Gogos.

The Warren magazines, on the other hand, do no such thing. Each of the magazine issues is devoted towards
discussing developments in the world of movie monsters, interviewing actors in the genre (e.g., Béla Lugosi), and
advertising various movie monster-related paraphernalia. With the nature of the magazines in mind, the covers were not
used for the purpose of paying homage to Basil Gogos or to chronicle his career. Rather, these covers were utilized to help
sell magazines, for the purpose of describing the latest in monster movies through an eye-catching display, and to convey to
the reader or potential reader what topics the magazine discussed in that issue.

As a representative example, for issue number 59 of the Famous Monsters magazine (the focus of Plaintiffs’ fifth claim
of copyright infringement) Basil Gogos created a piece depicting the portrait of a television character, Barnabas Collins, who
was a vampire in the television show ""Dark Shadows."" In front of the artwork, the cover exclaims that the issue contains an
article ""All About Barnabas Collins!"". (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 12). The article referred to, entitled ""Who's A-Frid of the Big
Bad Vampire,"" profiles Jonathan Frid, the actor who portrays Barnabas Collins, and discusses the television show.
Importantly, the magazine does not use the art-work


--- Page 10 ---
Page 419

in order to portray Gogos's talents or chronicle his career. Instead, the artwork is used to promote the magazine's article
discussing Barnabas Collins and the Dark Shadows show. The same can be said of each of the other magazine covers that
are at issue in this litigation.

As Judge Leval explains, the first factor requires this Court to consider whether the infringing work ""employ[s] the
quoted matter in a different manner or for a different purpose from the original."" Leval, supra, at 1111. This question is
clearly answered in the affirmative. After reviewing the Gogos Book and the Warren magazines in detail and in their entirety,
his Court finds that Spurlock's use of the Gogos art is transformative relative to the original purpose.

What is particularly pertinent to this Court's analysis and conclusion is that the Gogos Book is appropriately
characterized as a biography or a career retrospective. As the Second Circuit's caselaw indicates, ""biographies in general
and critical biographies in particular, fit ‘comfortably within' these statutory categories ‘of uses illustrative of uses that can be
air."" New Era Publ'ns Int'l. ApS v. Carol Publ'g Group, 904 F.2d 152 , 156 (2d Cir.1990) (quoting Salinger v. Random
House, Inc., 811 F.2d 90 , 96 (2d Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 890 , 108 S.Ct. 213 , 98 L.Ed.2d 177 ). While
acknowledging that these categories are not endowed with a presumptive entitlement to the defense, Harper & Row, 471
U.S. at 561 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (""This listing was not intended to be exhaustive or to single out any particular use as
presumptively a ‘fair’ use."") (internal citations omitted), this Court's analysis is ""guided by the examples"" of § 107's
preamble, Campbell,_510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 , and the examples help illustrate the purpose of fair use and the
lypes of works that meet its requirements. That Spurlock's book fits ""comfortably within"" the statutory categories only serves
0 reinforce this Court's conclusion that Spurlock's use was transformative.

b. Analogous Cases

In coming to its conclusion, this Court finds two cases particularly analogous. First, in Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling
Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 2006) , the Second Circuit determined that the defendant's coffee table book, which
provided a ""cultural history of the Grateful Dead,"" was sufficiently transformative, relative to the original purpose of the
copyrighted images from Grateful Dead event posters and tickets, for several reasons. /d. at 608-12. First, the court found
that the defendant's book was essentially a

biographical work documenting the 30-year history of the Grateful Dead. While there are no categories of
presumptively fair use, courts have frequently afforded fair use protection to the use of copyrighted material in
biographies, recognizing such works as forms of historic scholarship, criticism, and comment that require
incorporation of original source material for optimum treatment of their subjects.

Id. at 609 (internal citations omitted). While the copyrighted works were artistic and ""were apparently widely distributed
to generate public interest in the Grateful Dead and to convey information to a large number of people about the band's
forthcoming concerts,"" id., the defendant ""used each of [the] images as historical artifacts to document and represent the
actual occurrence of Grateful Dead concert events featured on [the book]'s timeline,"" id. The court also stated that the
defendant's claim that the use was transformative was ""strengthened by the manner in which [the defendant] displayed the
images."" /d. at 611. The copyrighted works were reduced to sizes that were only large enough ""to

Page 420

permit readers to recognize the historical significance of the posters"" and were combined ""with a prominent timeline, textual
material, and original graphical artwork, to create a collage of text and images on each page of the book."" /d.

Next, the court found that the copyrighted images were only ""an inconsequential portion of [the defendant's book],"" id.,
recognizing that ""[t]he extent to which unlicensed material is used in the challenged work can be a factor in determining
whether a biographer's use of original materials has been sufficiently transformative to constitute fair use,"" id. Because the
defendant's book only contained the plaintiffs images on seven, out of 480, pages, and since the images were less than
1/20th the size of the originals at the most, this too supported the defendant. Finally, the court considered whether the
""commercial purpose"" inquiry worked against a finding of fair use for the defendant. The court concluded that it did not and
stated that the defendant had ""not used any of [the plaintiff]'s images in its commercial advertising or in any other way to
promote the sale of the book."" /d. at 612. With all these considerations in mind, the court held that the first fair use factor
weighed in favor of the defendant.

In comparing Bill Graham to the facts at hand, the Second Circuit's analysis illustrates the differences between the
Gogos Book and Plaintiffs' magazine covers that establish the transformative nature of the use. First, the difference in
purpose, between how Plaintiffs used the magazine covers as compared to Spurlock, is almost identical to the difference
described in Bill Graham. Plaintiffs’ magazine covers had been used ""to generate public interest"" in the magazines and ""to
convey information"" to passers-by of the magazine's content in that issue. Spurlock, on the other hand, used the covers ""as
historical artifacts to document and represent"" the work product of an accomplished artist. Second, Spurlock's manner of
reproduction is also supportive of fair use. Many of the images were reduced in size, had the cover text and the magazine
title logo removed, and were the subject of criticism and commentary adjacent to the art. Where the cover text was not
removed, the images were reduced to only a fraction of their original size. As to Plaintiffs' argument that Spurlock could


--- Page 11 ---
have reduced the larger images or changed all of them to black-and-white, such modifications would undermine the very
heart of the publication, which is to chronicle the achievements of a renowned artist. Vivid colors are an important element in
depicting monsters, particularly their faces. The proportion of images in the Gogos Book that were allegedly improperly used
is also small (24 out of 160, or 15%).

Finally, there is little evidence to support Plaintiffs’ claims that Spurlock's use was sufficiently commercial in nature to
overcome the transformative purpose. Though Plaintiffs point out that Spurlock admits to making a profit from the book, ""
[t]he crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user
stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price."" Bill Graham, 448 F.3d at
612 (quoting Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ). The only arguments Plaintiffs make in support of this narrow
argument is that: (a) the front flap states that art from Plaintiffs' magazines will be included; (b) one copyrighted cover is
included on the back with four other magazine covers; and (c) the title is misleading (the same argument made for the unfair
competition claim). The fact that the front flap, which contains information on the contents of the book, accurately informs
readers that some of the Gogos images from Plaintiffs’ magazines are included, cannot seriously be characterized as
""exploitation.""

Page 421

The placement of a cover on the back of the book with four other images not from Plaintiffs’ magazines is relatively minor in
nature, even if supportive of Plaintiffs’ ""commercialism"" argument. And, to the extent that Plaintiffs rely on the argument that
the title is misleading, Plaintiffs have not offered any caselaw to suggest that this would satisfy the ""commercialism"" inquiry.
In any event, to the extent that any of these relatively minor uses could be characterized as ""exploitation"" of Plaintiffs’
copyrighted works, the transformative nature of Spurlock's use is more than sufficient to push the first factor in Spurlock's
favor.

The second analogous case is Hofheinz v. A & E Television Networks, 146 F.Supp.2d 442 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (Sweet, J.).
In Hofheinz, the claim for copyright infringement concerned an A & E biography of an actor, Peter Graves. /d. at 443. As with
most A & E biographies, the 60-minute television program contained clips from movies and television shows that Peter
Graves was involved in, and it also provided commentary from Graves, his family, and his friends. Id. The biography
contained a 20-second clip of one of Graves's movies, ""It Conquered the World,"" though the footage was actually derived
from the theatrical trailer. /d. at 443-44. On a motion for summary judgment, the court held that A & E's biography did
amount to ""fair use."" /d. at 449. As to the first fair use factor, the court stated that, while the A & E piece ""may not be a
‘scholarly’ biography ... the use made of this particular footage from “It Conquered the World,' to show the kind of motion
picture roles Graves took when he first began his acting career and what his perception of them was, served to enrich the
biography through the actor's perspective on his own work."" /d. at 446. The court determined that the use was
""transformative"" since it ""enabl[ed] the viewer to understand the actor's modest beginnings in the film business."" /d. at 446-
47.

The facts of the case at hand are very similar to those in Hofheinz. Though the Gogos Book is not ""scholarly,"" it is
certainly a biography, or at least a career retrospective. And for that reason, applying Judge Sweet's language to these
facts: Plaintiffs' use of the copyrighted magazines, ""to show the kind of [work Gogos] took when he first began his [ ] career
and what his perception of [the work] was, served to enrich the biography through the [artist]'s perspective on his own work.""
Id. at 446. Judge Sweet came to his conclusion that fair use existed in Hofheinz even where the A & E biography could be
characterized as ""commercial in nature"" in the same ways as the Gogos Book. Nonetheless, the fact that the copyrighted
clip was meant to put the artist's career in context and communicate to the audience the type of work that Peter Graves took
part in was sufficient to make the biography's use ""transformative."" All the facts deemed relevant to establish fair use in

Hofheinz could be said of the Gogos Book, which also provides a history of the artist and places his work into some context.
c. Bad Faith

The final issue for the first factor is whether Spurlock engaged in bad faith, which could have some impact on the first
factor analysis. '9 Plaintiffs argue that Spurlock did act in bad faith since he allegedly knew that Plaintiffs owned the
copyrights, negotiated for a licensing fee,

Page 422

but then went ahead with publication when the parties could not come to an agreement. Defendants also raise the earlier

argument that Spurlock engaged in bad faith by trying to make the book title similar to the Famous Monsters magazine.
(Spurlock Dep. 1/28/09 213:14-215:8).

As to Plaintiffs' first suggestion, that Spurlock's failed attempt at negotiating a licensing fee amounts to bad faith, such a
claim has been considered and explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court. In Campbell, the plaintiff also made the argument
that the defendant's ""request for permission to use the original should be weighed against a finding of fair use."" 510 U.S. at
585 n. 18, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . In dismissing the argument, the court stated that ""the offer may simply have been made in a
good-faith effort to avoid this litigation. ... Thus, being denied permission to use a work does not weigh against a finding of
fair use."" Id.

In addition, Plaintiffs’ first argument— essentially, that Spurlock knew Plaintiffs owned the copyrights but went ahead


--- Page 12 ---
anyway—is difficult to accept in light of the Court's earlier discussion concerning the ownership of the artwork. As noted
above, most of the images used by Spurlock that are at issue here were not copies of the magazine covers, but were copies
of the art used as the background of the magazine covers. For these images, it is by no means clear, even after discovery,
who owns the rights to these images. In light of this, it would be difficult to fault Spurlock and charge him with ""bad faith"" for
using the images. If this Court were to come to such a conclusion, claims of fair use would be undermined for an
overwhelming number of defendants in copyright cases—for defendants that were aware that the plaintiffs had ownership
over the works, and for defendants where ownership was dubious. Because this does not comport with the rationale behind
the bad faith inquiry, this Court will not accept Plaintiffs’ argument.

Finally, as to Plaintiffs’ claim that the misleading nature of the title is supportive of bad faith, Plaintiffs have again failed
to offer any caselaw that would support such a theory.

In any event, even if bad faith has some role in the first factor analysis, Spurlock has shown that his use of the
copyrighted works is sufficiently transformative relative to the original use by Plaintiffs. Therefore, in light of all of the
evidence on the record and all of the first factor considerations, this Court determines that the first fair use factor weighs
heavily in favor of Spurlock.

3. Factor 2—Nature of the Plaintiff's Work

The second factor requires this Court to consider ""the nature of the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(2). ""This factor
calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with the

consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 . Works that are fictional or creative are ""closer to this core"" than those works that are primarily factual Video

Pipeline,342 F.3d at 200 . In his brief, Spurlock concedes that the copyrighted magazine covers fall within the core of the
Copyright Act's protective purposes since they are creative expressions.

However, the fact that the copyrighted magazines are out-of-print has some bearing on the second fair use factor. In

Peter Letterese & Assocs., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enters., Int'l., 533 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir.2008) , the Eleventh
Circuit considered the impact that out-of-print status has on the second factor analysis:

Page 423

[O]ut-of-print works are generally accorded less copyright protection. The relevant fact is not simply that the work
is unavailable for purchase through normal channels.... Rather, that fair use is more likely to apply in the
standard scenario of an out-of-print work reflects in large part the assumption that no market harm to the owner
will come of the use, as presumably it was lack of demand for the work that led to its demise. . . . Neither the
personal nor the property interests of the author are thus strongly implicated with respect to the typical out-of-
print work.

Id. at 1313. However, the court noted that the copyrighted work at issue in that case was out-of-print due to the
author's choice to withdraw the work from the market, rather than from a lack of demand. /d. This difference somewhat
complicates the analysis, which then turns on motivations for removal from the market, pricing strategies, and whether a
market exists for the work. /d. at 1313-14.

In the case at hand, there is some dispute between the parties as to whether Famous Monsters and the other
magazines became out-of-print due to Warren's health or because of declining interest in the genre. However, this debate
ignores the proper focus—the cause for the out-of-print status as to each copyrighted work, not the cause for the end of
Plaintiffs' magazines. Each issue of the magazines became out-of-print simply because that is the natural and inevitable fate
for magazines and periodicals, such as the magazines formerly owned by Plaintiffs. For example, as to the focus of the first
claim of copyright infringement, Warren did not end publication of Famous Monsters # 23 due to Warren's health, but simply
because the company moved on to the next issue of Famous Monsters. A fair argument could be made that this cuts in
favor of Spurlock's argument that each issue went out-of-print due to lack of demand, even if that is the nature of the
market.

In any event, as Spurlock notes, courts have recognized that this second factor is of limited usefulness where the
defendant's work is ""transformative"" in nature. See Bill Graham, 448 F.3d at 612 (""We recognize, however, that the second
factor may be of limited usefulness where the creative work of art is being used for a transformative purpose."" (citing
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 )). That statement is true in this case. This Court finds that this factor weighs
slightly in favor of Plaintiffs, but it is of limited relevance because of the prior finding that Spurlock's work is transformative.

4. Factor 3—Amount and Substantiality Used

For the third factor, this Court must next consider ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). In other words, this factor inquires whether ""the quantity and value of the
materials used"" by the defendant ""are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 . ""[T]his factor calls for thought not only about the quantity of the materials used, but about their quality and
importance, too."" /d. at 587, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . In addition, consideration of the nature of the infringing work is relevant, since
""the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use."" /d. at 586-87, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . In


--- Page 13 ---
general, though, ""a work composed primarily of an original, particularly its heart, with little added or changed, is more likely
to be a merely superseding use, fulfilling demand for the original."" /d. at 587-88, 114 S.Ct. 1164 .

As to the quantitative analysis, Spurlock next argues that the magazine covers that
Page 424

he copied make up only 1-1.5% of each of Plaintiffs' copyrighted works, which is each issue of the magazines. In response,
Plaintiffs rely on Schiffer Publ'g, Ltd. v. Chronicle Books, LLC, 2004 WL 2583817 (E.D.Pa. Nov.12, 2004) (Schiller, J.). In
Schiffer, the court considered the legitimacy of the fair use defense for a defendant that copied individual photographs from
13 of the plaintiffs copyrighted books; the books were the copyrighted products, not the individual photographs within the
books. /d. at *1-4. In considering the third fair use factor, the court rejected the argument that Spurlock makes here, stating
that such an argument ""misapprehends the proper frame of reference. Each photograph is an individually copyrighted work,
and it is the amount used of each one that should be analyzed."" /d. at *12. Plaintiffs argue that the covers, like the
photographs in Schiffer, are individually copyrighted works, and the copying should be measured in terms of each magazine
cover.

Plaintiffs’ argument, however, is contrary to binding precedent. In conducting the quantitative portion of the third factor
analysis, both the Supreme Court and the Third Circuit have considered the portion of the copyrighted work utilized by the
infringing work relative to the copyrighted work as a whole. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586-90 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (comparing
copyrighted song in its entirety to the defendant's song); Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564-65 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (conducting
quantitative analysis of third factor by considering what portion of the entire copyrighted manuscript the defendant's
infringing work used); Video Pipeline, 342 F.3d at 201 (conducting quantitative analysis of the third factor by considering
what portion of the entire copyrighted movie the defendant's infringing previews used). None of the Supreme Court or Third
Circuit cases support Plaintiffs' argument that the copyrighted work can be cut or spliced to maximize the percentage used
and to support Plaintiffs' response to the fair use defense. Indeed, the factor itself dictates otherwise. See 17 U.S.C. §
107(3) (""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole. "" (emphasis
added)).

Spurlock is therefore correct when he asserts that, since each of the magazines ranged from 68 to 100 pages, (Def.'s
Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 8-27, 38, 28, 39-40), the portion taken was from 1% to 1.5% of each of the magazines. This Court finds,
as the Third Circuit did in Video Pipeline, that such a portion taken ""is quite small."" 342 F.3d at 201 (finding that 1.7% to
2.2% copying to be quantitatively small). Indeed, Plaintiffs could not reasonably be expected to take anything less; the entire
point of using these covers is to portray Gogos's work. Therefore, this percentage is also quantitatively ""reasonable in
relation to the purpose of the copying."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 .

Nonetheless, Plaintiffs argue, and Spurlock disputes, that the magazine covers were qualitatively a significant portion
of the magazines and were at ""the heart"" of the magazine's content. Plaintiffs contend that the covers were a ""central and
valuable part of Plaintiffs' works."" (Warren Decl. § 9); (Gogos Book, Front Flap) (""Issues of [| Famous Monsters ] practically
leapt off the newsstand due in no small way to their striking cover paintings by Basil Gogos.""). Spurlock, on the other hand,
argues that the ""heart"" of the magazines was not the covers, but was instead the content of the magazines that kept its
readers up-to-date on movie monster gossip.

Upon a review of the magazines and the other evidence in the record, this Court finds that Spurlock did not appropriate
the ""heart"" of the copyrighted works. As discussed above in the first fair use factor analysis, each magazine was devoted to

Page 425

updating its readers on recent developments in the movie monster industry and providing in-depth interviews with leading
figures in the world of movie monsters. The magazines did not include a collage of movie monster art or a portfolio of movie
monster artists. Indeed, no issue highlights the work of a specific artist. The covers were not the qualitative ""heart"" of the
magazines, but were instead used to catch the eye of potential readers at the newsstand and advertise the content of the
magazine. The quality and importance of these covers as used in the original magazines are relatively minor.

Plaintiffs also argue that Spurlock has not offered any good reason why he could not have changed the covers to be
different, e.g., black-and-white or smaller size. However, making these changes would directly thwart one of the key
purposes of the book—to showcase the detailed work of Basil Gogos. Though such a burdensome change may be
necessary in other cases where the defendant takes both a quantitatively large portion and the ""heart"" of the copyrighted
work, Spurlock did neither.

In light of the above analysis, this Court finds that the third fair use factor weighs in favor of Spurlock.

5. Factor 4—Effect on Potential Market Value

Finally, the fourth factor requires this Court to consider ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). This factor includes

not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether


--- Page 14 ---
unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant ... would result in a substantially
adverse impact on the potential market for the original. The enquiry must take account not only of harm to the
original but also of harm to the market for derivative works.

Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal citations and quotations omitted). The market for derivative works
""includes only those that creators of original works would in general develop or license others to develop."" /d. at 592, 114
S.Ct. 1164 . The extent to which the market is harmed is a ""matter of degree, and the importance of this factor will vary, not
only with the amount of harm, but also with the relative strength of the showing on the other factors."" /d. at 591 n. 21, 114

S.Ct. 1164 . As with the three other factors, the defendant has the burden to offer favorable evidence on market effectid. at
590, 114 S.Ct. 1164 .

Plaintiffs’ arguments on this factor focus solely on the market for derivative works of the magazines and, in particular, a
coffee-table book that Warren has considered publishing. Warren asserts that he has, and has had for some time, an
interest in using the Famous Monsters magazines and the magazine covers for a coffee-table book that would chronicle the
history and success of the Famous Monsters of Filmland magazines. Spurlock, on the other hand, argues that Warren's
interest has been just that—only interest—and that, despite his self-professed intent to create this book, Warren has taken
no significant steps to do so.

Upon a review of the evidence on the record, this Court agrees with Spurlock that Warren has exhibited little genuine
interest in actually publishing this coffee table book, up until the point when this litigation commenced. Only after the litigation
began did he take any substantial steps toward considering publication of the book. On this issue, Plaintiffs rely on the
Second Circuit's decision in Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132 (2d Cir.1998) , where the

Page 426

court stated that ""[i]Jt would . . . not serve the ends of the Copyright Act— i.e., to advance the arts—if the artists were denied
their monopoly over derivative versions of their creative works merely because they made the artistic decision not to

saturate those markets with variations of their original."" /d. at 146.

Plaintiffs’ reliance, however, is misplaced. Castle Rock concerned a plaintiff that had, and continued to, exploit its
copyright over the Seinfeld television program and derivative markets. /d. at 136. The only issue in that case was whether a
decision to not exploit one particular derivative market should be respected. The underlying facts of the case at hand are
substantially different. Warren not only failed to use his copyright to exploit a particular derivative market, but he has both
failed to exploit any derivative market and failed to even exploit the copyrights in their entirety for the past several decades.
This is not a case of a court's need to respect the artistic decisions of the copyright owner who decides to exploit one
derivative market but not another; instead, this is a case where the copyright owner has exhibited virtually no interest at all in
utilizing his copyrights. It would defy logic for this Court to accept Warren's argument that, where a copyright owner has
failed to utilize his copyrights for several decades, a district court's prohibition of a defendant's productive and transformative
use serves copyright's ""purpose, ‘[t]lo promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts ...."""" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 (quoting U.S. Const, art. |, § 8). This alone places the fourth factor in favor of Spurlock.

Nonetheless, assuming that it does somehow serve the purposes of copyright to prevent others from utilizing a
copyright that was deserted decades ago, the parties have offered several pieces of evidence in support of their arguments
on the fourth factor. Spurlock, who has the burden to satisfy the fair use defense and the four factors, offers a number of
individuals’ testimony in support of his argument that the market for the coffee-table book was not harmed by the Gogos
Book.

+ Robert Greenberger, who is an agent of Philip Kim, the current owner of the Famous Monsters of Filmland
trademark, testified that the Gogos Book did not ""adversely affect[ ] my interest, Mr. [Philip] Kim's interest, or the
interest of Abrams [a publisher] in publishing a coffee table book celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the original
Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine."" (Greenberger Aff. 4 8). 2° Kim and Greenberger had previously
expressed some interest in working on the coffee-table book.

+ Jon Cooke, Warren's supposed ""project manager"" for the coffee-table book, also testified that he did not

believe any publication adversely affected Mr. Warren's right to license Famous Monsters. (Cooke Dep. 59:23-
60:19).

* Charles Kochman, the only publisher that Warren or a person acting on behalf of Warren ever approached,
testified that he believes the Gogos Book did not have any impact on the market for a book about Famous
Monsters, (Kochman Aff. 44 12, 13). 21 , 22

Page 427

In response to Spurlock's evidence, Plaintiffs make several arguments concerning the fourth factor. Many of those
arguments, however, miss the mark. Plaintiffs first argue that this Court should use a ""functional test,"" offered in the

respected treatise Nimmer on Copyright, to determine whether the market was harmed. This test relies on one prong of the
first factor, whether the work is transformative, in coming to a conclusion on whether there was market impact. See 4


--- Page 15 ---
Nimmer on Copyright, § 13.05[B][1], at 13-206 (""In determining the effect of the defendant's use upon the potential market
for or value of the plaintiffs work, a comparison must be made not merely of the media in which the two works may appear,
but rather in terms of the function of each such work regardless of media.""). However, Plaintiffs have not identified any cases
where courts have adopted this test, and a review of the Third Circuit and Supreme Court cases shows that neither of these
courts has done so. Even if this test was applied, this Court would conclude that the function of Plaintiffs' use of the
magazine covers is distinctly different than the function of Spurlock's use in the Gogos Book, for the same reasons that were
discussed in the first factor analysis.

Next, Plaintiffs rely on evidence to establish that there is a valuable market for Famous Monsters derivative works. 2°

But Spurlock does not dispute this issue, and he repeatedly notes that a Famous Monsters coffee-table book would be
readily accepted by a publisher (though he insists that the Gogos Book does not impact the market for such a book).

Plaintiffs also offer a statement by one of their experts, Dennis Kitchen, that, if the Gogos Book does poorly, this would
poison the market for the Famous Monsters coffee-table book. (Kitchen Rep. § 13). Even if this is true, Plaintiffs did not point
to any evidence that speaks to the premise of his conclusion—whether the Gogos Book sold poorly.

Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the market for the coffee-table book is likely usurped since the Gogos Book would
probably be placed beside a Famous Monsters coffee-table book in the bookstore, or would show up together as results for
likely-used keywords in an online bookstore search. Yet, Plaintiffs did not offer any testimony or evidence in support of either
of these assertions.

Plaintiffs provide several statements on the fourth factor that do address the relevant issue:

- Warren states in his declaration that ""Defendant's visually-oriented book— which is based on substantial part
on the covers and original artwork of Plaintiffs' Famous Monsters of Filmland magazines, has been published
first and is still publicly available—has preempted Plaintiffs' own plans for a book comprising and featuring the
covers and original artwork of their Famous Monsters of Filmland magazines."" (Warren Decl. 12). 4

+ Kitchen states that ""[t]he book Famous Monster Movie Art of Basil Gogos, having been published first and
containing a substantial amount of covers and cover art from Famous Monsters

Page 428

of Filmland, likely hampers Warren's plans for a book featuring the covers and cover art of Warren's Famous
Monsters of Filmland magazines."" (Kitchen Rep. { 9). 7

* Samuel Kursh, Plaintiffs' other expert, concluded that, in considering the evidence in the light favorable to
Plaintiffs, ""Warren has been permanently precluded from exploiting the intellectual property as a result of
Spurlock's alleged infringement, [and] the loss of opportunity would approximate the value of the property or $1
million."" (Kursh Rep. § 59).

Warren's complete failure to exploit his copyrights for approximately 22 years substantially detracts from his argument
on the fourth factor. The parties' opposing arguments and supporting evidence on the other market factors are largely based
on opinions as to what would have occurred if certain events had taken place. All these conflicting opinions are to a large
degree speculative. They do create a genuine issue of fact as to whether the fourth factor is in favor of Plaintiffs or Spurlock.
Weighing Plaintiffs' sheer neglect of the copyrights, against the result of making all factual inferences in favor of Plaintiffs as
to the other facts as must be done on summary judgment, based on Warren's own testimony and the supporting testimony
from others, the Court finds that the fourth factor slightly favors Plaintiffs. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 591 n. 21, 114 S.Ct.
1164 (""Market harm is a matter of degree, and the importance of this factor will vary, not only with the amount of harm, but
also with the relative strength of the showing on the other factors."").

6. Consideration of All Fair Use Factors

This Court concludes that the fair use factors, considered as a whole, weigh in favor of Spurlock. The strong weight of
the first and third factors in favor of Spurlock, along with the limited relevance of the second factor, warrant a finding on fair
use for the Defendant, despite the disputed facts on the fourth factor, which, when inferred in favor of Plaintiffs, slightly
favors Plaintiffs.

It is important to again recognize that the four factors are not ""a score card that promises victory to the winner of the
majority."" Video Pipeline, 342 F.3d at 198 (quoting Leval, supra, at 1110). The fair use factors are ""to be explored, and the
results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."" /d. (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).
After weighing the factors together and considering the purposes of copyright, this Court determines that the fair use
defense is appropriate here. The fact that the Gogos Book is inherently biographical render it so fundamentally
transformative in nature, coupled with the fact that Spurlock utilized such a quantitatively and qualitatively minor portion of
the magazines, requires this Court to conclude that Spurlock's use is fair use and to grant Spurlock's motion for summary
judgment on the copyright claims.

IV. Unfair Competition


--- Page 16 ---
Spurlock also moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ state law unfair competition claim. In Count II of their
Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs argue that the name of the Gogos Book, Famous Monster Movie Art of Basil Gogos, suggests
an affiliation with the Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine and uses the ""goodwill and reputation"" that Plaintiffs have
garnered with the ""success and favorable public acceptance and recognition"" of the Famous Monsters magazine.

Page 429
A. Principles of Analyzing Unfair Competition Claim

The threshold issue for Count II is determining what principles govern an unfair competition claim. Despite several
cases identifying standards to be used on these claims, there is no clear precedent on which standard is the appropriate one
for this case. Though in many ways the standards are analytically similar, if not identical, there are at least three different
standards that courts have used.

First, Spurlock argues that the unfair competition claim should be analyzed as if it was a Lanham Act claim of unfair
competition. Many judges in this District have adopted this view and directly held that ""[t]he elements of an unfair competition
claim under Pennsylvania common law are identical to those required under the Lanham Act, except that no showing
regarding interstate commerce is necessary under Pennsylvania law."" Allen-Myland. Inc. v. IBM Corp., 746 F.Supp. 520 ,
552-53 (E.D.Pa.1990) (O'Neill, J.) (utilizing Lanham Act standard for counterclaim where defendant argued that plaintiff
engaged in unfair competition by ""affixing counterfeit IBM labels to copies of the 3090 microcode which it made and
distributed to customers; and by displaying IBM's copyright notice on the 3090 system operator console screen when a 3090
system powers up using [the counterclaim defendant's] copied 3090 microcode""). 26

The second standard used for unfair competition focuses on whether the defendant was ""passing off' a good as if it was
produced by the plaintiff. As Judge Brody explained in Bldg. Materials Corp. of Am. v. Rotter. 535 F.Supp.2d 518 (E.D.Pa.
2008) (Brody, J.), ""[a] claim of unfair competition under Pennsylvania law requires proof that the defendant has ‘passed off
the goods of one manufacturer or vendor as those of another, thus creating confusion between his own goods, and those of
the rival."" /d. at 526 n. 4 (quoting Scanvec Amiable Ltd. v. Chang, 80 Fed.Appx. 171, 180 (3d Cir.2003), citing to Pa. State
Univ. v. Univ. Orthopedics, Ltd., 706 A.2d 863 , 870-71 (Pa.Super.Ct.1998)); see also Mainardi v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.,
2009 WL 229757, at *9-10 (E.D.Pa. Jan.30, 2009) (Pratter, J.). 27

Page 430

Finally, the third standard utilized for a common law unfair competition claim comes from the Restatement (Third) of
Unfair Competition: ""In recent years, the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas has begun to define unfair competition
according to its definition in the Restatement (Third) Unfair Competition § 1 (1995)."" Rotter, 535 F.Supp.2d at 526 n. 4 (citing
Babiarz v. Bell Atl.-Pa., Inc., 2001 WL 1808554, at *9 (Pa.Com.PI. July 10, 2001); Lakeview Ambulance & Med. Servs., Inc.

v. Gold Cross Ambulance & Med. Servs., Inc., 1995 WL 842000 (Pa.Com.PI. Oct.18, 1995)). 28 The Restatement provides
that:

One who causes harm to the commercial relations of another by engaging in a business or trade is not subject to
liability to the other for such harm unless:

(a) the harm results from acts or practices of the actor actionable by the other under the rules of this
Restatement relating to:

(1) deceptive marketing, as specified in Chapter Two;
(2) infringement of trademarks and other indicia of identification, as specified in Chapter Three;

(3) appropriation of intangible trade values including trade secrets and the right of publicity, as specified in
Chapter Four;

or from other acts or practices of the actor determined to be actionable as an unfair method of competition, taking
into account the nature of the conduct and its

Page 431
likely effect on both the person seeking relief and the public.
Restatement § 1.

Despite the fact that there is no clear precedent on what standard applies, this Court concludes that Lanham Act
principles are appropriately applied in this case. In considering the foregoing review of modern unfair competition cases,
those cases applying the Lanham Act, the plaintiffs generally argue that the defendant has utilized a name, title, or ""mark""
that is associated with the plaintiff, with the intent of falsely linking the defendant's product with the plaintiff and capitalizing
on the plaintiffs goodwill. On the other hand, where courts apply principles other than the Lanham Act, the plaintiffs claim
typically consists of allegations that the defendant was engaged in some ""unfair"" trade practice, other than appropriating the
plaintiffs ""mark.""


--- Page 17 ---
Two cases in particular require some additional consideration. First, the Third Circuit's decision in Scanvec could be
interpreted as a case where the defendants appropriated a mark owned by the plaintiff. However, several factors underlie
this Court's hesitation to apply the Third Circuit's non-precedential decision to the facts at hand. Scanvec first determined
that the unfair competition claim was not sufficiently preserved on appeal. 80 Fed. Appx. at 180. Despite the fact that the
court could not ""determine the factual and legal basis for Amica's purported appeal,"" id., the court proceeded to consider
what principle was appropriately applied in that case. In addition, the allegations in Scanvec were not limited to
misrepresentation of ownership of the defendant's product, but included claims that the defendants utilized valuable
intellectual property from the plaintiffs software and that the defendants took over the plaintiffs distribution network.

The other case that requires some consideration is the Pennsylvania Superior Court's decision in Pa. State. Though
the allegations in that case—that the defendant's inclusion of the term ""university"" in its company name misleads the public
into believing there is an affiliation with Penn State University—are comparable to the facts here, the court explicitly
recognized in that case that federal principles are effective in considering an unfair competition claim. 706 A.2d at 870 . By
no means can the Superior Court's opinion be characterized as a rejection of Lanham Act principles for unfair competition
claims.

Scanvecand Pa. State are distinguishable, and in light of the many analytically identical cases discussed above that
use the Lanham Act in coming to a decision, this Court will use the Lanham Act in considering Plaintiffs' common law unfair
competition claim against Spurlock.

B. Principles Under the Lanham Act

In Spurlock's Motion for Summary Judgment, he analyzes Plaintiffs' unfair competition claim in the context of the
Lanham Act. Spurlock first argues that Warren can not pursue this claim since the trademark on Famous Monsters of
Filmlandis now owned by Philip Kim, not Warren.

Plaintiffs do not contest Kim's ownership of the trademark in their Response. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that they still have
a protectable, or a common law, right to the name under the Lanham Act. While Spurlock does not challenge the fact that
Plaintiffs at one time had a common law right to the name, he argues that Plaintiffs are precluded from pursuing a claim both
because a third party now owns the registered trademark and because Plaintiffs abandoned ownership of the mark when

Warren ceased publication of the Famous Monsters Magazine.

Page 432

This Court recently recognized the elements of an unfair competition claim under the Lanham Act in AFL Philadelphia
LLC v. Krause, 639 F.Supp.2d 512 , 520-21, 2009 WL 1562992, at *4 (E.D.Pa. June 4, 2009) (Baylson, J.):

(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in
commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of
origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which—

(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association
of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or
commercial activities by another person, . . . shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or
she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.

15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A). ""Overall, *[t]he Lanham Act was intended to make actionable the deceptive and misleading
use of marks and to protect persons engaged in . .. commerce against unfair competition."" Krause, 639 F.Supp.2d at 521 ,
2009 WL 1562992, at *4 (quoting_Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763 , 767-68, 112 S.Ct. 2753 , 120
L.Ed.2d 615 (1992) ). This particular section of the Lanham Act ""protects qualifying unregistered trademarks, and the
general principles to qualify a registered mark are largely applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark qualifies
for protection under Section 43(a)."" /d. (quoting Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768 , 112 S.Ct. 2753 ). A plaintiff pursuing a claim
under this section must provide evidence to establish that ""(a) the mark is valid and legally protectable, (b) it owns the mark,
and (c) the defendant's use of the mark to identify goods or services causes a likelihood of confusion."" /d. (citing Freedom
Card, Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 432 F.3d 463 , 470 (3d Cir.2005)).

However, Spurlock has not challenged Plaintiffs’ ability to satisfy the elements of the Lanham Act at the time the
Famous Monsters magazine was published, but instead contends both that: (a) a third party, Philip Kim, now owns the
trademark, which precludes Plaintiffs from claiming that they ""own"" the mark; and (b) that, while Plaintiffs did have at least a
""common law"" right to the mark back when the Famous Monsters magazine was published, Plaintiffs abandoned ownership
of the mark when publication of the Magazine ended in 1983.

C. Third Party Ownership of the Mark

Spurlock's first argument is that Plaintiffs do not have standing to pursue the claim since Plaintiffs are no longer owners
of the trademark. Spurlock contends that even though there may be some association of the Gogos Book title with the

Famous Monsters Magazine, ""if Defendant were liable to anyone for Trademark Infringement, it would be Philip Kim—the


--- Page 18 ---
owner of the Federal Trademark Registration—not Plaintiffs."" Plaintiffs respond by arguing that, under the Lanham Act, a
plaintiff need not own the trademark to successfully pursue the claim, even where a third party does own the registered
trademark. In addition, Plaintiffs claim that the appropriate analysis is whether the plaintiffs right to the mark is superior to
the defendant's, not whether plaintiffs is superior to any other person's.

As Plaintiffs note in their brief, Spurlock's argument concerning the rights of a third party has been termed a jus tertii

defense. A party makes a jus tertii argument in a trademark case when the ""[d]efendant in effect argues that, ""Somebody
has a right to sue me, but it's not you.”

Page 433

The Second Circuit has disfavored this defense."" General Cigar Co., Inc. v. G.D.M., Inc. 988 F.Supp. 647 , 661
(S.D.N.Y.1997) (Sweet, J.) (quoting 6 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 31:157, at
31-240 (1996) (hereinafter ""McCarthy on Trademarks"" )). From a review of the cases that discuss this defense, Professor
McCarthy's trademark treatise appears to be the leading authority on this issue. In his discussion of jus tertii, Professor
McCarthy states that ""[mJodern decisions have rejected a jus tertii defense in trademark litigation."" 6 McCarthy on
Trademarks § 31:160 (citing Tex. Tech Univ. v. Spiegelberg, 461 F.Supp.2d 510 (N.D.Tex. 2006) ; Bishops Bay Founders
Group, Inc. v. Bishops Bay Apartments, LLC, 301 F.Supp.2d 901 (W.D.Wis.2003) ; General Cigar Co., 988 F.Supp. 647 ).
He also illustrates how a court's acceptance of this argument would lead to negative consequences: A court's permission of

jus tertii""would expand many trademark disputes far beyond a mere two-party conflict. Before plaintiff could prevail, it would
have to prove that it was not an infringer of one or more third parties that the defendant can conjure up. . .. A case could be

expanded beyond reasonable bounds and effectively slowed to a crawl."" 6 McCarthy on Trademarks § 31:160.

As Plaintiffs also note, Plaintiffs need not own a registered trademark for the mark at issue to prevail in their Lanham
Act claim, even where another party does own one. The most recent case to address this issue is Dallas Cowboys Football

Club, Ltd. v. Am.'s Team Props., Inc.,.616 F.Supp.2d 622 (N.D.Tex.2009) . In that case, the court recognized that an
individual's ownership of a trademark does not necessarily prevent another party from asserting priority.

It is a fundamental premise that ""[t]he exclusive right to a trademark belongs to one who first uses it in connection
with specified goods."" Blue Bell v. Farah Mfg.. Inc., 508 F.2d 1260 , 1265 (5th Cir.1975). Proof of registration of a
trademark is only prima facie evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark in commerce for the
services specified in the registration. 15 U.S.C. § 1115(a). Such proof does ""not preclude another person from
proving any legal or equitable defense or defect ... which might have been asserted if such mark had not been
registered."" Id. Therefore, the registrant is granted a presumption of ownership, dating to the filing date of the
application for federal registration, and the challenger must overcome this presumption by a preponderance of
the evidence.

Id. at 632-33. ""Neither application for nor registration of a mark at the federal level wipes out the prior nonregistered,
common law rights of others. ... Thus, in a priority dispute between a senior common law user and a second-in-time [intent-

to-use] applicant, the senior common law user will prevail."" /d. at 633 (quoting 2 McCarthy on Trademarks § 16:18.50).

In the Dallas Cowboys case, there was a dispute between the Dallas Cowboys, who claimed common law ownership to
the term ""America's Team,"" and the company ""America's Team Properties, Inc.,"" which purchased the registered trademark
to that name some years after the team started using the phrase. The court held that the football team ""acquired common
law rights in the ‘America's Team' mark more than a decade before Defendant's predecessor in interest. Thus, the Cowboys

have trademark priority."" /d. at 634. In the absence of Third Circuit law on these issues, this Court will adopt the principles of
these cases.

Both of Spurlock's arguments for this defense have been rejected by prior

Page 434

courts, and he has not offered any caselaw to suggest otherwise. Therefore, Kim's ownership of the trademark Famous
Monsters of Filmland will not be considered for purposes of Spurlock's Motion for Summary Judgment.

D. Abandonment of the Mark
1. Principles on Doctrine of Abandonment

Next, Spurlock argues that even if Plaintiffs can pursue their unfair competition claim where a third party owns the
trademark, any common law rights that Plaintiffs once had were abandoned by non-use of the mark over many years.
Spurlock contends that Plaintiffs have not used the Famous Monsters of Filmland mark since 1983, when the magazine
ceased publication, and that Warren's appearances at tradeshows along with third-party resale of the magazine are not
sufficient for Plaintiffs to avoid abandonment of the mark. Plaintiffs respond by arguing that Warren also has used the mark
as a means to sell memorabilia at movie-monster conventions and that the mark currently retains an association with the
magazine and Warren.


--- Page 19 ---
Under the Lanham Act, a mark is considered abandoned when either:

(1) ""its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use. Intent not to resume may be inferred from
circumstances. Nonuse for 3 consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment. ‘Use’ of a mark
means the bona fide use of such mark made in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a
right in a mark""; or

(2) ""any course of conduct of the owner, including acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to
become the generic name for the goods or services on or in connection with which it is used or otherwise to lose
its significance as a mark. Purchaser motivation shall not be a test for determining abandonment under this
paragraph.""

15 U.S.C. § 1127. 28 As Judge (now Justice) Alito explained in Marshak v. Treadwell, 240 F.3d 184 (3d Cir.2001) , ""[t]o
establish the defense of abandonment it is necessary to show not only acts indicating a practical abandonment, but an
actual intent to abandon."" /d. at 198 (quoting Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19 , 31,21 S.Ct. 7 ,45 L.Ed.
60 (1900) ). As the statute indicates, however, the requisite intent ""maybe inferred from circumstances.""/d. (quoting § 1127).
""[A]bandonment, being in the nature of a forfeiture, must be strictly proved.""_Doeblers' Pennsylvania Hybrids, Inc. v. Doebler,
442 F.3d 812 , 822 (3d Cir.2006) (reversing grant of summary judgment on abandonment where mark was continuously
used by licensee).

2. Cases Relied on by Spurlock

In support of Spurlock's abandonment argument, be cites Kusek v. Family Circle, Inc., 894 F.Supp. 522 (D.Mass.1995)
. In Kusek, the plaintiff created and published a book of recipes that included the trademark ""Speed Cooking,"" though the
mark was not registered. The defendant magazine, Family Circle, became aware of the book and requested copies for a
possible article concerning the plaintiff and her book. Though nothing ever became of the magazine article profiling the
plaintiff, Family Circle published articles using the mark Speed Cooking, without any acknowledgment that it came from the
plaintiff; Family Circle eventually registered the mark. The plaintiff filed suit, alleging,

Page 435

inter alia, trademark infringement. On a motion for summary judgment, Family Circle challenged the plaintiffs ability to satisfy
the statute of limitations, which was based on Family Circle's last ""use"" of the mark in commerce.

The district court, holding that ""use"" for purposes of the statute of limitations was identical to the ""use"" considered in
abandonment, 894 F.Supp. at 533 , rejected the plaintiffs argument that the sale of back magazine issues was sufficient to

constitute ""use,"" id. After reciting the general principles of abandonment, the court held that ""Family Circle's inconsequential
use of the trademark Speed Cooking, were it making back issues available, cannot forestall abandonment."" /d.

""To prove bona fide usage, the proponent of the trademark must demonstrate that use of the mark has been
deliberate and continuous, not sporadic, casual or transitory."" La Societe Anonyme des Parfums Le Galion v.
Jean Patou, Inc., 495 F.2d 1265 , 1271-72 (2d Cir.1974). ... In essence, nominal or residual use is not sufficient
to avoid abandonment._See Hiland Potato Chip Co. v. Culbro Snack Foods, Inc., 720 F.2d 981 , 984 (8th
Cir.1983) (resale of returned potato chips not sufficient use to avoid abandonment). Minimal use of a mark, which
use is not part of an ""ongoing program to exploit the mark"" is insufficient to vest a party with trademark rights.
Anvil Brand, Inc. v. Consolidated Foods Corp., 464 F.Supp. 474 , 481 (S.D.N.Y.1978), citing La Societe
Anonyme des Parfums Le Galion v. Jean Patou, Inc., supra.

894 F.Supp. at 533. Because the ""availability of back magazine issues is indistinguishable from such nominal,
inconsequential uses,"" id., the court determined that the last ""use"" for purposes of the statute of limitations could not be
measured with the sale of these back issues, id.

Spurlock appropriately analogizes Kusek to the facts here. The evidence offered by Spurlock establishes that Warren's
attempts to ""exploit the mark"" prior to Spurlock's use were limited to his sporadic attendance at trade conventions, where he
would sell back magazine issues or Famous Monsters paraphernalia that were in his personal collection, and his
consideration of a Famous Monsters coffee table book. The sale of back Famous Monster issues is identical to the ""use""
offered by the plaintiff in Kusek, which the court rejected. Any personal memorabilia that Warren may have sold from his
personal collection is no different than back issues of the magazine. And the evidence concerning the coffee table book
demonstrates that Warren has yet to actually ""exploit the mark."" The only acts that he has taken in furtherance of the book
has been limited to sketching ideas and talking the issue over with colleagues. As Kusek correctly recognizes, this type of
act is not the type of ""bona fide use"" the statute requires, and it is therefore not enough to avoid abandonment of the mark.

3. Whether Lanham Act Prima Facie Abandonment Presumption Applies
There is a brief, but significant, disagreement between the parties as to whether the statutory presumption of

abandonment upon three years of nonuse is applicable here. As the statute is currently written, § 1127 states that ""[nlonuse
for 3 consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment."" At one point, the statute provided for the


--- Page 20 ---
presumption where there was nonuse for two consecutive years._ See Emergency One. Inc. v. Am. FireEagle, Ltd., 228 F.3d
531 , 536 n. 1 (4th Cir.2000) (""Effective January 1, 1996, Congress amended § 1127, changing the period of non-use that
establishes a prima facie case of abandonment from two

Page 436
years to the present standard of three years."").

The complicating factor in this case concerns the fact that Plaintiffs are asserting a claim to common law ownership of
the mark ""Famous Monsters of Filmland,""rather than ownership based on a registered trademark. From a review of the
caselaw and McCarthy on Trademarks, there appears to be no consensus on whether the rebuttal presumption of
abandonment applies to common law ownership of marks._Compare Koppers Co. v. Krupp-Koppers GmbH, 517 F.Supp.
836 , 854 (W.D.Pa.1981) (""The K-T marks are not registered under federal law. Therefore the two-year discontinuance
presumption of the Lanham Act does not apply to Koppers Co.'s rights to the marks.""), with 3 McCarthy on Trademarks §
17:21 (""This presumption has even been applied to an unregistered common law trademark."" (citing Miller Brewing Co. v.
Oland's Breweries (1971), Ltd., 548 F.2d 349 (C.C.P.A. 1976) )); Gen. Healthcare Ltd. v. Qashat, 364 F.3d 332 , 336 (1st
Cir.2004) (affirming district court's grant of summary judgment on abandonment by applying three year nonuse presumption
of abandonment to a common law mark).

If this prima facie abandonment rule applies to common law marks, it is clear to this Court that Plaintiffs have failed to
rebut the presumption with sufficient evidence, and Plaintiffs therefore abandoned the Famous Monsters mark. The
presumption of abandonment serves to ""shift the burden of production to the mark owner to come forward with evidence
indicating that, despite three years of non-use, it intended to resume use of the mark within a reasonably foreseeable time.
The ultimate burden of persuasion . . . remains . . . with the alleged infringer.""_/TC Ltd. v. Punchgini. Inc., 482 F.3d 135 , 148
(2d Cir.2007). Where the mark owner seeks to rebut the presumption, the evidence of the ""mark holder's intent to resume
use of the mark must be formulated during the three-year period of non-use."" /d. at 149 n. 9.

In ITC, the plaintiff company owned several successful restaurants throughout the world, all named and based off of its
restaurant in India named ""Bukhara."" ITC opened a restaurant with the Bukhara mark in New York City in 1986, opened
another in Chicago in 1987, and registered the Bukhara mark for restaurant services that same year. However, the
restaurants only remained open for a few years; the New York restaurant closed in 1991, and the Chicago restaurant closed
in 1997. After 1997, Bukhara did not use the mark for restaurants in the United States and only resumed its use in 2003 for
the sale of packaged food products. In 1999, several former employees of the plaintiff opened two restaurants, which bore
the Bukhara mark and were specifically designed to copy the plaintiffs restaurants. ITC filed suit in 2003 for, inter alia,
trademark infringement and unfair competition under the Lanham Act. The district court granted the defendants' motion for
summary judgment on the issue of abandonment, and ITC appealed. On appeal, ITC conceded that the defendants had
established that the mark had not been used in the United States since 1997, thereby triggering the statutory presumption of
abandonment, but argued that there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether it intended to resume use of the mark. /d. at
147.

The court first noted that ITC's blanket assertion of an intent to resume use during the nonuse period was insufficient to
rebut the statutory presumption, stating that the mark owner must instead ""come forward with evidence ‘with respect to...
what outside events occurred from which an intent to resume use during the nonuse period may reasonably be inferred."" /d.
at

Page 437

150 (quoting Imperial Tobacco, Ltd. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 899 F.2d 1575 , 1581 (2d Cir.1990)). ITC offered four different sets
of evidence in support of its intent to resume use of the mark: (1) overly burdensome Indian regulations and depressed
market conditions for restaurants, ""(2) its efforts to develop and market a Dal Bukhara line of packaged food, (3) its attempts
to identify potential United States restaurant franchisees, and (4) its continued use of the Bukhara mark for restaurants

outside the United States."" /d. at 151.

As to the first, the court held that there was no evidence that the regulations of India were too burdensome for the
restaurants to operate, and that there was no evidence of a decline in the United States hospitality market. /d. at 151-52. As
to the second, the court found that the only evidence within the three-year period of nonuse was a meeting minute indicating
an intent to sell food products under the name ""Bukhara Dal,"" though the minutes did not reflect an intent to sell the
products in the United States or to resume use of the mark for Untied States restaurants. /d. at 152. As to the third, the court
held that the business proposals ITC received, with no evidence of serious consideration by the plaintiff, were also

insufficient. /d. at 152-53. Finally, the court held that use of the mark outside the United States could not show an intent to
use the mark inside the United States. /d. at 153. The court determined that ITC abandoned the mark and affirmed the
district court's grant of summary judgment. /d.

The /TC opinion is an effective guide as to how Warren failed to rebut the presumption of abandonment, if the statutory
presumption applies to common law marks. From 1983 until 2006, as will be more thoroughly discussed below, the evidence

offered by Spurlock establishes that Warren failed to make any ""bona fide use"" of the Famous Monsters mark in commerce.


--- Page 21 ---
30 Instead, the mark was completely removed from commerce after the Famous Monsters magazine ceased publication in
1983. There are several three-year periods, then, after 1983 that this Court could identify for the statutory presumption. For
instance, from 1983 until 1986, the evidence offered by Spurlock, and which Warren failed to rebut, indicates that there was
no bona fide commercial use of the mark. The same could be said of any other three-year period up to 2006. The only
evidence offered by Warren—two attempts to protect the mark from third-party use, Warren's occasional attendance at trade
conventions to sell back issues, and his contemplation of publishing a coffee-table book—do not indicate an ""ongoing
program to exploit the mark"" and are therefore not adequate usage.

Because Spurlock can readily establish a three-year period of nonuse, Plaintiffs would then be required to rebut the
presumption by producing evidence that ""that, despite three years of non-use, it intended to resume use of the mark within a
reasonably foreseeable time."" /TC, 482 F.3d at 148 . Warren has failed to do so. Each

Page 438

piece of evidence offered by Plaintiffs only indicates an intent to protect the mark (not to resume use of it), an intent to
engage in sporadic sales of personal memorabilia or back magazine issues (which Kusek recognizes is not bona fide
usage), or insubstantial consideration of publishing this coffee-table book. This last piece of evidence is an important one,
since it is the focus of Plaintiffs’ claims of intent to resume use. However, the /TC court's handling of evidence similar to
what Warren offers here, business proposals to exploit the mark that ITC never seriously considered, indicates that simple
business proposals or ideas do not independently prove sufficient intent. /TC, 482 F.3d at 152-53 (""[NJo evidence indicates
that ITC responded to or seriously considered these unsolicited proposals in a manner that would permit a reasonable jury
to infer its intent to resume use of its Bukhara mark for restaurants.""). Rather, an intent to resume use of the mark can only
come from evidence that shows a genuine and substantial consideration of a business idea where use of the mark would be
resumed. Warren's coffee-table book simply does not rise to that level.

In sum, the evidence offered by Spurlock would trigger the statutory presumption of nonuse, and Warren would be
unable to rebut the presumption with the evidence offered here. Therefore, if Warren's common law ownership of the

Famous Monsters mark was subject to the three-year nonuse statutory presumption of abandonment, the evidence on the
record establishes that Warren abandoned the mark.

4. Cases Relied on by Plaintiffs

However, as discussed above, there is no binding precedent as to whether the statutory presumption applies to
common law marks. The facts will be considered in the alternative under the general principles of abandonment.

In support of their argument that Warren did not abandon the Famous Monsters mark, Plaintiffs rely on three cases:
Ferrari S.p.A. Esercizio Fabbriche Automobili e Corse v. McBurnie, 1989 WL 298658 (S.D.Cal. June 1, 1989), Skippy. Inc. v.
CPC Int'l, Inc.. 674 F.2d 209 (4th Cir. 1982) , cert. denied, 459 U.S. 969 , 103 S.Ct. 298 , 74 L.Ed.2d 280 (1982) , and

Marshak v. Treadwell, 240 F.3d 184 (3d Cir.2001) . Initially, it should be noted that none of these cases concern summary
judgment motions.

In Ferrari, the court granted an injunction in a Lanham Act claim after trial, and found that the car manufacturer Ferrari
never abandoned its ownership of the mark ""Daytona Spyder."" Ferrari produced a car from 1966 to 1974 known as the
Daytona Spyder. The Sypder was a very popular and successful model until the end of its production, when Ferrari limited
sales to replacement parts for the cars. While the number of cars produced was limited, the Daytona Spyder received high
praise from car enthusiasts and critics in books and magazines even after the end of production. The defendant company
attempted to replicate Ferrari's design by selling kits that would convert cheaper automobiles into the design of a Daytona
Spyder without the Ferrari logo. The defendant argued that Ferrari had abandoned the mark when it ceased production of
the car in 1974. The court rejected the defendant's abandonment argument on the basis of Ferrari's supply of replacement
parts, its refurbishment and service of the existing cars, and the strong public association that Daytona Spyder had with
Ferrari. ""[T]he court finds that Ferrari never intended to abandon its rights in or use of the DAYTONA SPYDER trade dress
and has not abandoned its rights. Ferrari's continuous use of its trade dress has been made in good faith and for valid
commercial

Page 439
reasons."" 11 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1849 , 1989 WL 298658.

Despite Plaintiffs' emphasis on this case, it is not sufficiently supportive of Plaintiffs’ argument. The evidence in Ferrari
suggested that Ferrari's decision to end production of the Daytona Spyder was not due to a lack of demand or an attempt to
forfeit its rights to the mark. Rather, the evidence indicated that the car was a very successful model and that Ferrari limited
the production for strategic purposes. Even after production was ended, Ferrari continued to maintain the cars and create
replacement parts for a substantial period of time. The district judge, in granting the injunction, found that Ferrari vigorously
retained its common law rights to the mark despite ending production.

The evidence offered by Warren, on the other hand, suggests an effort that pales in comparison to Ferrari's. Since the
end of production of Famous Monsters in the early 1980's, Warren has taken virtually no action to retain his common law
ownership of the mark. Indeed, for almost 25 years, he has not published another issue of the magazine and has not


--- Page 22 ---
engaged in a substantial attempt to sell memorabilia or anything else with the Famous Monsters name. And though there
are no ""replacement parts"" for Famous Monsters magazines as there were in Ferrari, Warren provided no evidence of any
substantial activity that he engaged in during the past two and a half decades sufficient to retain his rights to the mark.

Plaintiffs also direct this Court's attention to Skippy. In that case, a peanut butter manufacturer, CPC, sought a
declaratory judgment that the defendant, Skippy, Inc., abandoned its rights to the mark ""Skippy."" Skippy, Inc. had previously
produced a syndicated comic strip, depicting the stories of a child named ""Skippy,"" and derivative products, including lunch
boxes and books. Skippy, Inc. registered the trademark to ""Skippy"" in 1925, and it ended syndication of the comic strip in
1945 when the trademark expired. However, Skippy, Inc. attempted to continue commercializing the trademark through
1980 with limited success. CPC, the plaintiff company, produced Skippy peanut butter and it sought to declare Skippy, Inc.'s
rights to the ""Skippy"" mark as abandoned. In considering the claim on appeal from a non-jury trial, the court focused on
several of Skippy, Inc.'s activities: ""Skippy, Inc. submitted evidence showing that it continued to attempt to market the Skippy
cartoon character and concept after 1945, that the Board of Directors of Skippy, Inc. met occasionally after 1945, and that
Skippy, Inc. reemerged as an active company after Tibbetts became president in 1968."" 674 F.2d at 216 . On the basis of
this evidence, the appellate court sustained the district court's finding that ""Skippy, Inc. did not intend to abandon its

trademark."" /d.

Skippy similarly fails to sufficiently support Plaintiffs’ case. Skippy, Inc. did not totally cease its attempts to exploit the
Skippy mark. Instead, Skippy, Inc. held board meetings and retained an advertising company in an attempt to increase its
revenue. Though its attempts met with limited success, it still actively sought to retain its right to the Skippy mark. Once the
new president, Tibbetts, took over, its activity became even more substantial. Here, Warren did not engage an advertising
agency, did not hold corporate meetings, and made only isolated attempts to exploit the Famous Monsters mark in
commerce.

The final case Plaintiffs rely on is the Third Circuit's opinion in Marshak. Marshak concerned the rights to the mark ""The
Drifters,"" which was a popular singing group during the 1950's and 1960's. The husband of the defendant was the manager
of the singing group

Page 440

during this initial period of popularity, and he controlled the rights to the name ""The Drifters,"" which the defendant, Treadwell,
assumed upon his death. In 1969, the plaintiff sought to reunite old members of The Drifters for a reunion concert in
affiliation with CBS Radio. The Drifters' concert was a great success, and they continued to perform under that name for
several years. In 1971, Treadwell sued Marshak for using The Drifters mark in violation of her common law right to the mark,
but the suit was eventually dismissed due to Treadwell's lack of financial resources. After the suit, Marshak's group
continued to perform and protect The Drifters mark. In 1995, Marshak initiated a suit against Treadwell for authoring a book
where she claimed that she was the sole owner of The Drifters mark, and the parties sought to litigate their disputes over
the mark. At trial, the jury found that Treadwell had initially owned common law rights to the mark, but abandoned the rights
by 1976. After the district court vacated the jury's finding on abandonment, Marshak appealed.

The Third Circuit affirmed the district court, agreeing that there was no abandonment where The Drifters' recordings
were played on the radio and in the record stores during the prior 40 years. The court agreed with the district court that ""[a]
successful musical group does not abandon its mark unless there is proof that the owner ceased to commercially exploit the
mark's secondary meaning in the music industry."" 240 F.3d at 199 . The court determined that the defendant's continuous
receipt of royalties and re-releasing the songs on compact disk amounted to a ""continuous use of the mark in connection
with the commercial exploitation of the group's recordings,"" where thereby created ""a strong inference of an intent not to
abandon the mark."" /d. With no other evidence to suggest otherwise, the court concluded that Treadwell had not abandoned
the mark. /d.

The Third Circuit's opinion in Marshak illustrates what the focus of the abandonment inquiry should be. Even though
Treadwell had failed to protect her mark through the litigation with Marshak and others, the court explained that the true
inquiry for abandonment was whether the owner attempted ""to commercially exploit the mark's secondary meaning in the []
industry."" /d. Here, Spurlock has offered sufficient and uncontested evidence to show that Warren engaged in almost no
activity that commercially exploited the Famous Monsters mark over the past two and a half decades. Other than the sale of

Famous Monsters to Harris in 1983 and the acts in pursuit of the coffee-table book after this litigation began in 2008,
Warren's only commercial exploitation has been occasional attendance at trade conventions to sell personal memorabilia.

Despite Plaintiffs’ reliance on the Marshak opinion, Warren's appearance at trade conventions clearly does not amount to, in
the words of then-Judge Alito, a ""continuous use of the mark in connection with the commercial exploitation"" of Famous
Monsters. Id. at 199. Rather, Warren's peddling is more appropriately characterized as ""nominal or residual use,"" which the
Kusek court warned was ""not sufficient to avoid abandonment."" Kusek, 894 F.Supp. at 533 (citing Hiland Potato Chip Co. v.
Culbro Snack Foods, Inc., 720 F.2d 981 , 984 (8th Cir.1983)).

5. Evidence Offered by Plaintiffs

Finally, Plaintiffs rely on the following pieces of evidence to support their argument that the Famous Monsters of
Filmland mark was not abandoned:


--- Page 23 ---
+ Famous Monsters of Filmland continues to be associated by the public with James Warren and Warren
Publishing.

Page 441

+ Warren only stopped publication of Famous Monsters in 1983 due to ill health, not with an intent to abandon the
mark. 31

+ Harris Communications paid a substantial amount of money for Warren Communications in 1983, which

included the rights to Famous Monsters. Warren later initiated a lawsuit against Harris in 1998 claiming
ownership, which was ultimately settled.

+ In 1995, Plaintiffs were in a dispute with authors of a different book, Monsters Among Us, after Plaintiffs
discovered that covers to the Famous Monsters magazine were being used in the book. Plaintiffs eventually
settled with the authors agreeing that they would not use the Famous Monsters covers.

+ Warren continues to consider making a coffee table book chronicling the history of the Famous Monsters
Magazine.

+ Warren has attended movie-monster conventions in order to sell back issues of the Famous Monsters
Magazine and related memorabilia in his personal collection, though no specific dates have been identified for
the conventions.

Nonetheless, these pieces of evidence, even assuming they are true, are insufficient to show a lack of abandonment.
Once again, ""[u]se' of a mark means the bona fide use of such mark made in the ordinary course of trade, and not made
merely to reserve a right in a mark."" 15 U.S.C. § 1127. ""Minimal use of a mark, which use is not part of an ‘ongoing program
to exploit the mark' is insufficient to vest a party with trademark rights."" Kusek, 894 F.Supp. at 533 .

A recent case from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,_PB/ Performance Prods.. Inc. v. Norfab Corp., 514 F.Supp.2d
725 (E.D.Pa.2007) (Bartle, C.J.), is also illustrative. In that case, the plaintiff, PBI, was in the business of designing and
selling heat and flame resistant fabric suitable for firefighters’ turnout gear. In 2003, PBI registered a trademark for the
physical appearance of the heat-resistant material in ""a gold background with a black checkered pattern.” /d. at 726. From
2001 to 2003, PBI advertised and distributed samples of the material in this pattern. After it became clear that a different
color scheme was more appealing to potential customers, PBI stopped its advertisement of the pattern without having made
any sales of that design. At a certain point in time, the defendant, NorFab, began selling a fabric for the same purposes in
brown with a darker brown checkered pattern. PBI alleged that NorFab's product amounted to unfair competition under the
Lanham Act on the basis of their trademark. NorFab moved for summary judgment on the unfair competition claim, arguing
that PBI had abandoned its interest in its mark from, at the very least, 2003 to 2007.

After identifying the relevant principles of abandonment, Chief Judge Bartle noted that PBI stopped advertising the at-
issue pattern ""in or before 2003."" /d. at 728. Since PBI had not identified any other use of that specific pattern since 2003,
despite asserting that it never intended to abandon the mark, the court applied the three-year presumption of abandonment.
Id. at 729. The court initially rejected PBI's contention that its lawsuit against NorFab could be used as evidence of an intent
to use the mark. /d. at 729 n. 3. As PBI failed to show that ""it has ever used the black checkered pattern for any purpose
since 2003"" and because there was no evidence of an ""intent to resume its use,"" Chief Judge Bartle held that PBI ""failed to
dispel the presumption that it abandoned its rights in the design."" /d. at 729.

Page 442

While acknowledging that the court applies the statutory presumption in PBI, there are three important points that can
be taken from Chief Judge Bartle's opinion. The first is that, in spite of the fact that PBI insisted that it never intended to
abandon the mark, the court still concluded that abandonment occurred. Second, the court's opinion makes an important
distinction between acts taken with the intent to protect rights to the mark and acts taken with the intent to make commercial
use of the mark. ""The filing of a lawsuit ... is only an indication that the plaintiff intends to protect its rights to the trademark,
not that the plaintiff intends to resume use of the mark."" PBI,_514 F.Supp.2d at 729 n. 3 (emphasis in original). Finally,
abandonment occurred for PBI's mark after only four years of nonuse.

As discussed below, the evidence offered by Spurlock, and which Plaintiffs fail to rebut, indicates that there was no
commercial use of the Famous Monsters mark between 1983 and when Spurlock published the book. Plaintiffs are only
able to point to Harris's registration of the trademark in 1991, which is not even a ""commercial use"" of the mark. This period
of nonuse is significantly longer than the time that Chief Judge Bartle found sufficient to establish abandonment.

Though the /7C case discussed earlier was also decided in the context of the statutory presumption of abandonment,
its analysis is instructive here as well. The /TC analysis again indicates that courts should not accept a mark owner's blanket
assertions regarding abandonment. Instead, courts must scrutinize the parties' assertions and identify genuinely supportive
evidence. The evidence offered by Warren to rebut Spurlock's evidence, particularly the coffee-table plans, are not genuine
and substantial enough to meet the relevant standard on abandonment.


--- Page 24 ---
As to the evidence offered by Plaintiffs, though customer association of the Famous Monsters mark with Warren may
have some relevance, such evidence does not address the abandonment test and does not rebut the evidence that Spurlock
has offered here establishing Plaintiffs' abandonment of the mark. As this Court noted in the section concerning the fourth
fair use factor for the copyright claim, Warren took no substantial action in pursuit of his hypothetical coffee-table book prior
to the initiation of this litigation. See /TC,482 F.3d at 152-53 (rejecting the plaintiffs contention that intent to resume use was
established by evidence of business proposals where there was no evidence that plaintiffs had taken a significant step in
furtherance or given serious consideration to them). In addition, though Warren engaged in a dispute with authors who used
a few covers of the magazine in their book and with Harris over the ownership to the Famous Monsters mark, this too is of
limited relevance to the abandonment inquiry. ""A lawsuit does not substitute for the required use of the mark in the
marketplace."" PBI, 514 F.Supp.2d at 729 n. 3; see also McCarthy on Trademarks § 17:11, at 17-21 (""Ordinarily, a lawsuit
against an infringing user is not a sufficient excuse for failure to use a mark. A lawsuit does not substitute for the required
use of the mark in the marketplace."").

Plaintiffs next insist that Harris's purchase of Warren Communications in 1983 for a substantial sum constitutes ""bona
fide use of such mark made in the ordinary course of trade."" However, the evidence on the record suggests that Harris never
used the Famous Monsters mark in trade, only that Harris purchased the rights to it over 25 years ago. This also says
nothing about the use after the 1983 purchase. Finally, Plaintiffs rely on Warren's sporadic attendance at trade conventions
to peddle

Page 443

some of his personal Famous Monsters memorabilia and back issues of the magazine. As discussed above, this ""nominal or
residual use"" is ""not sufficient to avoid abandonment."" Kusek,_894 F.Supp. at 533 .

This Court can not conclude, even taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, that Warren's occasional
attendance at trade conventions, along with the other activities summarized above, over a period of 25 years, constitutes an
""ongoing program to exploit"" the Famous Monsters mark. /d. The uncontroverted evidence offered by Spurlock shows that
Warren's use of the Famous Monsters mark ""has been discontinued.” 15 U.S.C. § 1127.

The same can be said of Warren's intent. Though Warren asserts that he never intended to abandon the mark,

[i]n every contested abandonment case, the respondent denies an intention to abandon its mark; otherwise there
would be no contest. Under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56, . .. one must, however, proffer more than conclusory testimony or
affidavits.... As this court has frequently said in connection with motions for summary judgment, a conclusory
statement on the ultimate issue does not create a genuine issue of fact. The [respondent] must put forth evidence
with respect to what activities it engaged in during the nonuse period or what outside events occurred from which
an intent to resume use during the nonuse period may reasonably be inferred.

Imperial Tobacco Ltd.. Assignee of Imperial Group PLC v. Philip Morris, Inc.899 F.2d 1575 , 1581 (Fed.Cir.1990)
(internal citations omitted). Spurlock has offered compelling evidence that Warren acted ""with intent not to resume such use""
of the Famous Monsters mark. 15 U.S.C. § 1127. In response, Plaintiffs again failed to offer any evidence that adequately
rebuts Spurlock's, other than Warren's unsupported testimony. Therefore, as ""[i]Jntent not to resume may be inferred from

circumstances,"" § 1127, this Court finds that Warren intended to not resume use of the Famous Monsters mark.

As Plaintiffs have failed to rebut Spurlock's production with sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact
on abandonment, this Court concludes that Plaintiffs have abandoned their right to the Famous Monsters mark.

6. Unfair Competition Claim on the Basis of Abandoned Mark

In their response to Spurlock's abandonment contentions, Plaintiffs contend that abandonment is not an obstacle to
their claim and rely on a district court opinion in Peter Luger, Inc. v. Silver Star Meats, Inc., 2002 WL 1870066 (W.D.Pa. May
17, 2002) (Cindrich, J.). 9 In Luger, the court considered a motion for a preliminary injunction on a dispute over brands of
deli meats. A company based primarily in western Pennsylvania (""Luger-PA"") operated a deli meats business. The company
was so successful that the public associated the Luger name with high quality products. In 1994, a nationwide deli company,
Hatfield, purchased Luger-PA, including the rights to use the Luger brand. However, only a year later, another company with
the name of Luger based out of New York (""Luger-NY"") brought a trademark infringement action against Hatfield for use of
the Luger brand. Hatfield and Luger-NY eventually settled the suit, with Hatfield agreeing to not use the Luger brand and to
instead market the deli meats under a new brand name.

Page 444

In 2001, a member of the Luger family, who used to work for Luger-PA, entered into an agreement with a third-party
deli meats distributor to sell a new brand of deli meats with the name ""R. Luger Classics."" Upon the new brand's entry into
the marketplace, there was evidence of significant confusion among customers as to whether the new R. Luger Classics
brand was owned by Hatfield, and Hatfield suffered significant losses in its own line of deli meats as a result. Hatfield
subsequently brought suit for trademark infringement and unfair competition.

On the motion for a preliminary injunction, the court considered whether Hatfield had abandoned its right to the Luger


--- Page 25 ---
mark. First, the court held that ""Hatfield did not abandon its status as the successor-in-interest to the goodwill of Luger-PA
and its well-known product line. To the contrary, Hatfield undertook reasonable efforts to transition the residual goodwill from
Luger-PA to its own brand."" 2002 WL 1870066, at *15. However, the court held in the alternative that injunctive relief was
warranted, ""even if defendants succeed on their abandonment defense, in order to prevent confusion caused by the residual
association of the Luger-PA name and trade dress with its former user, Hatfield."" /d. The court went on to identify several
cases concerning a family member's use of the surname in spite of the family company's use of the mark. In particular, the
court quoted_Gamlen Chemical Co. v. Gamlen, 79 F.Supp. 622 , 635 (W.D.Pa.1948):

A person in the employment of another individual cannot withdraw from said employment and proceed to sell the
same product, using his own surname which is similar to that of his former employer, and simulating the former
employer's labels, advertisements and trade circulars where the intent to deceive the public exists. Where such
circumstances exist, regardless of fraudulent intent, the former employee cannot use his own name.

Luger, 2002 WL 1870066, at *15. For these reasons, the court granted injunctive relief against the defendant family
member. /d.

Though certain quotes of the district court's opinion in Luger may seem to support Plaintiffs' suggestion, that use of an
abandoned mark can still be challenged, the rationale of the Luger decision is not applicable here. The Luger mark in that
case was a valuable commodity for which Hatfield paid a significant amount. Though Hatfield was forced to stop its use of
the mark, it continued to utilize the goodwill of ""Luger"" by slowly moving its customers to other brand names. Hatfield did not
totally cease its business activities and its exploitation of the market, as Warren did here. Rather, Hatfield continued using
the goodwill of the Luger mark and switching the Luger customers over to the Hatfield brand. In addition, the district court's
opinion was substantially based on the fact that the employee was part of the family that originally owned the trademark,
which is not the case with Famous Monsters. Finally, it is also important to note that the district court's conclusion on use of
an abandoned mark was made in the alternative, after concluding that it was unlikely that the defendant would succeed in
making the abandonment argument. Though there were certainly strong justifications in Luger for the district court's
holdings, those justifications do not appear in the record at hand, and the Luger holding relied on by Plaintiffs will not be
applied in this case.

As McCarthy notes at the beginning of the discussion on abandonment, ""[o]nce held abandoned, a mark falls into the
public domain and is free for all to use. While acquiescence may bar suit against one person, abandonment opens rights to

Page 445

the whole world."" McCarthy on Trademarks § 17:1; see also ITC, 482 F.3d at 147 (""Once abandoned, a mark returns to the
public domain and may, in principle, be appropriated for use by other actors in the marketplace in accordance with the basic
rules of trademark priority."" (internal citations omitted)); Consol. Home Specialties Co. v. Plotkin, 358 Pa. 14 ,55 A.2d 404 ,
412 (1947) (recognizing abandonment as defense to unfair competition claim). Plaintiffs have not offered any other caselaw
in support of their argument.

In conclusion, Spurlock's motion for summary judgment on the unfair competition claim will be granted.

V. Plaintiffs' Motion for Sanctions

Finally, in their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Plaintiffs also moved for sanctions against Spurlock for
improperly denying a request for admission that is later to be proven true, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)
(2). Plaintiffs claim that Spurlock ""had no basis under the Federal Rules to refuse admitting to the fact that the images at
issue from the Famous Monster Movie Art of Basil Gogos book were copies of the covers and commissioned paintings from
the Warren magazines.""

The Requests for Admission at issue all concerned illustrations in the Gogos Book that consisted of the Gogos artwork
without the magazine text and overlay—in essence, the original artwork. The Requests sought admissions from Spurlock
that: ""the illustration shown on the bottom portion of page [] of the softcover edition of the book Famous Monster Movie Art of
Basil Gogos is a copy of the cover of Famous Monsters of Filmland No. []."" In his responses to the requests for admission,
Spurlock carefully distinguishes between those illustrations in the Gogos book that appear with the Famous Monsters
overlay, and those images that are reproductions of Gogos' artwork without the Famous Monsters text. Regarding those
illustrations with the overlay, Spurlock admits that: ""the illustration shown ... is a reproduction of the original artwork of Basil
Gogos, originally reproduced by permission of the artist, for a single use on the cover of Famous Monsters ...."" As to those
illustrations that appear in the Gogos Book without the Famous Monsters overlay, Spurlock denies the request for
admission, stating instead: ""The work appearing on page [] of the softcover edition of the book ... is an original work of Basil
Gogos, not reproduced from Famous Monsters of Filmland No. []."" Plaintiffs claim that Spurlock's literal interpretation of the
Requests for Admission, and ""contorted responses"" were ""an attempt to thwart the very purpose of Rule 36 requests for
admissions. .. .""

Rule 36 Requests for Admission are intended ""to narrow the issues for trial to those which are genuinely contested.""
United Coal Companies v. Powell Const. Co., 839 F.2d 958 , 967 (3d Cir.1988). The Rule states that answers must respond
to the substance of the matter, specifically admitting or denying its truth. Fed. R.Civ.P. 36(a)(4). ""[W]hen good faith requires
that a party qualify an answer or deny only part of a matter, the answer must specify the part admitted and qualify or deny



--- Page 26 ---
the rest."" /d.

In light of the earlier discussion concerning ownership of the underlying Gogos artwork used for the magazine covers,
this Court will deny Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions. For purposes of copyright ownership, there is an important difference
between the illustrations in the Gogos Book that copy the magazine covers, as opposed to the illustrations that copy the
Gogos artwork that Warren used for his magazine covers. This Court can not fault Spurlock for protecting his rights by
drawing

Page 446
such a distinction in responding to the requests for admissions, and Plaintiffs' motion will therefore be denied.
VI. Motions Concerning the Experts

As this Court is granting summary judgment for Defendant on all of Plaintiffs' claims, the motions concerning the expert
opinions will be denied as moot.

ORDER

AND NOW, this 4th day of August 2009, upon consideration of Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and
Sanctions (Doc. 49), Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 51), Defendant's Motion to Preclude Denis Kitchen
(Doc. 48), Plaintiffs' Motion to Preclude Jeffrey Rovin (Doc. 50), the responses to each of these motions, the discussion at
oral argument, and in accordance with the attached Memorandun, it is hereby ORDERED that

(1) Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and for Sanctions (Doc. 49) is DENIED;
(2) Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 51) is GRANTED;

(3) Final judgment is entered in favor of Defendant on all of Plaintiffs’ counts;

(4) Defendant's Motion to Preclude Denis Kitchen (Doc. 48) is DENIED as moot;

(5) Plaintiffs’ Motion to Preclude Jeffrey Rovin (Doc. 50) is DENIED as moot; and

(6) the Clerk shall mark this case as CLOSED for statistical purposes.

Notes:
1. Saturday Review, May 7, 1887.
2. One of the ten covers was only reproduced in the first edition of the Defendant's book, as discussed in more detail below.

3. While Spurlock makes reference to six instances throughout the briefing, that was later corrected during the oral argument. (Oral Arg. 49:9-10) (""And,
Your Honor, [Plaintiffs' counsel] corrected me, and I'm wrong. Let's make it seven."").

4. While six of these instances are consistent across editions of the Gogos Book, at oral argument Plaintiffs highlighted the fact that the allegedly
infringing illustration for one of the claims, Count 19, which concerns the cover of Famous Monsters # 135 (depicting Godzilla fighting the Bionic
Monster), is different across editions. As Plaintiffs noted, ""the defendant changed the book afterwards in the second and third printings. The first printing
had a full-blown reproduction of the cover of Famous Monsters, along with the cover art that we assert belong to plaintiffs."" (Oral Arg. 48:4-8).

5. The two illustrations from the Eerie magazine that are the focus of the last two counts of copyright infringement, Eerie No. 26 and Eerie No. 30, were
not included in the general pages of the book, but were instead part of a ""bonus section that came with the deluxe slip case hard cover edition of the
book."" (PI.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4 at 117:9-13).

6. As these facts are disputed, if Plaintiffs’ ownership was determinative, trial would be necessary on the issue of ownership.

7. (Spurlock Dep. 98:13-16) (""If it's got type on it, it came from the actual printed magazine, and we, you know, took those on loan from some collector
who had it in their collection.""); (Spurlock Dep. 99:3-4) (""Q: And then what — what happened? A: They're scanned."").

8. (Spurlock Dep. 97:24-98:6) (""The answer to every original painting from that era is going to be the answer I've given you before. It's either going to be
from—if we were able to track down someone who owns the original to this day, either there or from an old transparency from Theakston.""); (Spurlock
Dep. 81:2-23) (""My understanding is that, after the bankruptcy officials sorted through the Warren offices, looking for anything that they could auction off
when Warren Publishing was forced out of business through bankruptcy, that whatever was deemed of no value was discarded into the dumpster and
that Theakston sometime later explored that dumpster and retrieved some items for his own possession."").

9. It is also important to note that the Gogos Book contains at least three additional illustrations that are copies of other Famous Monster covers, but
which Plaintiffs have not included in their Amended Complaint as the subject of copyright infringement claims. These three illustrations are copies of
Famous Monsters of Filmland covers from April 1961, No. 11, appearing at page 12 of the Gogos Book; November 1960, No. 9, appearing at page 18 of
the Gogos Book; and a reduced copy of a cover from November 1980, No. 169, appearing at page 91 of the Gogos Book (which is placed beside another
cover, from issue No. 63, that is the subject of one of the claims). Plaintiffs do not explain these omissions.

* The statement about ""more vibrant color"" may reflect age and/or consequences of copying into the Appendix filed with the Court; the magazine covers,
when they first appeared, may have been just as vibrant as Spurlock's reproductions. This term is merely descriptive and has no legal consequence.

10. In support of their argument that they own the rights to the artwork. Plaintiffs rely on 17 U.S.C. § 3 as it existed under the 1909 Copyright Act, when it
stated that ""[t]he copyright provided by this Act shall protect all the copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted, and all matter therein in which


--- Page 27 ---
copyright is already subsisting, but without extending the duration or scope of such copyright. The copyright upon composite works or periodicals shall
give to the proprietor thereof all the rights in respect thereto which he would have if each part were individually copyrighted under this Act."" Plaintiffs
argue that, by virtue of this statute, the fact that the artwork was used in the magazines, which were later copyrighted, gives them presumptive ownership
over the artwork as well. Plaintiffs have not offered any caselaw to support such an argument. And as discussed below, the relevant facts concerning this
ownership are in serious dispute.

11. ""The cover paintings that were used as part of and incorporated into the covers of the above-identified magazines and comics, were conceived and
created at the instance and expense of Publishing and were works for hire for the benefit of Publishing. These cover paintings were conceived by either
me or by someone under my direct supervision and control. Once conceived, either | or someone under my direct supervision and control offered the
assignment to Basil Gogos, a freelance artist, to produce these paintings for Publishing. | generally would meet with Mr. Gogos at Publishing's offices and
provide Mr. Gogos with specific instructions as to content and appearance of the proposed cover paintings. In this respect, | would provide Mr. Gogos
with sketches or photographs of what | wanted Mr. Gogos to render.... After approving of the cover painting—of which | had final say...."" (Warren Decl. 4
5).

12. ""There were two ways by which Mr. Gogos created covers for Famous Monsters. Either he was given a black-and-white still photograph to recreate in
color, typically illustrating an article in the magazine, which he did on his own, outside the office; or else he found an image and rendered a painting,
which he brought to the office."" (Rovin Rep. 4 41). Rovin then provides several examples of covers where Gogos selected a picture or photo that
contained flaws, which was exactly reproduced in the artwork since Warren and Rovin exerted no control over the artistic process. ( /d. ). ""Mr. Warren
never, in my experience, gave instructions to Mr. Gogos on the pallette or cropping of the original image. Only when the painting was delivered did Mr.
Warren become involved, often using a tissue overlay to indicate to the art director where he wanted the cover blurbs to go, and what color he wanted for
the lettering and the Famous Monsters logo."" (Rovin Rep. 43).

13. ""Although | am not certain of exactly when Publishing began the practice or of its exact wording, the checks provided to Mr. Gogos contained a
legend which stated that, by endorsement of the check, Mr. Gogos acknowledged payment for services rendered on a work for hire basis in connection
with the commissioned painting and confirmed that Publishing owned all right, title and interest in and to the painting (which | called ‘world rights’).""
(Warren Decl. 4 5).

14. Plaintiffs later rebut this statement with a quote from an interview with Gogos, where he stated that ""[b]ehind each check were rules about how the
covers belonged to Jim [Warren] totally! ... It was a work for hire. | signed away all these covers because | needed a job."" (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 65 at
87); (Daniel Decl. at 4 8, Ex. 1).

15. Plaintiffs rebut this statement, to a certain extent, in their brief on several grounds. (PI.'s Reply Supp. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 16 n. 51).

16. (Ken Kelly Decl., Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. B, at I 3-5); (Maelo Cintron Decl., Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. C, at 99 3-4); (Harry
Roland Decl., Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. D, at §§ 3, 5, 6); (Don Maitz Decl., Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. E. at J§ 3-4).

17. The cases sending the fair use issue to trial are remarkably few._See Ass'n of Am. Med. Colleges v. Cuomo, 928 F.2d 519 , 525-26 (2d Cir.1991)
(reversing district court's grant of summary judgment after holding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to fourth fair use factor); Byrne v. British
Broad. Corp., 132 F.Supp.2d 229 , 236 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (Stein, J.) (denying motion for summary judgment after holding that there were genuine issues of
material fact as to first fair use factor). The cases show that although a district court may of course not decide questions of fact on summary judgment,
the district judge can, if the underlying facts are not in dispute, apply those facts to the law and come to a conclusion on fair use. In other words, contrary
to many other types of cases in which issues of motive and intent may be important (e.g., employment discrimination cases, cf. Hare v. Potter, 220
Fed.Appx. 120, 129-30 (3d Cir. 2007)) (reversing grant of summary judgment where employee created genuine issue of fact as to employer's possibly
retaliatory motive in not assigning plaintiff to a special program), the court, rather than the jury, applies the facts to the governing law, at least as to the
fair use defense.

18. ""Quoting"" is effectively what Spurlock has done here, but with illustrations, rather than words.

19. This Court acknowledges the cloud that currently hangs over the vitality of the bad faith inquiry. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 585 n. 18, 114 S.Ct. 1164
(suggesting, though not directly holding, that bad faith may not be an appropriate part of the fair use analysis); Leval, supra, at 1126 (""No justification
exists for adding a morality test."").

20. Plaintiffs respond to the Greenberger affidavit by saying that he does not have the experience or expertise to make this opinion.

21. Plaintiffs argue that Kochman has no knowledge of the content of the proposed coffee table book and no knowledge of the content of the Gogos
Book.

22. As these pieces of testimony are to some extent lay opinion testimony, the Court will give them very minimal weight.

23. (Spurlock Dep. 1/28/09 148:15-24); (Spurlock Dep. 1/28/09 332:20-333:7) (stating that he is willing to publish a book concerning the Famous
Monsters magazines); (Kochman Aff. {{ 4-5) (stating that there is a market for a Famous Monsters coffee table book); (Warren Decl. 4 22, 25) (stating
that he is often asked about engaging in derivative projects).

24. Spurlock argues that this testimony is a legal conclusion and self-serving, and he contends that it should therefore be excluded from evidence.
25. As noted earlier, Kitchen is the subject of a pending motion in limine.

26. For examples of other cases in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that utilize the Lanham Act standard for Pennsylvania common law unfair
competition claims, see Strick Corp. v. Strickland. 162 F.Supp.2d 372 , 375 (E.D.Pa.2001) (Kauffman, J.) (alleging a likelihood of confusion due to
defendant's use of plaintiff's name for internet website address); Am. Fid. & Liberty Ins. Co. v. Am. Fid. Group, 2000 WL 1385899, at *13 (E.D.Pa.
Sept.25, 2000) (Yohn, J.) (alleging defendant's ""use of a mark beginning with “American Fidelity’ in connection with the sale of insurance policies
covering long term care""); Game Power Headquarters, Inc. v. Owens, 1995 WL 273663, at *3 (E.D.Pa. May 4, 1995) (Broderick, J.) (alleging defendant's
use of the phrase ""Game Power"" in renting video games at the same time the plaintiff owned the trademark to ""Game Power Headquarters"" for the use
of video game rental stores); Regal Indus., Inc. v. Genal Strap, Inc., 1994 WL 388686, at *2 (E.D.Pa. July 26, 1994) (Yohn, J.) (alleging defendant's use
of the terms SPORTSTRAP and SPORT STRAP despite the plaintiff's federally registered trademark SPORTSTRAP);_ Moore Push-Pin Co. v. Moore
Bus. Forms, Inc., 678 F.Supp. 113 , 116 (E.D.Pa.1987) (Ludwig, J.) (alleging the defendant's use of the name ""Moore"" for product marketing).

27. In Rotter, Judge Brody weighed the use of the ""passing off"" principle and the Restatement in considering the plaintiff's motion to dismiss an unfair
competition counterclaim, which alleged that the plaintiff had blocked the supply of an essential component for a product the defendant developed and
sold. 535 F.Supp.2d at 522-23 .

In Scanvec, the Third Circuit issued a non-precedential opinion discussing an unfair competition claim, which alleged that the defendants, who used


--- Page 28 ---
to own the plaintiff software company, used certain components from software owned by the plaintiff, falsified the copyright information for those
components, then utilized the plaintiff's distribution network to sell the new software. 80 Fed. Appx. at 180. Though the court decided that the issue was
not appropriately considered on appeal since the defendant did not sufficiently challenge the district court's decision, it also determined that the ""passing
off"" theory was the legal principle applicable to the claim.

In Pa. State, the Pennsylvania Superior Court considered an appeal on a common law unfair competition claim brought by Penn State University
against the defendant, University Orthopedics. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's use of the term ""University"" was sufficiently misleading to
establish liability under Pennsylvania common law. Though the Third Circuit's quotation from this case in Scanvec may suggest that an unfair
competition claim is unrelated to the Lanham Act, the Superior Court's decision indicates otherwise: ""Federal law ... serves as persuasive authority
because, for many years, it governed these areas almost exclusively and spawned a large body of federal decisions. As with federal law, the common
law of trademarks is a portion of the broader law of unfair competition."" 706 A.2d at 870 (internal citations omitted).

In Mainardi, Judge Pratter considered a defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's unfair competition claim, where the plaintiff alleged that the
defendant misled the plaintiffs into believing that they were interested in purchasing the plaintiffs’ instructional sales software, but instead developed their
own software based on the same principles and sales techniques. 2009 WL 229757, at *1-4.

28. In Babiarz, the plaintiff, who was an employee of the defendant, brought an unfair competition claim against his employer. The plaintiff alleged that
the employer created a program seeking to encourage the employees to provide new ideas and strategies for the employer. After the plaintiff provided a
new retail marketing strategy, the employer appropriated the idea without providing the plaintiff with additional compensation or recognition. In essence,
the defendant's actions were ""alleged to constitute unfair competition by appropriation of a trade secret and unlawful appropriation of an invention from its
rightful inventor, resulting in the destruction of plaintiff's patent rights."" 2001 WL 1808554, at * 10.

In Lakeview, the plaintiff was a company that provided ambulance services that sought to enter a new geographic market. Upon its attempt to enter
the market, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant ""embarked on a campaign to block expansion into the area"" by way of false statements to the public
and press, seeking to have the plaintiff's certification denied, and violating state laws and regulations. 1995 WL 842000, at *1.

29. Whether the three-year nonuse presumption of abandonment applies in this case, in which Plaintiffs claim ownership of a common law mark, is
discussed below.

30. Despite some argument by Plaintiffs on the copyright ownership issue that Harris never owned the rights to the Famous Monsters properties, see
(Part III.A.2), Plaintiffs now argue that Harris did become a successor-in-interest to the Famous Monsters mark in 1983. For case of reference and clarity,
in discussing usage of the mark from 1983 until Warren and Harris came to a settlement around 1998, it should be presumed that this Court is
considering the evidence on the record concerning Harris's use of the mark during that time period. However, the evidence offered by Spurlock indicates
that Harris also failed to use the mark, other than to register it in 1991. As discussed below, registration of the mark is not the type of activity the
Copyright Act classifies as ""use"" in commerce.

31. Spurlock disputes this assertion.

32. Plaintiffs also rely on the Restatement for the proposition that abandonment is no obstacle to their claim, but the only case cited by Plaintiffs that
accepts such an argument in considering the Lanham Act, and not the Restatement, is Luger.

OPINION AND ORDER
BRUCE J. McGIVERIN, United States Magistrate Judge.

In an amended complaint, Dennis Mario Rivera sued Méndez & Compaiiia (“Méndez”), HNK Americas, Luis Alvarez,
Triple-S Propiedad, Inc. and others, alleging copyright infringement. Docket No. 83 (“Compl.”). The parties have consented
to proceed before a magistrate judge. Docket No. 107. Before the court is plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and
defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment. Docket Nos. 120, 121 (“PI. Mot.”), 124 (“Def. Mot”), 125. Each side has
opposed the other, and plaintiff additionally

[988 F.Supp.2d 164]

submitted a reply. Docket Nos. 128, 132, 148. In light of the findings of fact and legal discussion set forth below, plaintiff's
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and defendants' motion for partial summary
judgment is DENIED.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate when “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and
the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A fact is material only if it “might affect the
outcome of the suit under the governing law,” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 , 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91
L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) , and “[a] ‘genuine’ issue is one that could be resolved in favor of either party.""Calero—Cerezo v. U.S.
Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6 , 19 (1st Cir.2004). The court does not weigh facts, but instead ascertains whether the “evidence
is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Leary v. Dalton, 58 F.3d 748 , 751 (1st
Cir.1995).

The movant must first “inform[ ] the district court of the basis for its motion,” and identify the record materials “which it
believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”_Celotex Corp. v. Catrett_477 U.S. 317 , 323, 106
S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) ; R. 56(c)(1). If this threshold is met, the opponent “must do more than simply show that
there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts” to avoid summary judgment._Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith
Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 , 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348 , 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) . The nonmoving party may not prevail with mere
“conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation” for any element of the claim. Medina—Mufioz
v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5 , 8 (1st Cir.1990). Still, the court draws inferences and evaluates facts “in the light
most favorable to the nonmoving party,” Leary, 58 F.3d at 751 , and the court must not “superimpose [its] own ideas of
probability and likelihood (no matter how reasonable those ideas may be) upon the facts of the record.” Greenburg v. P.R.
Maritime Shipping Auth., 835 F.2d 932 , 936 (1st Cir.1987).

BACKGROUND

This summary of the facts is guided by the parties' Local Rule 56 statements of uncontested facts. See Docket Nos.
120 (“Pl. SUF”), 125 (“Def. SUF”), 131, 133, 149.4

Dennis Mario Rivera is an artist of more than 30 years based in Puerto Rico. Méndez & Compaiia is a Puerto Rico
company that serves as the exclusive distributor of Heineken beer in Puerto Rico, and sponsors the annual Puerto Rico
Heineken Jazz Fest (“PRHUJF”). Luis Alvarez is a Vice President at Méndez and the Executive Producer of PRHJF. Pl. SUF
qf 1-5. The Puerto Rico Heineken Jazz Fest is a music festival, established in 1991, and which raises funds for students of


--- Page 2 ---
the Berklee College of Music. Def. SUF 4 1.
[988 F.Supp.2d 165]

Sometime before the 1998 festival, Méndez approached Rivera and commissioned him to create a visual design that
included the Heineken logo and featured that year's artist, to be used in various promotional and marketing materials
(posters, t-shirts, bus shelters, etc.) for the 1998 PRHJF. Compl. 9 16-17; Def. SUF § 2-3. For each festival starting in
1998 through 2009, Rivera created one such design (for a total of twelve pieces). Pl. SUF § 10. Rivera was given a
significant amount of artistic freedom to create these works. /d. { 100-02, 104. Upon completion of each piece, Rivera
would deliver to Méndez the original work, framed, and the work in a digital format on a disk. Def. SUF § 7. For each piece,
he charged Méndez $5000 for the original artwork, $4000 for “logo design,” and an additional sum for the original's framing.
See, e.g., Docket No. 125-8, at 10-18. Prior to the festival's twentieth anniversary in 2010, Alvarez met with Rivera at a
restaurant in San Juan and notified him that another artist would be designing the artwork for the 2010 PRHUJF. PI. SUF {if
11-12. During this meeting, Rivera claims he told Alvarez that he was fine with this change, but that they could no longer
use any of his prior artwork. /d. ¢ 165; Docket No. 146-9. Alvarez claims Rivera never made such a statement. Docket No.
133-1, at 2.

Although Méndez did not commission Rivera to produce a new piece for the 2010 festival, Méndez used at least six of
Rivera's previous designs in a collage that was placed on festival programs and commemorative merchandise sold during
the 2010 festival. Pl. SUF 4 116; Def. SUF § 10. Rivera did not explicitly authorize the creation of this collage. Pl. SUF 4
118. Additionally, Rivera's artworks are still displayed on the Méndez & Compafia (www. mendezcopr. com) and PRHJF
websites (www. prheinekenjazz. com). PI. SUF 4 17; Docket Nos. 133-3, 133-4. On the Méndez website, a page describes
the history of the Heineken Jazz Fest and allows the user to scroll through year-by-year, to see the artwork from each
annual event, including all twelve of Rivera's works. Docket No. 133, Additional Fact { 7.

Rivera registered all twelve artworks at issue with the U.S. Copyright Office on April 27, 2011. Docket No. 120-4. He
brought suit against defendants in June 2011 for copyright infringement, seeking injunctive relief and damages.

DISCUSSION

Plaintiff Rivera moves for summary judgment on his copyright infringement claim. To prevail, a plaintiff must
demonstrate an absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to: 1) ownership of copyright, and 2) defendants’
infringement._Johnson v. Gordon, 409 F.3d 12 , 17 (1st Cir.2005) (“two elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid
copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original”). Defendant Méndez argues that its use of
Rivera's artwork is within the scope of implied licenses Rivera granted to Méndez each time an artwork was commissioned
and delivered. Méndez also asserts a fair use defense with respect to the display of Rivera's artwork on the Méndez &
Compafia and PRHJF websites. Lastly, Méndez moves for partial summary judgment on Rivera's claim for damages. Each
issue will be discussed below in turn.

|. Copyright Infringement

To establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must first demonstrate ownership of a valid copyright. Johnson, 409 F.3d

at 17 ; see also Feist Publ'ns. Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) .
The burden of proving copyright ownership

[988 F.Supp.2d 166]

is borne by the plaintiff. Grubb v. KMS Patriots, L.P., 88 F.3d 1 , 3, 5 (1st Cir.1996). Registration with the U.S. Copyright
Office within five years of the work's first publication is prima facie evidence of copyright ownership, and the burden shifts to
the opposing party to demonstrate invalidity of the copyright. 17 U.S.C. § 410(c);_ Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 49
F.3d 807 , 813 (1st Cir.1995). Registration obtained after five years benefits from no presumption, and the weight given to

such a registration is within the discretion of the court. 17 U.S.C. § 410(c); Brown v. Latin Am. Music Co.. Inc., 498 F.3d 18 ,
23-24 (1st Cir.2007).

In this case, Rivera registered all twelve artworks at issue on April 27, 2011. See Docket No. 120-4. The first
publication date for these pieces range from 1998 to 2009. /d. Thus, the registrations are prima facie evidence of valid
copyright ownership for only some of the artworks (those with a first publication date on or after April 27, 2006). However,
Méndez has produced no evidence to demonstrate why Rivera's claimed copyright is not valid, and in fact it admits that
Rivera is the “copyright owner of the artworks” at issue. SUF § 9. Accordingly, | find that Rivera has established ownership
of valid copyright and has satisfied the first prong of his copyright infringement claim. Summary judgment as to the issue of
copyright ownership is granted. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(g) (court may enter order finding any material fact not in dispute and
“treating the fact as established in the case”)

With respect to the second prong, a plaintiff must show “(a) that the defendant actually copied the work as a factual
matter,” and “(b) that the defendant's copying of the copyrighted material was so extensive that it rendered the infringing and
copyrighted works ‘substantially similar.’ ” Airframe Sys., Inc. v. L-3 Comms. Corp., 658 F.3d 100 , 105-06 (1st Cir.2011)
(quoting_Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. ASP Consulting LLC, 560 F.3d 53 , 58 (1st Cir.2009)) (further citations omitted). Absent
direct evidence of copying, actual copying may be inferred where “the alleged infringer had access to the copyrighted work”



--- Page 3 ---
and “the offending and copyrighted works are so similar that the court may infer that there was factual copying (i-e.,
probative similarity).” Lotus Dev. Corp., 49 F.3d at 813 . The probative similarity inquiry “is somewhat akin to, but different
han, the requirement of substantial similarity.” Johnson, 409 F.3d at 18 . Substantial similarity exists where “a reasonable,
ordinary observer, upon examination of the two works, would ‘conclude that the defendant unlawfully appropriated the
plaintiff's protectable expression.’ ” T— Peg, Inc. v. Vt. Timber Works, Inc.,459 F.3d 97 , 112 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting
Johnson, 409 F.3d at 18 ). “Summary judgment on substantial similarity is ‘unusual’ but can be warranted on the right set of
acts.” T—Peg, 459 F.3d at 112.

Rivera appears to claim at least two distinct sets of infringing activity: (1) use and display of his artwork in a collage
hat commemorates the twentieth anniversary of PRHJF, and (2) display of his artwork on the Méndez & Compafia and
PRHJF websites. In both instances, there is compelling evidence of copying in-fact. It is undisputed that Méndez had access
0 Rivera's artwork—in the form of the original, and in digital form. Def. SUF § 7. Méndez also admits to use and
reproduction of Rivera's prior artwork to create the 2010 anniversary collage. Pl. SUF 4 116; Def. SUF 4 10. And the
websites clearly reproduce and display substantial portions of the artworks at issue, such that they could not be reproduced

[988 F.Supp.2d 167]
without copying-in-fact. See, e.g., Docket Nos. 133-3, 133-4.

However, Rivera falls short in establishing substantial similarity between the copyrighted works and the infringing
works, as he appears to conflate the concepts of probative similarity with substantial similarity. After noting defendants'
access to his works and the “striking similarity” between the copyrighted works and the infringing works, Rivera asserts ina
conclusory fashion that the substantial similarity inquiry is satisfied. Pl. Mot. at 15-16. Plaintiff does not provide details on
how much of the artworks were copied and used in the allegedly infringing collage or the website. “It is not enough merely to
mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the
argument, and put flesh on its bones.” United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1990) . Given this lack of argumentation,
it cannot be said that a reasonable jury must find that the defendants unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff's protectable
expression. | find that Rivera has not met his burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact with
respect to substantial similarity. Thus, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to infringement must be denied.

Il. Implied License

Even assuming ownership of copyright and infringement, Méndez argues it is not liable because Rivera granted it an
irrevocable, implied license to use, reproduce, and display the works.

Federal copyright law provides that a transfer of copyright ownership must generally be in writing and signed by the
copyright owner. 17 U.S.C. § 204(a); see Latin Am. Music Co. v. Archdiocese, 499 F.3d 32 , 42 (1st Cir.2007). However, this
requirement does not apply to the grant of nonexclusive licenses. See 17 U.S.C. § 101; see also John G. Danielson, Inc. v.

Winchester—Conant Props., Inc., 322 F.3d 26 , 40 (1st Cir.2003). The owner of a copyright may grant such nonexclusive
licenses orally, or such licenses may be implied from conduct indicating the owner's intent to allow a licensee to use the

work. /d. “Uses of a copyrighted work that stay within the bounds of an implied license do not infringe the copyright.” Estate
of Hevia v. Portrio Corp., 602 F.3d 34 , 41 (1st Cir.2010). The burden of proving the existence of such a license is on the
licensee party claiming its protection. /d. Moreover, “implied licenses are found only in narrow circumstances.” /d.

“The touchstone for finding an implied license is intent.” /d. (internal quotations omitted). The ultimate inquiry is
“whether the totality of the parties' conduct indicates an intent to grant such permission.” /d. (internal quotations omitted). In
determining whether an implied license was granted, courts look to various factors, including: (1) “whether the licensee
requested the work,” (2) “whether the creator made and delivered that work,” and (3) “whether the creator intended that the
licensee would copy and make use of the work.” /d.

In this case, the evidence clearly indicates Rivera granted Méndez an implied license to use, reproduce, and display
his artworks. It is undisputed that Méndez, the licensee, requested Rivera to create the twelve artworks at issue. Compl.
16-17. Accordingly, Rivera created and delivered the artworks to Méndez, with the intent that Méndez would “reproduce,
display, and distribute copies” of the works in marketing materials to promote each annual PRHJF Compl. { 18.

The real dispute centers on the scope of the implied license—namely, its
[988 F.Supp.2d 168]

duration and extent. Rivera claims he granted Méndez limited one-year licenses for each of the artworks, such that the
licenses expired at the end of each annual PRHJF; and thus when Méndez used and reproduced Rivera's artwork at the
2010 PRH4JF, it was infringing on his exclusive rights under federal copyright laws. Docket No. 148, at 9-10. In response,
Méndez argues that the implied license was of indefinite duration and irrevocable. Docket No. 132, at 2.

Determining the scope of an implied license is an objective inquiry. Danielson, 322 F.3d at 42 . The focus is not on the
parties' subjective intent but their objective manifestation of it. /d. On the record before me, there exists a genuine issue of
material fact as to whether the parties intended for the implied license to be of a limited or indefinite duration. The record
lacks evidence of statements or conduct that indicate whether Rivera intended for Méndez to be able to use his artwork


--- Page 4 ---
beyond the year in which it was commissioned. It is also unclear whether Méndez objectively manifested an intent to procure
rom Rivera a license to use the artworks for more than the year in which they were made. The record so far only
establishes that for each year starting 1998 through 2009, Méndez commissioned Rivera to create one artwork representing
hat year's festival. 2Both parties were aware and intended that the artwork be used to promote the event that year. Beyond
his base of agreement, it is difficult to say whether the parties had any other intended uses for the artworks.

Méndez notes that Rivera was aware that the artwork would be used to brand each event, and the artwork would be
used on PRHJF merchandise such as posters, t-shirts, coasters, CDs, that by their nature would be available for sale after
he event (at least until the merchandise sold out). It is true that such awareness would tend to show Rivera knew his
artwork from prior years would still be available in the form of merchandise past the immediate festival. But this awareness
does not necessarily mean Rivera intended to allow Méndez to use the artworks indefinitely and create collages therefrom
or future events. Thus, there is a genuine issue of material fact which precludes summary judgment on this defense.

In a last ditch effort, Rivera contends that any implied license granted to Méndez was revoked upon the filing of this
action. Docket No. 148, at 10. Méndez counters that the implied licenses at issue here are supported by consideration, and
hus are irrevocable. 3 Docket No. 132, at 6. Rivera's claim that any implied license granted was terminated upon the filing of
an infringement suit has been squarely rejected by other circuit courts. See, e.g.,

[988 F.Supp.2d 169]

Lulirama Ltd. v. Axcess Broad. Servs., Inc., 128 F.3d 872 , 882 (5th Cir.1997). Those same courts have held that implied
licenses supported by consideration are irrevocable. See Asset Mktg. Sys., Inc. v. Gagnon, 542 F.3d 748 , 757 (9th

Cir.2008); Lulirama,128 F.3d at 882 (“[A] nonexclusive license supported by consideration is a contract’). In any event, a
genuine question remains as to whether Méndez exceeded the scope of the implied license, and whether its conduct
amounted to infringement of Rivera's exclusive rights.

lll. Fair Use Defense

Méndez also seeks a determination that its displays of Rivera's artwork on Méndez & Compania and PRHJF's websites
constitute fair use. Docket No. 132, at 10.

“Fair use” is a defense that allows a court to avoid the rigid application of the Copyright Act when such application
would stifle the very creativity the law was designed to foster. See Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207 , 236,110 S.Ct. 1750 ,
109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) . The “fair use” defense permits the use of copyrighted materials for certain purposes, including
parody, criticism, comment, teaching, news reporting, or research. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 576—
77, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) .

Section 107 of the Copyright Act provides a list of non-exclusive factors that a court must ponder in determining
whether an unauthorized use of a copyrighted work can be called “fair use,” including “(1) the purpose and character of the
use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit, educational purposes; (2) the nature of the
copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of its use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.” 17 U.S.C. § 107; see Stewart, 495
U.S. at 236 -37, 110 S.Ct. 1750 ; Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539 , 549 & 561,105 S.Ct.
2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . No one factor is dispositive; all are to be explored and weighed together in light of the
purposes of the Copyright Act. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Since fair use is an affirmative defense,
defendants carry the burden of proof in demonstrating fair use. /d. at 590, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Although fair use is a mixed
question of law and fact, a district court may resolve fair use issues on summary judgment where there is no genuine issue
of material fact relevant to the fair use determination. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 560 -61, 105 S.Ct. 2218 .

A. Purpose and Character of Use

The first factor focuses upon whether the new work “merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead
adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or
message; it asks, in other words, whether and to what extent the new work is ‘transformative.’ ” Campbell,510 U.S. at 579 ,
114 S.Ct. 1164 . Other factors that may militate against a fair use finding decline in significance to the extent that a work is

more transformative. /d.

Here the use is somewhat transformative. The purpose of the new use, in defendant's words, is “expository, archival” in
nature. The display of Rivera's works on the two websites is meant to be informational. The artworks appear on both
websites on pages that describe the history of the Heineken Jazz Fest. For example, on the Méndez website, one page
describes the history of the festival and allows the user to scroll through year-by-year to see the artwork from each annual
PRHJF,

[988 F.Supp.2d 170]

including all of Rivera's works. See, e.g., Docket No. 133-4. But this new use does not add anything to the works such that it

creates a wholly “new expression, meaning, or message.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The websites do not
alter the artworks in any significant way, except to resize them so that they fit on the webpage. Moreover, the artworks were



--- Page 5 ---
originally created to promote and represent that year's festival, and the reproduction of these works on the website also
serve as a representation of these past events. Thus, | find Méndez's new use only slightly transformative. Cf. Robinson v.
Random House, Inc., 877 F.Supp. 830 , 841 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (finding new biographical use was not substantially

transformative because when “the secondary use involves ... an untransformed duplication of the original, it has little or no
value that does not exist in the original work’).

The fact that a use is commercial as opposed to nonprofit is a separate factor that tends to weigh against a fair use
finding. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . “[E]very commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively
an unfair exploitation” of a copyright owner's monopoly privilege. /d. “The crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether
the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from the exploitation of the copyrighted
material without paying the customary price.” /d. (citations omitted). The court also considers the propriety of defendants’
conduct as part of the “character” of the use. Fair use presupposes good faith and fair dealing. /d. at 562-63, 105 S.Ct. 2218

The distinction between commercial versus nonprofit use is of limited importance here, but it could be said to weigh
slightly against a finding of fair use. Although PRHJF is an event intended to raise funds for students of the Berklee College
of Music, the event sponsor, Méndez, is a corporation that stands to commercially benefit from use of Rivera's works to
promote the jazz festival series and the Heineken brand itself. Additionally, there is no evidence of bad faith on the part of
Méndez in using Rivera's works on the two websites. On balance, then, | find that there is a genuine issue as to whether the
purpose and character of the use weighs in favor of or against a fair use finding.

B. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The next factor “calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than
others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied.” Campbell,_510
U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Creative works of art are traditionally at the core of intended copyright protection, though the
scope for fair use of published works is broader than that for unpublished works._Reyes v. Wyeth Pharm., Inc., 603
F.Supp.2d 289 , 298 (D.P.R.2009) (citing Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605 , 612 (2d Cir.2006)).
However, the factor may be of limited usefulness where the creative work of art is being used for a transformative purpose.
See Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 612 ; Campbell,_510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 .

Here, the works at issue are creative works deserving of protection. Although the works contain some informative
elements, namely, references to the Heineken brand and the artist or artists performing that year, the works themselves are
completely original creations by Rivera. He enjoyed a great deal of artistic freedom (in color, design, and medium) when
creating these works. PI. SUF { 100-02, 104. Given that the secondary use is only slightly

[988 F.Supp.2d 171]
transformative, this factor clearly weighs against a finding of fair use.
C. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

The third factor focuses on whether the quantity and value of the materials used are reasonable in relation to the
purpose of the copying. Campbell,510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citation and quotation omitted). Copying an entire work
usually weighs against a fair use finding, but courts have also found that copying the entirety of a work is sometimes
necessary to make a fair use of it. Reyes, 603 F.Supp.2d at 299 (citations omitted); Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 613 .
However, copying only an insubstantial portion of the entire work “in absolute terms” may not help the defendant if that
portion constitutes the “heart” of the work. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564 -65, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (relatively few words quoted
from unpublished manuscript, but passages used were among the most interesting and powerful in the book). Thus the
inquiry at the third factor must take into account that “the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and
character of the use.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 -87, 114 S.Ct. 1164 .

This factor is relatively neutral in the instant analysis. Méndez appears to concede that entire works or substantial
portions of the artworks appear on the two websites. Docket No. 132, at 13. But the displays of entire works or substantial
portions thereof appear to be necessary to effectuate the purpose of the secondary use, i.e. to memorialize and inform the
reader of the past festivals. The websites would not be as informative of PRHUJF history if they displayed only insignificant
portions of the artworks. Thus, this factor does not weigh against a finding of fair use.

D. Effect of the Use upon the Potential Market for the Works

Lastly, the court must evaluate “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.”
17 U.S.C. § 107. This factor “requires courts to consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions
of the alleged infringer[s], but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant
would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original.” Campbell,_510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct.
1164 (punctuation and citation omitted). This factor “must take account not only of harm to the original but also of harm to
the market for derivative works.” /d. (quoting Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 568 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ). That is, this factor focuses
upon secondary uses of the copyrighted work that, “by offering a substitute for the original, usurp a market that properly
belongs to the copyright holder.” Reyes, 603 F.Supp.2d at 299 (citation and quotation omitted). However, “a copyright holder



--- Page 6 ---
cannot prevent others from entering fair use markets merely by developing or licensing a market for ... transformative uses
of its own creative work.” Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 614 —15 (citation and quotation omitted). “[C]opyright owners
may not preempt exploitation of transformative markets.” /d. (citation and quotation omitted). When “the second use is

transformative, market substitution is at least less certain, and market harm may not be so readily inferred.” Campbell, 510
U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164.

Méndez contends that display of Rivera's works on its websites do not negatively affect the potential market for the
works as there is no market for these works. It is true that Méndez owns the originals, but that does not mean there is

[988 F.Supp.2d 172]

no market for Rivera's twelve works. The originals could be sold in the future to other buyers, and there certainly may be a
market for derivative works. Because fair use is an affirmative defense, the burden is on defendants to demonstrate fair use,
but it is difficult to carry this burden “without favorable evidence about relevant markets.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 . Defendants have introduced no such evidence except to assert that their use does not affect the market for
plaintiffs works. Such bald assertions are not evidence. Thus, defendants have not carried their burden of proof on this
factor.

In light of the foregoing, | find defendants have failed to establish the absence of genuine issues of material fact
compelling a finding of fair use. However, defendants may present evidence in support of a fair use defense at trial.

IV. Summary Judgment as to Damages

Méndez also moves for partial summary judgment on the issue of damages. Méndez argues that Rivera's claim for
damages should be dismissed as he has no evidence of actual damages and is ineligible to elect statutory damages. Def.
Mot. 3. Rivera points to his experts’ reports as evidence of actual damages.

Section 504(b) of the Copyright Act provides that a prevailing plaintiff in an infringement suit may recover either (1)
actual damages suffered by the copyright owner and any additional profits of the infringer attributable to the infringement, or
(2) statutory damages pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c). Because Rivera failed to timely register his works, he is not entitled to
seek statutory damages. See 17 U.S.C. § 412(2) (statutory damages are unavailable where infringement occurs after first
publication and before the effective date of registration). Rivera also does not appear to seek recovery based on Méndez's
profits attributable to the infringement. See Docket No. 128, at 16. Therefore, to survive summary judgment, Rivera must
offer some proof of actual damages. Actual damages consist of “all income and profits lost as a consequence of the
infringement,” Bruce v. Weekly World News, Inc., 310 F.3d 25 , 28 (1st Cir.2002), and is generally measured by the amount
that would have accrued to plaintiff but for the defendant's infringement, see Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support
Corp., 36 F.3d 1147 , 1171 (1st Cir.1994), abrogated on other grounds by Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154 ,
130 S.Ct. 1237 , 176 L.Ed.2d 18 (2010) .

In a situation where the plaintiff's losses are hard to quantify, and the infringer has not directly profited from the
infringement, courts look to the value of the infringing use (i.e. a hypothetical licensing fee) to determine damages. See,
e.g., Davis v. The Gap, Inc., 246 F.3d 152 , 160-61, 172 (2d Cir.2001). The ultimate question is what a willing licensee
would have been reasonably required to pay to a willing copyright licensor. Real View, LLC. v. 20-20 Techs., Inc.,811
F.Supp.2d 553 , 557 (D.Mass.2011). However, the fact that “the fair market value of a reasonable license fee may involve
some uncertainty ... is not sufficient reason to refuse to consider this as an eligible measure of actual damages.” Davis, 246
F.3d at 166 . Additionally, uncertainty should not preclude recovery, if the uncertainty is as to amount, not as to the fact that
actual damages are attributable to the infringement. Real View,811 F.Supp.2d at 558 (internal quotations and alterations
omitted). At bottom, the “amount of damages must not be speculative and must be grounded in objective evidence of what a
buyer would reasonably have been charged

[988 F.Supp.2d 173]

for the particular use at issue.” /d. (internal quotations omitted).

Méndez, in its motion for partial summary judgment and an accompanying motion to strike (Docket No. 123), argues
that Rivera's experts should be stricken under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Specifically, Méndez contends
that neither expert is qualified and their opinions are based on flawed methodologies that are irrelevant to the issue of actual
damages. | need not reach a decision on that issue to resolve defendants' motion for partial summary judgment. Although
Rivera's method for computation of a hypothetical licensing fee may be problematic, a wholesale rejection of Rivera's claim
for damages is inappropriate at this time. Even assuming Rivera's expert testimony is inadmissible, Rivera still has some
evidence of actual damages. At the very least, the invoices from 1998 through 2009 suggest that the fair market value to
use his artwork is a minimum of $4000. The fact that the amount of a reasonable license fee is uncertain should not
preclude recovery. The issue here is the amount of actual damages, not whether there is evidence of actual damages.
Davis, 246 F.3d at 166 . The situation at bar is distinguished from /conbazaar, L.L.C. v. Am. Online, Inc., where the court
granted defendant's motion for summary judgment, because in that case, the plaintiff failed to offer any evidence to “quantify
any license fee it thinks it might be due.” 378 F.Supp.2d 592 , 594 (M.D.N.C.2005). Without any evidence, Iconbazaar
offered “nothing more than mere speculation” as to the licensing fees it might be due. 378 F.Supp.2d 592 , 595
(M.D.N.C.2005).



--- Page 7 ---
Similarly, the Fourth Circuit's recent decision in Dash v. Mayweather, wherein the court affirmed the district court's
grant of summary judgment for defendants, provides no relief for Méndez. 731 F.3d 303 (4th Cir.2013) . There, the court
noted that the plaintiff, Dash, “failed to present any evidence—such as an affidavit or a prior contract—that he had ever sold,
offered for sale, or licensed one of his beats” to defendants or anyone else. /d. at 317. Dash's only evidence to support his
damages claim was an expert report that failed to clearly state the work had a fair market value. /d. From this, the court
concluded that the expert's “omission of a clear statement of value suggests that he could not conclude, either with certainty
or sound reasoning,” that plaintiff would have been paid a licensing fee for use of his work. /d. The Fourth Circuit further
noted that “evidence of a copyright holder's prior licensing or valuation of his work can provide sufficient support for his
actual damages claim,” id., which is the precise situation the court is confronted with in this case. Here, the invoices between
Rivera and Méndez are evidence of the copyright holder's prior licensing and valuation of his work. Rivera clearly has some
evidence to support his actual damages claim.

In light of the above, Méndez's motion for partial summary judgment must be denied.
CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED on the issue of copyright ownership
and DENIED as to infringement, and defendants' motion for partial summary judgment is DENIED.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

Notes:

Local Rule 56 requires parties at summary judgment to supply brief, numbered statements of facts, supported by
citations to admissible evidence. It “relieve[s] the district court of any responsibility to ferret through the record to discern
whether any material fact is genuinely in dispute,” CM/ Capital Market Inv. v. Gonzdlez—Toro, 520 F.3d 58 , 62 (1st
Cir.2008), and prevents litigants from “shift[ing] the burden of organizing the evidence presented in a given case to the
district court.” Mariani-Colon v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 511 F.3d 216 , 219 (1st Cir.2007). The rule “permits the district
court to treat the moving party's statement of facts as uncontested” when not properly opposed, and litigants ignore it “at
their peril.” /d.

2.Méndez points out that it commissioned Rivera to create two works in 1999, because the musician originally
scheduled (Chucho Valdes) was unable to attend. Docket No. 133, Additional Facts 4/2. The Chucho Valdes work was used

in a subsequent year. /d. § 4. This slight twist does not affect the court's calculus because it does not shed light on the
parties’ intent at the time of contracting for these works.

3.Méndez also asserts that termination of transfers of copyright must be made in writing pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 203.
But that provision is inapplicable here as Rivera is not seeking to exercise his right of termination under § 203, but rather
appears to be asserting an argument for termination under contract principles. See Korman v. HBC Florida, Inc., 182 F.3d
1291 , 1297 (11th Cir.1999) (noting that § 203 is not meant to convert casual oral licenses into thirty-five year “straitjacket
[s]’ and “if state law provides that licenses of indefinite duration may be terminated in less than 35 years, it is state law and
not section 203 that governs the question of termination’).

ORDER ON THE PARTIES’ MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

RODNEY SMITH, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
[510 F.Supp.3d 1275]

Plaintiff, Apple Inc. (""Apple"") designs and manufactures mobile communication devices, personal computers, and media
devices, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, and third-party digital content and applications. iOS is
Apple's mobile operating system (or ""OS"") for certain devices like the iPhone. iOS is publicly available online for free
download from Apple's servers as part of a packaged file. Around 2016 or 2017, Apple removed encryption from the kernel,
which is the core of the operating system that has complete control over all system resources.

In 2017, Defendant, Corellium, LLC (""Corellium"") began developing a commercial product (""the Corellium Product"") that
permits users to create tailored, virtual models of iPhones, using iOS files loaded by the user. (The Corellium Product also
virtualizes Android, the mobile operating system used by Google, but the Android aspects of the Corellium Product are not
issue in this case.) With its relatively limited functionality, among other things, the Corellium Product does not virtualize the
Apple App Store, and users cannot make phone calls or use camera—features of interest to the average customer buying
an iPhone off the shelf. According to testimony of developers of the Corellium Product, the product is intended to provide an
environment in which technology security researchers can conduct research with features of interest to those researchers.
Still, there is no evidence that the Corellium Product, like other technology, cannot be used for unintended purposes, or that
Corellium can control how users utilize any Corellium Product installed on their premises.

Starting in January 2018, Apple and Corellium began engaging in acquisition talks which, if successful, would have allowed
Apple to acquire Corellium (including its people and the Corellium Product). During the acquisition process, there were
several in-person meetings and calls between the companies. The Corellium Product was demonstrated (""demo'ed"") to
Apple and there was technical due diligence. In the summer of 2018, the potential deal fell apart and Apple did not acquire
Corellium.

On August 15, 2019, Apple filed this lawsuit alleging that Corellium infringed Apple's copyrights in iOS and circumvented its
security measures in violation of the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act (""DMCA""). Corellium denies

[510 F.Supp.3d 1276]

that it has violated the DMCA or Apple's copyrights. Corellium further argues that even if it used Apple's copyrighted work,
such use constitutes ""fair use"" and, therefore, is legally permissible. Apple filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [DE
470] and Corellium filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 464]. For the reasons explained below, on the copyright claim,
the Court finds that Corellium's use of iOS constitutes fair use, and a genuine dispute of material facts precludes summary
judgment on the DMCA claim. Thus, Corellium's motion is granted in part and denied in part, and Apple's motion is denied. +

BACKGROUND
A. iOS: APPLE'S OPERATING SYSTEM

An operating system is a program that manages the resources of the computer, allocating those resources to other


--- Page 2 ---
programs as needed. It manages the computer's most basic functions, including the user's interaction with the device. iOS is
Apple's operating system for its iPhone, iPod Touch, and until September 25, 2019, iPad. (Andrews Decl. [DE 470-4] 4.)
The iPhone was introduced in 2007. It is one of the world's first ""smartphones"" and remains one of the most popular
consumer electronic devices in the world. (Andrews Decl. 4 3.) For the iPhone, among other things, the ability to make
phone calls, send text messages, take photos, and download apps from Apple's App Store are important features of iOS.
(Def.’s SOF [DE 472] 3.)

iOS does not include hardware or some components of the secure boot chain (discussed below), like Boot ROM, which are
built directly into the physical device. (Def.’s SOF 4 4.) However, iOS encompasses default software applications, underlying
graphics, images, and files that help create the iOS displays, and graphical user interface (""GUI"") elements installed on
Apple's mobile devices. (Andrews Decl. § 6.) Generally, GUI is a visual way of interacting with a computer using items such
as icons and menus. 2iOS also encompasses the source code and object code representing the processes managing the
execution of applications and utilization of device resources. 2(Andrews Decl. { 6.)

iOS includes open and partially open source code; it includes code that was not
[510 F.Supp.3d 1277]

written by Apple. (Marineau-Mes Dep. [DE 472-4] 37:6-14.) This includes: (1) open source code that Apple uses under
license (e.g., Secure Socket Layer); (2) components for which Apple is the primary owner (e.g., WebKit); and (3) aspects
where Apple contributes some of the code (e.g., the kernel). (Andrews Dep. [DE 472-3] 91:22-93:13, 100:20-23; Marineau-
Mes Dep. 37:6-40:11 (other open source components of iOS are the compiler and Swift).) Likewise, iOS’ Darwin, which is
part of the kernel, stems from research dating back thirty to forty years—long before Apple developed the iPhone.
(Marineau-Mes Dep. 37:6-40:6.) For these open source components, Apple is key contributor to the code bases and, in
many cases, invented the code and chose to make it available in open source. (Marineau-Mes Dep. 39:23-40:7.)

B. IPSW FILES

Apple continuously releases new versions of iOS. It also releases at least some components of iOS in software files known
as ""IPSW"" files. (Andrews Dep. 94:13-25; Krstic Dep. [DE 472-1] 126:13-127:21; Wang Dep. [DE 472-6] 59:24-61:10.) IPSW
files are available online for free download from Apple's servers, including via links provided on third-party sites like ipsw.me.
(Def.’s SOF 4 6.) A user is not presented with or required to agree to the iOS Software License Agreement or End User
License Agreement (""EULA"") before downloading an IPSW file. (Def.’s SOF 4 12; Andrews Dep. 95:13-15, 98:14-20.)

IPSW files have iOS without some of the runtime elements such as the cryptographic authorization ticket, which authorizes a
given version of iOS to run in a given piece of hardware. (Krstic Dep. 126:13-127:21.) Further, many parts of the IPSW files
are unencrypted, including the kernel, which is the core of the operating system that has complete control over all system
resources. (Def.’s SOF § 8.) Thus, once downloaded, a person can read some of the file contents, and it is possible to
access contents of the kernel, as well as extract other parts of the file. (Krstic Dep. 67:12-21, 129:21-130:4; Marineau-Mes
Dep. 57:2-10.) The kernel can run on non-Apple devices, but protections put in place by Apple—which intends for the kernel
to run on Apple devices—makes it difficult to do so. (Krstic Dep. 130:23-132:13, 141-143:3.) The IPSW files also contain
image files such as wallpaper. (Def.’s SOF 7.)

C. APPLE'S TECHNICAL CONTROL MEASURES

Apple designs iOS and devices running iOS as an integrated hardware/software system. (Pl.’s SOF [DE 470-2] § 10.) Apple
does not provide the functionality to ""clone"" or copy the complete contents of an iPhone. ( /d. 4 11.) Combining hardware,
software, and service features, Apple has put security measures in place to protect its devices and customers’ experience.
(PI.’s Resp. to Second Interr. No. 16 [DE 553-9]. 4) In its motion, Apple focuses on the following measures:

[510 F.Supp.3d 1278]

Authorization Server : According to Apple, upon installing iOS on an Apple device (e.g., iPhone), the device must first
communicate with Apple's ""authorization server"" for approval. The device sends information to Apple about the physical
iPhone and the version of iOS the user seeks to install. The authorization server checks this information, and if the
information presented checks out, returns a cryptographic signature (known as an ""AP Ticket"") authorizing installation on the
device. The signed AP Ticket is saved to the device and is required to be checked every time the device tries to run iOS.
(PI.’s SOF 9 14-15.) Corellium disagrees with this statement, asserting instead that ""iOS in the public IPSW distribution ...
has no such requirements—this security function is hard-coded into physical iOS devices."" (Def.’s Resp. SOF [DE 513] 9
14-15.)

Secure boot chain: Secure boot chain is a way Apple prevents unauthorized code from running on its systems. The process
involves an interaction between iOS and software embedded in the physical device. (Wang Dep. 62:8-18, 212:4-22;
Marineau-Mes Dep. 36:6-23.) It is ""an extremely well-meaning and well-designed feature that is intended to safeguard the
privacy and security of Apple iPhone users[.]"" (Pl.’s SOF § 18.) The boot chain is ""secure"" because each step must be
verified before the next step can proceed. (Wang Dep. 212:4-22; PI.’s SOF 4 17.)

Buddy program : When iOS is freshly installed on an Apple device, a program called ""Buddy"" runs. The ""Buddy"" program
helps the user set up iOS on the device. One portion of the ""Buddy"" program presents the EULA governing that version of
iOS to the user on the iOS device. A user must accept the EULA before the user can continue to interact with any other part


--- Page 3 ---
of iOS. If the user does not accept the EULA, the Buddy program prevents the user from further accessing iOS. (Andrews
Decl. § 17.)

Trust Cache : The trust cache is a list of trusted applications that Apple has approved for execution on iOS. The trust cache
prevents users from installing and operating unapproved applications on iOS. The trust cache prevents the installation of
rogue software and ensures that only-Apple-verified applications can be run on iOS. (Pl.’s SOF 4 21.)

Pointer Authentication Codes (or PAC) : This hardware feature works with Apple software to protect iOS and makes it
""difficult or impossible"" for the kernel to run on non-Apple platform. (Krstic Dep. 132:25-133:17, 140:23-141:18, 142:19-
143:3.) Apple began implementing custom PAC with the release of iOS 12.0 for the iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max in
September 2018. (Pl.’s SOF § 22.) PAC is a cryptographic signature Apple inserts and stores in various places in iOS code
to ensure that the code is executed as intended, without modification or distortion. When the device processor receives
certain instructions, it generates the cryptographic measurement for the next instruction it has been asked to execute. If the
measurement does not match the stored PAC, the processor will halt execution. ( /d. )

D. THE CORELLIUM PRODUCT

Corellium was founded in August 2017. (Gorton Dep. [DE 472-25] 20:8; Skowronek Dep. [DE 472-20] 46:21—47:2.)
Development of a prototype of the Corellium Product began around summer 2017. (Gorton Dep. 33:5-21.) By January 2018,
Corellium was able to demo the creation of a virtual device and was able to use the virtual device in basic ways. (Gorton
Dep. 33:22-34:20). Corellium developed both a cloud (or online) version and an on-premises version (i.e., where the
customer purchases and installs a server on their premises) of

[510 F.Supp.3d 1279]

the Corellium Product. By the end of January 2018, a trial version (Version 1.1) of the cloud-based product was offered to a
limited number of users for beta testing (to detect bugs and any usability issues) and business development. (Gorton Dep.
52:23-53:9; Def.’s Fourth Am. Ans. to First Interr. No. 1 [DE 470-9].)

The Corellium Product enables users to create and interact with virtual devices by loading firmware (that is, files for
operating systems like iOS, Android, and Linux). (Def.’s SOF 30.) Virtualization is the ability to run software on hardware it
is not ordinarily meant to run on. (Wang Dep. 55:10-21.) Among other reasons, virtualization is beneficial because it permits
the user to run software on faster hardware and permits examination and debugging of the software to get a better
understanding of how it works. (Wang Dep. 55:10-21.) According to Corellium's founders, the Corellium Product was
developed with the primary intent of facilitating security testing, research, and development by, inter alia , allowing
researchers to examine aspects of iOS code. (Wade Dep. 179:17-20, 180:12-13; Wang Dep. 210:9-212:3; Gorton Dep.
50:20-51:5; Skowronek Dep. 71:18-23, 96:21-97:2.) Security research is an activity designed to find unintended and
unknown weaknesses in a system, including through source code inspection and certain runtime debugging. (Krstic Dep.
123:12-124:3.) Among other things, security researchers are interested in whether software has vulnerabilities and how and
if those vulnerabilities can be exploited and defended against. (Wang Dep. 249:17-22.) Security researchers include, for
example, members of Apple's Security Bug Bounty Program, a program that rewards researchers who help find
vulnerabilities in Apple's products. (Krstic Dep. 181:5-9.) Vulnerability is a technical term for a bug that has security impact;
that is, if exploited, it can undermine the security of the user's system. (Krstic Dep. 102:4-6. 2) Security researchers can use
their talent for good or for nefarious purposes. (PI.’s SOF § 61.)

Turning back to the Corellium Product, Corellium directly sells to customers and has, until recently, used a reseller for the
on-premises version of the product. £ (Gorton Dep. 15:1-16:2, 53:15-54:14, 125:17-19, 127:1-11.) For its direct sales,
Corellium has a vetting process. (Gorton Dep. 52:14-18, 116:7-126:6; Dyer Dep. [DE 472-32] 32:2-36:15, 39:13-40:14,
46:14-57:13.) Generally, upon receiving an inquiry, the process begins with an initial evaluation. This initial analysis takes
several factors into consideration, including whether the inquiry came from an enterprise account or from an individual
account (e.g., a Gmail account). Corellium also considers the nature of the content of the inquiry and whether it comports
with Corellium's intended use for its product. For example, if the inquiry requests the ability to run iOS on an Android mobile
device, Corellium discards it. Similarly, if there are red flags based on the identity of a putative customer (e.g., someone
involved with unlawful activity) or based on the geographic origins of the request, Corellium does not engage.

If Corellium finds, after the initial evaluation, that the request might be a qualified lead, it responds and starts a line of
communication with the putative customer. Discussions at this stage may entail a telephone

[510 F.Supp.3d 1280

conversation, demo of the Corellium Product, providing a data sheet of product features and pricing or an order form with
license terms, or an offer of a trial period in the cloud. In some cases, Corellium also continues to investigate the potential
customer to determine, for instance, the nature of their business and their affiliations. Red flags during this investigation may
result in a decision by Corellium not to continue to engage with the company. [Redacted]. (Gorton Dep. 123:3-124:25,
163:8-164:7; Dyer Dep. 143:9-144:5, 150:15-153:11.) The vetting process is similar for the on-premises and cloud versions
of the Corellium Product, except that for the cloud product, Corellium may sell to locations they are not otherwise
comfortable shipping servers to. (Gorton Dep. 125:21-126:6.)

In terms of Corellium's control of the use of its product, customers are not required to report bugs or vulnerabilities in iOS to
Apple or Corellium. (Gorton Dep. 128:7-130:16.) However, for the cloud product, if there are concerns regarding malicious


--- Page 4 ---
activity, Corellium can log into an account, investigate, and terminate the account, if necessary. (Gorton Dep. 98:1-6, 99:13-
17, 107:10-20; Wade Dep. 204:4-15, 205:14-207:16, 208:24-15.) Corellium does not have the same control over the on-
premises version of the Corellium Product; there is no way to even know where the product is after it has been shipped from
Corellium, and customers are not required to keep the product in a particular location upon sale. Instead, Corellium asserts
that it relies on the legal enforcement of licensing or end user agreements to ensure that its customers comply with any legal
requirements.

Corellium's CEO and its Vice President of Sales and Business Development testified that the typical inquiry received
pertains to application security testing, operating system security testing, training, and ""miscellaneous."" ""Miscellaneous""
requests are not received often but might include things like continuous integration or the development of tools, such as
forensics tools. (Gorton Dep. 118:4-24; see also Dyer Dep. 48:5-17, 83:9-105:15.) While Corellium may engage with iOS
app developers, these developers are not target customers, and Corellium generally does not advertise for application
development, because the Corellium Product ""is designed for security testing and research particularly,"" and ""[t]he price
point makes it unattractive to app developers ...."" (Gorton Dep. 118:14-24.)

Once Corellium decides to sell the product, for either version of the Corellium Product, customers must pay an annual
licensing fee and must purchase a server. Additionally, if the user chooses the Enterprise or Premium edition of the
Corellium Product they must pay an upgrade fee. (Gorton Dep. 92:13-95:21; Dyer Dep. 66:1-24.) On-premises customers
perform their own install and upgrades and manage their network. (Gorton Dep. 98:23-99:2; Wang Dep. 99:23-103:7, 106:4-
7.) Prior to April 2018, upon setting up the hardware and IP settings, an on-premises customer would not need to take
additional steps to setup, as firmware (e.g., IPSW file) links were provided by ipsw.me. (Def.’s Fourth Am. Ans. to First
Interr. No. 2.) However, for versions of the Corellium Product released between April 2018 and March 2019, an additional
step of obtaining IPSW files must be performed and the files must be placed in [Redacted]. (Def.’s Fourth Am. Ans. to First
Interr. No. 2.) Then, for versions of the Corellium Product released during or after March 2019, there are additional steps to
get to the directory permitting download of the IPSW files required to set up iOS devices. (Def.’s Fourth Am. Ans. to First
Interr. No. 2.) The setup for cloud-based customers is more straightforward; users log into their online account to get
started.

[510 F.Supp.3d 1281]

At the point users are ready to create a virtual iOS device, Corellium maintains an IPSW database which matches physical
devices with available versions of iOS and the associated internet download addresses (URLs) for each IPSW file. (Pl.’s
SOF 4 51.) From early 2019 until February 2020, Corellium's cloud interface included a ""dropdown"" menu that enabled its
customers to select from a prepopulated list of iOS versions and iOS Devices. The customer would pick a version of iOS and
device from that menu (e.g., iPhone 11 Max running iOS 13), and the Corellium Product would automatically download the
associated IPSW file from Apple's servers. (PI.’s SOF § 52.) Corellium also instructs its customers on how to manually
download IPSW files from Apple's servers and then load or import those files into the Corellium Product to create iOS virtual
devices. (Pl.’s SOF § 53.) Thus, customers obtain IPSW files by manual download or by a Corellium program that automates
downloading the IPSW files from Apple servers. On-premises customers have the option of saving IPSW files manually.
(Def.’s SOF 4 55.) Each time a Cloud user wants an IPSW file, the user must download it from Apple's servers; Corellium
does not save the IPSW file on its system. (Wang Dep. 152:18-153:1. 2)

The Corellium Product dynamically unpacks IPSW files as they are downloading. (Def.’s SOF { 53.) The files are
""transiently stored"" until they can be transferred to the right compute node and translated, and are there for a ""very short
amount of time."" (Wang Dep. 173:8-17; Skowronek Dep. 116:2-117:1, 119:13-120:22, 166:8-19.) Additionally, in creating
virtual devices, the Corellium Product does not use iOS in the form in which it exists within the downloaded IPSW files.
Rather, once a user loads the firmware, the Corellium Product ""transforms"" iOS by [Redacted] 8. (Def.’s SOF 66. 2) Thus,
ollowing the transformation process, the software involved in creating the virtual device derives from a combination of
Corellium's code and Apple's iOS code. (Wang Dep. 158:13-159:16, 161:15-162:5, 195:17-23; Andrews Dep. 102:23-
103:16.) Additionally, Corellium ordinarily avoids using encrypted parts of the IPSW files because it cannot decrypt them.
(Wang Dep. 64:2-15, 65:4-12, 259:19-24.) However, if a user has an unencrypted version of otherwise encrypted portions of
he firmware, the Corellium Product allows the user to load it and see those portions displayed in the Corellium Product.
(Gorton Dep. 96:9-19.)

E. ACQUISITION EFFORTS

Between January 2018 and the summer of 2018, the parties engaged in discussions regarding Apple's potential acquisition
of Corellium. During this time, the parties met in-person and telephonically. Corellium explained to Apple the technology
behind the Corellium Product and how it works, and discussed Corellium's business and intention to commercialize the
Corellium Product. 12In addition to several engineers,

510 F.Supp.3d 1282]

discussions involved Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, the Vice President of OS Software
Engineering, and the Head of Apple's Security Engineering and Architecture. ( See Federighi, Andrews, & Krstic Dep., supra
n.10.) Corellium also provided Apple with a temporary account or administrative access to the Corellium Product. (Andrews
Dep. 50:15-54:9, 60:15-20, 168:17-25.) While Apple's legal department did not formally discuss copyright violations with
Corellium, there is a dispute as to whether, and to what extent, Corellium was told by Apple employees that Corellium
needed a license to utilize iOS in connection with the Corellium Product. (Wade Dep. 276:4-15, 278:1-5; Federighi Dep.


--- Page 5 ---
42:9-44:8, 115:12-14, 128:2-9, 132:8-133:4.)

If Apple had acquired the Corellium Product, the product would have been used internally for testing and validation (that is,
for verifying any system weaknesses and functioning of devices). (Marineau-Mes Dep. 27:3-22, 121:17-19; Krstic Dep.
171:22-25; Smith Dep. 61:16-19.) Even with the Corellium Product, Apple would still need physical iPhones to conduct its
testing. (Wade Dep. 210:20-21; Marineau-Mes Dep. 200:10-202:18.) Generally, the Corellium Product received positive
feedback from Apple employees. (Andrews Dep. 159:13-16, 192:23-193:15; Krstic Dep. 106:5-10.) But there were also
concerns, including regarding its utility and long-term value to Apple. (Krstic Dep. 106:5-107:12, 110:9-22.)

The parties ultimately could not agree on a price and, as a result, acquisition efforts were unfruitful. Roughly a year after
talks fell apart, Apple filed this suit. ( See Compl. [DE 1].)

F. SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT

In the Second Amended Complaint [DE 589], Apple asserts claims against Corellium for Direct Federal Copyright
Infringement (Computer Programs), 17 U.S.C. § 501, Direct Federal Copyright Infringement (Graphical User Interface
Elements), 17 U.S.C. § 501, Contributory Federal Copyright Infringement, 17 U.S.C. § 501, and Unlawful Trafficking, 17
U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(2), (b), 1203. Apple contends that Corellium infringed on the following products:

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, ""summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,
322, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . ""[G]enuine disputes of facts are those in which the evidence is such that a
reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant."" Mann v. Taser Int'l, Inc., 588 F.3d 1291 , 1303 (11th Cir. 2009)
(internal marks and citation omitted). A fact is material if, under the applicable substantive law, it might affect the outcome of
the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) .

A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial responsibility of supporting its motion and identifying those portions of
the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex._477 U.S. at 323 , 106

truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial."" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249 , 106 S.Ct. 2505 .
The Court ""must view all the evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most
favorable to the nonmoving party and must resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant.""_Rioux

DISCUSSION

Apple's claims fall in two buckets: copyright infringement and violation of section 1201 of the DMCA. In its motion, Corellium
argues it is entitled to summary judgment in its favor because (1) the Corellium

[510 F.Supp.3d 1284]

Product contains no copyrighted Apple code, (2) the fair use doctrine makes any use of protectable elements of Apple's
work permissible, (3) Apple misused its copyright, (4) Apple should be estopped from asserting a copyright claim against
Corellium, (5) Apple cannot show that Corellium infringed any of the 17 copyrights at issue in the Second Amended
Complaint, ++ and (6) the Corellium Product does not violate the DMCA. Apple also moves for partial summary judgment on
the DMCA issue, arguing it is entitled to summary judgment in its favor because Corellium violated the antitrafficking
provisions of the statute.

Before turning to the DMCA, the Court will analyze the copyright claim. If the Court agrees that the fair use doctrine applies,
Corellium's other arguments are rendered moot. Thus, the Court will address that argument first.

I. COPYRIGHT CLAIM
A. The Copyright Clause
The Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution provides:

The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited
Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries ....

U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 8. The Copyright Clause is ""both a grant of power and a limitation,"" and ""to the extent [Congress]
enacts copyright laws at all,"" such laws must ""promote the Progress of Science."" Eldred v. Ashcroft , 537 U.S. 186 , 212, 123
S.Ct. 769 , 154 L.Ed.2d 683 (2003) . Indeed, ""[t]he primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but

‘[t]lo promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.’ "" Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. 340 , 349,111
S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (citing the Copyright Clause). Even in the technological era, ""the Copyright Act must be

construed in light of this basic purpose."" _Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken , 422 U.S. 151 , 156, 95 S.Ct. 2040 , 45
L.Ed.2d 84 (1975) .

B. Fair Use

From the infancy of copyright protection, courts have recognized that some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials
is necessary to fulfill copyright’s purpose of promoting ""the Progress of Science and useful Arts.""""Campbell v. Acuff-Rose
Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (citing the Copyright Clause). ""If copyright's
utilitarian goal is to be met, we must be careful not to place overbroad restrictions on the use of copyrighted works, because
to do so would prevent would-be authors from effectively building on the ideas of others.""_Cambridge Univ. Press v. Patton
769 F.3d 1232 , 1238 (11th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). ""In a sense, the grant to an author of copyright in a work is
predicated upon a reciprocal grant to the public by the work's author of an implied license for fair use of the work."" /d. at
1257 (citation omitted). ""[C]opyright is not an inevitable, divine, or natural right that confers on authors the absolute
ownership of their creations. It is designed rather to stimulate activity and progress in the arts for the intellectual enrichment
of the public."" /d. at 1256.

""Some unpaid use of copyrighted materials must be allowed in order to prevent copyright from functioning as a straightjacket
that stifles the very creative

[510 F.Supp.3d 1285]

activity it seeks to foster."" /d. at 1238. ""If we allow too much unpaid copying, however, we risk extinguishing the economic
incentive to create that copyright is intended to provide."" /d. Therefore, ""a secondary user who takes overmuch in the name
of fair use operates outside the bounds of his or her implied-by-law license."" /d. at 1257.

Pursuant to its authority under the Copyright Clause, Congress codified the judicially-created fair use defense, ""to ensure
that copyright protection advances rather than thwarts the essential purpose of copyright ...."" Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static
Control Components, Inc. , 387 F.3d 522 , 537 (6th Cir. 2004). Section 107 of the Copyright Act provides:

[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies ... for purposes such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or
research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular
case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;


--- Page 7 ---
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
17 U.S.C. § 107.

The enumerated examples (e.g., criticism, comment, and research) are meant to give some idea of the sort of activities
courts might regard as fair use under the circumstances. Patton__769 F.3d at 1259 . ""This listing was not intended to be
exhaustive, or to single out any particular use as presumptively a ‘fair’ use."" /d. (citation omitted). Likewise, the four statutory
factors are not exclusive. Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. , 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d
588 (1985) . However, they ""establish the contours within which a court may investigate whether, in a given case, a finding
of fair use would serve the objectives of copyright."" /d. These factors are not to be treated in isolation one from another.
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Rather, ""[a]ll are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of
the purposes of copyright.” /d. Still, some factors may weigh more heavily on the fair use determination than others. Patton.
769 F.3d at 1260 ; see, e.g. , Campbell__510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (noting that the second factor—nature of the work
—is generally not important in determining whether a finding of fair use is justified in the case of a parody); Harper & Row

Publishers__471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (noting that the fourth factor—effect on market value—""is undoubtedly the
single most important element of fair use."").

""The affirmative defense of fair use is a mixed question of law and fact as to which the proponent carries the burden of
proof."" Peter Letterese & Assocs., Inc. v. World Inst. Of Scientology Enters. , 533 F.3d 1287 , 1307 n.21 (11th Cir. 2008).
Thus, the burden is on Corellium to ""convince the court that allowing [its] unpaid use of copyrighted material would be
equitable and consonant with the purposes of copyright."" Patton._769 F.3d at 1238 . Where material facts are not in dispute,

fair use is appropriately decided on summary judgment. See, e.g. , Stewart v. Abend , 495 U.S. 207 , 214, 236-38, 110 S.Ct.
1750 , 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) .

With these principles in mind, the Court now analyzes each of the relevant factors.
[510 F.Supp.3d 1286]
1. Purpose and character of the allegedly infringing use

Under this first factor, courts consider ""(1) the extent to which the use is a ‘transformative’ rather than merely superseding
use of the original work and (2) whether the use is for a nonprofit educational purpose, as opposed to a commercial
purpose."" Patton_._769 F.3d at 1261 . These facets do not create ""hard evidentiary presumption[s]"" or ""categories of
presumptively fair use."" Campbell 510 U.S. at 584 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . In other words, ""the mere fact that a use is
educational and not for profit does not insulate it from a finding of infringement, any more than the commercial character of a
use bars a finding of fairness."" /d. Rather, the commercial or non-transformative uses of a work are to be regarded as
""separate factor[s] that tend[ ] to weigh against a finding of fair use,"" and ""the force of that tendency will vary with the
context."" /d. at 585, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (citation omitted).

a. Transformative

In deciding if the alleged infringing use of the copyrighted work is transformative, courts consider "" ‘whether the new work
merely supersede[s] the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different
character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.’ "" Patton__769 F.3d at 1262 (citing Campbell__510
U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). ""Even verbatim copying ‘may be transformative so long as the copy serves a different
function than the original work.’ "" /d. (citation omitted). While a transformative use is "" ‘not absolutely necessary for a finding
of fair use,’ ... transformative uses tend to favor a fair use finding because a transformative use is one that communicates
something new and different from the original or expands its utility, thus serving copyright's overall objective of contributing
to public knowledge."" Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 214 (2d Cir. 2015) (citing Campbell__510 U.S. at 579 ,
114 S.Ct. 1164 ). Thus, copying from an original for the purpose of criticism or commentary on the original or to provide
information about it, tends most clearly to satisfy the notion of the ‘transformative’ purpose involved in the analysis of factor
one. Id. at 215-16. ""The more the appropriator is using the copied material for new, transformative purposes, the more it
serves copyright's goal of enriching public knowledge and the less likely it is that the appropriation will serve as a substitute
for the original or its plausible derivatives, shrinking the protected market opportunities of the copyrighted work."" /d. at 214
(citing Campbell_510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

Apple disagrees with Corellium that the Corellium Product is transformative. According to Apple, the Corellium Product is
not transformative because Corellium merely modifies iOS and ""offers the software in a different medium—virtually, rather

than on a physical device."" (Pl.’s Resp. [DE 557-1] at 13.) For support, Apple cites cases like_Oracle America. Inc. v. Google

LLC , 886 F.3d 1179 , 1187 (Fed. Cir. 2018), where courts found the mere repackaging of copyrighted material from one
medium to the next, without new content or meaning, to be non-transformative.

Here, the evidence establishes that the Corellium Product is not merely a repackaged version of iOS—this time in a virtual


--- Page 8 ---
environment as opposed to an iPhone. Rather, Corellium makes several changes to iOS and incorporates its own code to
create a product that serves a transformative purpose. The Corellium Product makes available significant information about
iOS, permitting users to, inter alia: (1) see and halt running processes; (2) modify the kernel; (3) use CoreTrace, a tool to
view system calls; (4) use an app

510 F.Supp.3d 1287]

browser and a file browser; and (5) take live snapshots. These features are beneficial to security research. And, as Apple
concedes, the Corellium Product adds significant features that are not available on Apple's devices running iOS.

Unequivocally, this case is not like Oracle . In Oracle , the defendant, Google, copied verbatim the declaring code of a
number of the plaintiff's copyrighted and patented application programming interface (""API"") packages; made no alteration to
he expressive content or message; and used the API packages in Google's competing Android operating system for the
same purpose as plaintiff's use of API packages in its own platform. 886 F.3d at 1185-1211 . Oracle is distinguishable from
his case, where Corellium transforms iOS and adds new content, Corellium is not a direct competitor with Apple in the iOS
device market, and the Corellium Product has functionalities not available on Apple's iOS devices.

The Court finds that the purpose of the Corellium Product in this case is more akin to Google's transformative search and
snippet function in Authors Guild . In that case, the plaintiffs—authors of published books under copyright—sued Google for
copyright infringement. 804 F.3d at 206-11 . Acting without the authors’ permission, Google made digital copies of tens of
millions of books that were submitted to it in connection with its Library Project and its Google Books project. Id. Google
scanned the digital copies and established a publicly available search function, which allowed internet users to search
without charge to determine whether the book contains a specified word or term and see ""snippets"" of text containing the
searched-for terms. /d. Google also allowed the participating libraries to download and retain digital copies of books, and
Google retained the original scanned image of each book and all the digital information created in the process on its servers.
Id.

Google argued that its actions constituted fair use. /d. at 211, 214-19. The plaintiffs disagreed. On the issue of
transformativeness, plaintiffs argued that Google's digital copying of entire books, the snippet feature (which allowed users
to read portions of the book), and Google's distribution of digital copies to the libraries did not constitute transformative use
but, rather, provided a substitute for plaintiffs’ works and subjected plaintiffs to the risk of loss of copyright revenues through
access allowed by libraries. /d. The Second Circuit rejected plaintiffs’ arguments and sustained the district court's finding of
fair use.

Finding Google's search function and snippet view to be transformative, the Second Circuit explained that ""the purpose of
Google's copying of the original copyrighted books is to make available significant information about those books, permitting
a searcher to identify those that contain a word or term of interest"" and ""to learn the frequency of usage of selected words in
he aggregate corpus of published books in different historical periods."" /d. Snippet view, which was ""designed to show the
searcher just enough context surrounding the searched term to help her evaluate whether the book falls within the scope of
her interest,"" added ""to the highly transformative purpose of identifying books of interest to the searcher."" /d.

Here, like Google's search and snippet functions, the Corellium Product makes available significant information about iOS. A
user can see running processes, halt execution of the virtual device, amend the kernel, look at lists of files, clone snapshots,
among other things—giving great introspection into aspects of iOS and its operation on iOS devices. These tools are useful
‘0 security research and testing.

510 F.Supp.3d 1288]

The product creates a new, virtual platform for iOS and adds capabilities not available on Apple's iOS devices. See Sony
Comput. Entm't, Inc. v. Connectix Corp. , 203 F.3d 596 , 599, 606 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding fair use where defendant made
intermediate copies of defendant's copyrighted software program and, by reverse engineering, created defendant's own
software program which emulated the functioning of plaintiff's game console so users could play plaintiff's games on their
computer as opposed to on the console; the court found that the alleged infringing work was ""modestly transformative""
because it (1) created a new platform or environment in which consumers could play games designed for plaintiff's product,
and (2) notwithstanding the similarity of uses and functions between the copyrighted and secondary work, defendant's
program was ""a wholly new product"").

Finally, Apple argues that the Corellium Product does not serve a transformative purpose because it can be used for other
purposes other than security research and Corellium has been willing to sell to anyone (presumably, meaning not just to
security researchers). This argument is not persuasive. To start, it is settled that an alleged infringing work does not need to
fall within the enumerated examples of section 107 (e.g., research) to constitute fair use. Further, Apple provides no
authority to support its position that potential unintended use or a secondary use for an alleged infringing product precludes
a finding of fair use, where otherwise there is evidence that the product serves some transformative purpose. In fact,
caselaw seems to indicate otherwise. For example, in A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye v. iParadigms, LLC_,_ 562 F.3d 630 , 634 (4th
Cir. 2009), the defendant owned and operated an online technology system used by schools to evaluate originality of written
works to prevent plagiarism. The technology gave schools the option of ""archiving"" or storing students’ written assignment,
which then became a part of the defendant's database to evaluate the originality of other students’ works in the future. /d.



--- Page 9 ---
The plaintiffs—the students—argued that the defendant's use of their works could not be transformative because the
archiving process added nothing but, rather, merely stored the work unaltered and in its entirety. /d. at 639. The appellate
court was not persuaded. It held that ""the use of a copyrighted work need not alter or augment the work to be transformative
in nature."" /d. And, defendant's use of plaintiffs’ works was transformative because it had an entirely different function and
purpose than the original works. /d. The students then argued that defendant's work failed to ""effect"" its purported
transformative purpose. /d. at 639-40. Rejecting this argument, the appellate court explained that the ""question of whether a
use is transformative does not rise or fall on whether the use perfectly achieves its intended purpose."" /d. The fact that the
defendant's system did detect some level of plagiarism was sufficient, even if it was an imperfect system. /d. (citing
Campbell__510 U.S. at 582 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

Here, there is evidence in the record to support Corellium's position that its product is intended for security research and, as
Apple concedes, can be used for security research. Further, Apple itself would have used the product for internal testing had
it successfully acquired the company. Both Corellium's CEO and its VP of Sales have testified to the use cases for the
Corellium Product for which they fielded inquiries. These inquiries pertain to, for example, application security testing and
operating system security testing. Apple has presented no evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on this point.
Apple points to the testimony of Corellium's reseller. In the quoted portion of the

[510 F.Supp.3d 1289]

transcript, the deponent merely speculates—stating he "" believe/s]"" (not ""knows"")—that Corellium wanted to ""sell their
product to whoever was interested in acquiring it."" (Azimuth Dep. 102:25-103:3.) The deponent offers no facts that contradict
evidence presented by Corellium regarding the use of the Corellium Product for security research.

Therefore, the Court finds that the Corellium Product serves a transformative purpose.
b. Nonprofit educational versus commercial purpose

Concerning this aspect of the first factor of the fair use analysis, Apple argues that because the Corellium Product is sold
commercially, and for significant amounts, those facts compel a finding in Apple's favor. (Pl.’s Resp. at 13.) Not so. To the
contrary, the Supreme Court has cautioned against drawing presumptions against commercial fair uses. See Campbell__510
U.S. at 583-85 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (reversing appellate court finding that alleged infringing work done for profit could not be fair
use and reiterating that the commercial or nonprofit character of a work is not conclusive but merely factors to be weighed
under the fair use analysis). Furthermore, ""the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other
factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use."" /d. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . ""Many of the most
universally accepted forms of fair use ... are all normally done commercially for profit."" Authors Guild__804 F.3d at 219 .

The Court has found that the Corellium Product is transformative; it adds something new to iOS, with a further purpose or
different character than Apple's iOS devices. Hence, Corellium's profit motivation does not undermine its fair use defense,
particularly considering the public benefit of the product.

Therefore, both facets of the first factor favor a finding of fair use.
2. Nature of the copyrighted work

This second factor recognizes that there is a hierarchy of copyright protection depending upon the nature of the copyrighted

work. Peter Letterese & Assocs.__533 F.3d at 1312 (citation omitted). ""Works that are ‘closer to the core of intended
copyright protection,’ and thus merit greater protection, include original as opposed to derivative works; creative as opposed

to factual works; and unpublished as opposed to published works."" /d. (citation omitted). ""Although ‘software products are

not purely creative works,’ it is well established that copyright law protects computer software."" Oracle Am.__886 F.3d at
1204 (citation omitted).

That said, there are significant limitations on copyright protection for software. See, e.g., Sony Comput. Entm't._203 F.3d at
602 (concluding that defendant's intermediate copying and use of plaintiff's software program was a fair use for the purpose
of gaining access to the unprotected elements of plaintiff's software, and explaining that while the ""object code of a program
may be copyrighted as expression ... it also contains ideas and performs functions that are not entitled to copyright
protection.""); Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google Inc. , 750 F.3d 1339 , 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (""Under the merger doctrine, a court will
not protect a copyrighted work from infringement if the idea contained therein can be expressed in only one way. For
computer programs, ‘this means that when specific [parts of the code], even though previously copyrighted, are the only and
essential means of accomplishing a given task, their later use by another will not amount to infringement.’ "") (internal citation
omitted). These limitations on copyright protection for software are important; they ensure that the primary objective

[510 F.Supp.3d 1290]

of copyright—the progress of science and art—continues to be served. See Feist Publ'ns, Inc.__499 U.S. at 349 , 111 S.Ct.

1282 (citing the Copyright Clause) ; Sega Enters. Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc. , 977 F.2d 1510 , 1527 (9th Cir. 1992), as amended
(Jan. 6, 1993).

Corellium argues that, based on the interest of security researchers, the Corellium Product makes use of the functional


--- Page 10 ---
aspects of iOS, as opposed to Apple's creativity, and those functional aspects are not protectable. In response, Apple briefly
states that iOS is ""sophisticated,"" ""popular,"" and its ""development necessarily involved significant creativity,"" but does not
otherwise mount an adequate challenge to Corellium's position.

While the Court notes the limitations on copyright protection for software, in the end, this ""factor has rarely played a

significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute."" Authors Guild__804 F.3d at 220 . Thus, the Court moves to the
next factor.

3. Size and significance of portion of the copyrighted work that was copied

""This third factor examines whether defendants have helped themselves overmuch of the copyrighted work in light of the

purpose and character of the use."" Patton__769 F.3d at 1271 (citation and internal marks omitted). Apple contends that
Corellium has done so, by extracting, copying, publicly displaying, and modifying iOS.

The quantity of the copyrighted work copied does not give rise to any presumption. To the contrary, ""courts have rejected

any categorical rule that a copying of the entirety [of the copyrighted work] cannot be a fair use."" Authors Guild__804 F.3d at
221 .""Even verbatim copying may be transformative so long as the copy serves a different function than the original work.""

Patton_._769 F.3d at 1262 (internal marks and citation omitted). ""Complete unchanged copying has repeatedly been found
justified as fair use when the copying was reasonably appropriate to achieve the copier's transformative purpose and was

done in such a manner that it did not offer a competing substitute for the original."" Authors Guild_, 804 F.3d at 221 . So, the
appropriate inquiry under this factor is whether "" ‘the quantity and value of the materials used ... are reasonable in relation to

the purpose of the copying.’ "" Patton_._769 F.3d at 1272 (quoting Campbell__510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). In making

this determination, courts consider not only the quantity of the materials used, but their quality and importance, too. /d. at
1271."" ‘[T]he amount and substantiality of the portion used’ is measured with respect to the ‘copyrighted work as a whole,’

not to the putatively infringing work."" Peter Letterese & Assocs.__ 533 F.3d at 1314 —15 (citation omitted)

Apple argues that, to the extent Corellium users are only interested in a subset of iOS, Corellium's use of iOS is not
proportional as ""the entire IPSW"" is copied. This argument has no merit. iOS is contained in the IPSW files and, therefore, it
is necessary to download and explore the IPSW files to access iOS. Once imported from Apple's servers, to create a virtual
device on the Corellium Product, the files are transiently stored and then modified by altering aspects of iOS and adding
Corellium's own code. This use of the IPSW files is permissible and proportional, particularly considering the transformative
finished product. See, e.g. , Sony Comput. Entm't., 203 F.3d at 602-10 (concluding that defendant's intermediate copying
and use of plaintiff's software program was a fair use); Sega Enters.__977 F.2d at 1527-28 (""[W]here disassembly is the only
way to gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a
legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly

[510 F.Supp.3d 1291]

is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law.""); Authors Guild_, 804 F.3d at 221 (finding defendant's copying of
entire original copyrighted books permissible because it was necessary to serve the purpose of the alleged infringing work of
making significant information about those books available, permitting a searcher to identify a word or term of interest and to
learn the frequency of usage, and to show the searcher just enough context surrounding the searched term to help her
evaluate whether the book falls within the scope of her interest). 12

Corellium's copying, modifying, and using of iOS is reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying. The testimony is
that the Corellium Product is intended to create a virtual environment in which users can, for instance, examine, test, and
research iOS or portions of iOS code. 12To be an efficient and effective research environment that accurately reflects the
operation of iOS on Apple's devices, the Corellium Product necessarily utilizes iOS. In line with this purpose, the Corellium
Product excludes or does not virtualize the full functionality of features available on iOS devices, like Face ID, Touch ID,
baseband, camera, the App Store, and so on. Users of the Corellium Product cannot make calls or send text messages,
which can be done on an iPhone.

In permitting users to interact with the virtual device, the Corellium Product allows users to view certain graphical user
elements (like the iPhone home screen or wallpaper). The evidence does not reflect that these images serve a central
purpose or are of principal importance to the overall functionality of the Corellium Product, or are a major part of Apple's
complex copyrighted work as a whole. 14 Thus, Corellium's use of these graphical elements does not undermine a finding of
fair use. See, e.g. , Solid Oak Sketches, LLC v. 2K Games, Inc. , 449 F. Supp. 3d 333, 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (finding in case
against an interactive entertainment and video game company brought by licensee of copyrighted tattoos used by
professional basketball players that, while the tattoos were copied in their entirety, defendants did so in order to effectuate
the transformative purpose of creating a realistic game experience); Sony Comput. Entm't Am., Inc. v. Bleem, LLC , 214 F.3d
1022 , 1028-29 (9th Cir. 2000), amended on denial of reh'g (July 10, 2000) (finding in case brought by a manufacturer of
console video games against a developer of a software emulator, alleging that developer's use of ""screen shots"" from
manufacturer's games in developer's advertising violated manufacturer's copyright, that developer's degree of copying was
reasonable where the ""screen shots"" at issue were a small portion of the complex copyrighted work as a whole).

Upon reviewing the evidence, the Court finds that Corellium's use of iOS (in terms of quantity, quality, and importance) is
proportional and necessary to achieve Corellium's transformative purpose. Therefore, this third factor weighs in favor of
finding fair use.


--- Page 11 ---
4. Effect of allegedly infringing use on potential market for or value of the original
""With respect to the fourth factor—the effect of the use on the value
[510 F.Supp.3d 1292]

of the copyrighted material—the relevant question ... is whether the infringement impacted the market for the copyrighted
work itself."" Lexmark Int'l, 387 F.3d at 544 (citation omitted). This factor ""focuses on whether the copy brings to the
marketplace a competing substitute for the original, or its derivative, so as to deprive the rights holder of significant revenues
because of the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original."" Authors Guild.
804 F.3d at 223 . The adverse impact courts are primarily concerned with is that of market substitution.Patton, 769 F.3d at
1275 (citation omitted).

In this lawsuit, Apple asserts 17 copyrights pertaining to iOS; alleged copyrights in 12 versions of iOS released since 2015
and 5 copyrights in visual works of arts contained in iOS (i.e., icons of Apple's built-in applications and wallpaper).
Concerning this fourth factor, there is no evidence that the Corellium Product has affected, let alone materially affected,
Apple's market or the market value for iOS. Instead, Apple argues that Corellium markets its product as an alternative to an
iPhone and lists Apple's ""iOS Simulator"" as a direct competitor. This marketing—whether puffery or factually accurate—is
not evidence that the Corellium Product supplants Apple's market for iOS devices or that it has deprived, or will deprive,
Apple of (significant) revenue made from iOS.

Next, Apple argues that the Corellium Product will compete with its upcoming Security Research Device Program, under
which Apple will be licensing devices running iOS to security researchers in return for the disclosure of security
vulnerabilities and related discoveries to Apple. This argument misses the mark. The relevant question under this fourth
factor is whether the Corellium Product has impacted the market for the copyrighted work itself—that is, for iOS. See, e.g. ,
Lexmark Int'l, 387 F.3d at 545 (noting that the ""the district court focused on the wrong market: it focused not on the value or
marketability of the Toner Loading Program, but on Lexmark's market for its toner cartridges. Lexmark's market for its toner
cartridges and the profitability of its Prebate program may well be diminished by the [defendant's] SMARTEK chip, but that is
not the sort of market or value that copyright law protects.""). Here, while Apple may very well expand into the security
research or virtualization market, copyright law does not confer a monopoly. Sony Comput. Entm't._203 F.3d at 607 .

This principle equally applies to Apple's final argument, that it previously rejected the option of ""licensing exactly this kind of
software"" (that is, a product like the Corellium Product). (Pl.’s Resp. at 17.) ""[A] copyright holder can always assert some
degree of adverse [effect] on its potential licensing revenues as a consequence of the secondary use at issue simply

because the copyright holder has not been paid a fee to permit that particular use."" Patton, 769 F.3d at 1276 (citation
omitted, italics in original). ""The goal of copyright is to stimulate the creation of new works, not to furnish copyright holders

with control over all markets. Accordingly, the ability to license does not demand a finding against fair use."" /d.

The Court does not find any significant market impact on iOS. Thus, this fourth factor also favors a finding of fair use.
5. Good faith and fair dealing

In addition to, or as a part of, the four statutory factors, Apple asks the Court to consider Corellium's lack of good faith and
fair dealing. According to Apple, ""Corellium's conduct has been entirely improper"" because it deals with bad actors and does
not require users to report bugs to Apple.

[510 F.Supp.3d 1293]

Apple's position is puzzling, if not disingenuous. [Redacted]. (Krstic Dep. 184:22-185-10.) Likewise, while Apple spends
significant time in its papers faulting Corellium for not requiring users of the Corellium Product to report bugs found in iOS to
Apple, Apple does not impose that requirement under its own Bug Bounty Program. As for Apple's contention that Corellium
sells its product indiscriminately, that statement is belied by the evidence in the record that the company has a vetting
process in place (even if not perfect) and, in the past, has exercised its discretion to withhold the Corellium Product from
those it suspects may use the product for nefarious purposes. 15

Having reviewed the evidence, the Court does not find a lack of good faith and fair dealing. Further, weighing all the
necessary factors, the Court finds that Corellium has met its burden of establishing fair use. Thus, its use of iOS in
connection with the Corellium Product is permissible. On these grounds, Corellium's Motion for Summary Judgment is
granted on Apple's copyright claim.

Il. DMCA CLAIM

Both Corellium and Apple seek summary judgment on Apple's DMCA claim. The claim is brought under sections 1201 (a)(2)
and (b)(1) of the statute, which together prohibit selling tools to circumvent measures that protect access to, or rights in,
copyrighted material, if the tools: (a) are ""primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological
measure that effectively"" controls access to or protects rights in a copyrighted work; (b) have ""only limited commercially
significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively"" controls access to or protects
rights in a copyrighted work; or (c) are ""marketed ... for use in circumventing a technological measure that effectively""


--- Page 12 ---
controls access to or protects rights in a copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2), (b)(1). Under the DMCA, to ""circumvent a
technological measure"" means to ""to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the
authority of the copyright owner,"" and a technological measure "" ‘effectively controls access to a work’ if the measure, in the
ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the
copyright owner, to gain access to the work."" 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(3).

Apple argues that, at a minimum, Corellium circumvents its authentication server validation check, secure boot chain, Buddy
program, and trust cache. According to Apple, only after circumventing these measures can the Corellium Product run iOS
—which was not designed to run on non-Apple hardware. Corellium disagrees that it circumvents Apple's technological
measures. Corellium argues instead that the IPSW files are ""left unencrypted, unprotected, unlocked, and out in the open for
the public to access, copy, edit, distribute, perform, and display."" (Def.’s Resp. [DE 512] at 1.) Corellium further argues that it
is entitled to a fair use defense, as well as defenses under sections 1201(f), (g), and (j) of the DMCA, which provide
exemptions

[510 F.Supp.3d 1294]

for reverse engineering and security testing and encryption research. The Court begins by examining whether fair use is a
defense to a prima facie section 1201 violation.

A. ""Fair use"" and the DMCA
The DMCA provides:

(c) Other rights, etc., not affected.--(1) Nothing in this section shall affect rights, remedies, limitations, or
defenses to copyright infringement, including fair use , under this title.

17 U.S.C. § 1201(c) (italics added). At first glance, this subsection appears to resolve the issue of a fair use defense. But, as
applied, there may be tension between section 107 ’s fair use and the DMCA's antitrafficking provisions. One court captured
the issue well:

Technological access control measures have the capacity to prevent fair uses of copyrighted works as well as
foul. Hence, there is a potential tension between the use of such access control measures and fair use, [as well
as the much broader range of explicitly noninfringing use]. As the DMCA made its way through the legislative
process, Congress was preoccupied with precisely this issue. Proponents of strong restrictions on circumvention
of access control measures argued that they were essential if copyright holders were to make their works
available in digital form because digital works otherwise could be pirated too easily. Opponents contended that
strong anticircumvention measures would extend the copyright monopoly inappropriately and prevent many fair
uses of copyrighted material. Congress struck a balance ....

Chamberlain Grp.. Inc. v. Skylink Techs., Inc. , 381 F.3d 1178 , 1196-97 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (citing Reimerdes__111 F. Supp. 2d
at 304 ). 16

In Chamberlain , the Federal Circuit suggested, in dicta, that fair use could be a defense to a section 1201 violation. The
court noted that the DMCA does not ""rescind[ ] the basic bargain granting the public noninfringing and fair uses of
copyrighted materials ...."" 381 F.3d at 1202 (citing § 1201(c) ). In reaching that conclusion, the court was wary of allowing
""copyright owner[s], through a combination of contractual terms and technological measures, to repeal the fair use doctrine
...."" Id. Notwithstanding this discussion, the Federal Circuit ultimately stated that it did ""not reach the relationship between §
107 fair use and violations of § 1201."" /d. at 1199 n.14. Neither the Supreme Court nor the Eleventh Circuit has squarely
addressed the issue. And, like the Federal Circuit, the Ninth Circuit has put that decision off for another day. See MDY
Indus., LLC v. Blizzard Entm't, Inc. , 629 F.3d 928 , 950 n.12 (9th Cir. 2010), opinion amended and superseded on denial of

reh'g , No. 09-15932, 2011 WL 538748 (9th Cir. Feb. 17, 2011) (""Like the [court in] Chamberlain ..., we need not and do not
reach the relationship between fair use

[510 F.Supp.3d 1295]

under § 107 of the Copyright Act and violations of § 1201 .... Accordingly, we too leave open the question whether fair use
might serve as an affirmative defense to a prima facie violation of § 1201."").

The Second Circuit, however, has ruled on the issue, and has found that fair use is not a blanket defense to the
circumvention provisions of section 1201 :

[Appellants] contend that subsection 1201(c)(1) ... can be read to allow the circumvention of encryption
technology protecting copyrighted material when the material will be put to ""fair uses"" exempt from copyright
liability. We disagree that subsection 1201(c)(1) permits such a reading. Instead, it simply clarifies that the DMCA
targets the circumvention of digital walls guarding copyrighted material (and trafficking in circumvention tools),
but does not concern itself with the use of those materials after circumvention has occurred. Subsection 1201(c)
(1) ensures that the DMCA is not read to prohibit the ""fair use"" of information just because that information was
obtained in a manner made illegal by the DMCA. The Appellants’ much more expansive interpretation of
subsection 1201(c)(1) is not only outside the range of plausible readings of the provision, but is also clearly


--- Page 13 ---
refuted by the statute's legislative history.

Corley. 273 F.3d at 443 —44 ; see also United States v. Reichert 747 F.3d 445 , 448 (6th Cir. 2014) (""[T]he DMCA ‘targets
the circumvention of digital walls guarding copyrighted material (and trafficking in circumvention tools),’ even though it ‘does
not concern itself with the use of those materials after circumvention has occurred.’ "") (citing Corley, 273 F.3d at 443 ) (italics
in original); Rea/networks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Ass'n, 641 F. Supp. 2d 913 , 941-42 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (""The DMCA
itself is, of course, rooted in the Copyright Act. The DMCA's section 1201(c) merely preserves the general fair use defense
to copyright infringement. It does not create new exemptions, nor does it exempt from liability circumvention tools otherwise
deemed unlawful under sections 1201(a)(2) or (b)(1) .... Fair use is not a defense to trafficking in products used to
circumvent effective technological measures that prevent unauthorized access to, or unauthorized copying of, a copyrighted
work under sections 1201 (a) or (b), respectively .... [However] fair use applies to section 1201(b) under the DMCA because
it does not speak to, and thus does not prohibit, appropriate individual uses of circumvention devices."").

Here, if the Court were to adopt Corellium's position that fair use is a defense to Apple's DMCA claim, that would effectively
render section 1201 meaningless. ""A venerable canon makes clear that an interpreter must, if possible, give effect to every
word and phrase in a statute."" _Darrisaw v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency , 949 F.3d 1302 , 1306 (11th Cir.
2020) (citation). ""[Courts] cannot adopt an interpretation that would render a term meaningless ...."" Id. (citation omitted, italics
in original). Thus, the Court finds that the better reading is that adopted by the Corley court. Therefore, Corellium may make
fair use of iOS, but it is not absolved of potential liability for allegedly employing circumvention tools to unlawfully access iOS
or elements of iOS. As noted earlier, this result may seem to undercut section 107 ’s fair use. However, in passing the
DMCA, Congress adopted a ""balanced"" approach to accommodate both piracy and fair use concerns. Corley, 273 F.3d at
444 n.13. ""The balance embodied in a federal law is not something this court can disturb, absent a Constitutional violation
not at issue here."" Rea/networks, Inc_,641 F. Supp. 2d at 943 . The Court, therefore, rejects Corellium's

[510 F.Supp.3d 1296]
fair use defense in the context of the DMCA.
B. Genuine issues of material facts exist

Issues of material facts preclude entry of summary judgment on this claim. For example, there is the fundamental question
of, and dispute as to, whether Apple has copyrights in all of iOS or only portions of iOS. While Corellium maintains that iOS
is open for public access to support its position that iOS or components of iOS in the IPSW files are not protectable, even
open source material is protectable. Jacobsen v. Katzer , 535 F.3d 1373 , 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (""Copyright holders who
engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material.""). The
parties also dispute the nature of Apple's technological measures and the applicability of those measures to the IPSW files
and, by extension, elements of iOS in those files. Likewise, Corellium alleged statutory defenses raise factual questions that
preclude entry of summary judgment on this claim. Therefore, the parties’ motions are denied as they relate to the DMCA
claim. Accordingly, it is

ORDERED that:
1. Apple's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [DE 470] is DENIED ;
2. Corellium's Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 464] is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED :

a. The Motion is granted on the copyright claims, to the extent the Court finds that Corellium's use of iOS
constitutes fair use;

b. The Motion is denied regarding the DMCA claim.

3. No later than January 11, 2021 , the parties shall each file a status report notifying the Court of any portions of pending
motions rendered moot by this Order.

DONE AND ORDERED in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this 29th day of December 2020.

Notes:

1To the extent the parties agree on the facts and the facts as stated are supported by the evidence, the Court may cite to the parties’ Statements of
Material Facts (""SOF""). Regarding declarations, under the law of this Circuit, ""[w]hen a party has given clear answers to unambiguous questions which
negate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact [for summary judgment], that party cannot thereafter create such an issue with an affidavit that
merely contradicts, without explanation, previously given clear testimony. Such an affidavit would be a sham."" McCormick v. City of Fort Lauderdale

333 F.3d 1234 , 1240 (11th Cir. 2003) (internal citation omitted). Additionally, the Court does not consider evidence that has been stricken pursuant to
the Court's August 24, 2020 Order [DE 658] and the parties’ related Joint Stipulation [DE 722]. Lastly, citations to the record primarily reflect sealed
versions of the document, not the publicly available copies.

3 Regarding source code and object code:


--- Page 14 ---
Computers come down to one basic premise: They operate with a series of on and off switches, using two digits in the binary (base 2)
number system—0 (for off) and 1 (for on). All data and instructions input to or contained in computers therefore must be reduced to ... 1 and
0 .... Some highly skilled human beings can reduce data and instructions to strings of 1's and 0's and thus program computers to perform
complex tasks by inputting commands and data in that form. But it would be inconvenient, inefficient and, for most people, probably
impossible to do so. In consequence, computer science has developed programming languages. These languages, like other written
languages, employ symbols and syntax to convey meaning. The text of programs written in these languages is referred to as source code.
And whether directly or through the medium of another program, the sets of instructions written in programming languages—the source
code—ultimately are translated into machine ""readable"" strings of 1's and 0's, known in the computer world as object code, which typically
are executable by the computer .... All code is human readable. As source code is closer to human language than is object code, it tends to
be comprehended more easily by humans than object code.

Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes , 111 F. Supp. 2d 294 , 306 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), aff'd sub nom. Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley , 273 F.3d
429 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citation omitted).

4The parties disagree on the nature, operation, and purpose of some of these measures.

5""In some context a bug could be different from a vulnerability .... An exploit uses a vulnerability to achieve a purpose,"" such as a jailbreak. (Wang Dep.
51:9-14, 52:15-53:10.) Jailbreaking is a ""mechanism to exploit security vulnerability or allow execution of code that didn't come from [the developer].""
Jailbreaking can be used for good. (Andrews Dep. 97:6-98:13.)

&Corellium contracted with two resellers but only one has engaged in any sales. (Gorton Dep. 15:25-16:16.)
2 There is evidence that, at least once, Corellium provided IPSW files to its reseller for a demo unit. (Azimuth Security, LLC Dep. [DE 557-13] 175:176:4.)
8 [Redacted].

2Corellium uses the term ""transform"" to describe this process, while Apple appears to prefer the word ""modify."" Regardless if it is a ""transformation"" or
""modification,"" there are some changes made once the user loads the IPSW files. Hence, the Court uses the words ""change,"" ""modify,"" and ""transform""
interchangeably.

10 See, e.g. , Gorton Dep. 177:22-178:8, 180:18-181:17; Andrews Dep. 48:23-49:25, 50:15-54:9, 60:15-20, 102:13-22, 112:23-113:13, 133:2-134:4,
162:14-163:12, 168:17-25, 188:17-24; Krstic Dep. 72:12-23, 74:18-75:3, 143:20-144:6, 149:6-15; Wade Dep. 274:4-276:15; Smith Dep. [DE 472-28]
64:13-65:25, 83:18-84:10, 134:4-135:3; Federighi Dep. [DE 472-10] 31:8-23, 73:5-13, 142:8-23.

1 Apple initially identified 22 copyright registrations at issue but has since removed 5 of them. Compare Compl., with Sec. Am. Compl.
12 In this vein, the Court also finds Corellium's download and use of the publicly available IPSW files solely for its own internal testing is permissible.

18 As stated earlier, the Corellium Product is also capable of virtualizing Android and Linux, and it can run any operating system on the virtual Apple

product once it has restore ramdisk. (Wang Dep. 177:10-178:25.) The Corellium Product does not need a particular operating system. /d. Because only
iOS is at issue in this case, the Court focuses on users interacting with iOS.

14 See Wang Dep. 215:4-217:16.

15 The Court does realize that with or without controls in place, the Corellium Product could be used maliciously in the wrong hands. As Apple's Jason
Shirk aptly states: ""Tools are agnostic; It's all the user."" (Shirk Dep. [DE 472-31] 118:24.) The Corellium Product can be used for ""good faith"" security
research and it also very likely can be exploited for nefarious reasons. No technology is infallible. For instance, notwithstanding strong protections put in
place by Apple such as the secure boot chain, just recently the checkm8 exploit was released by security researchers, which enables certain iOS
commercial devices to be jailbroken. (Shirk Dep. 94:11-20.)

18 This year—more than twenty years after the DMCA was enacted—with a series of hearings, Congress has begun to review the DMCA, including a
review of how the DMCA has accounted for fair use, how fair use has been applied in practice, and how a reform bill should think about fair use. See,

e.g. , How Does the DMCA Contemplate Limitations and Exceptions Like Fair Use? , Subcommittee Hearing, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on
Intellectual Property, available at https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/how-does-the-dmca-contemplate-limitations-and-exceptions-like-fair-use (last

Malcolm Seymour, Foster Garvey P.C., New York, NY, for John Doe.

OPINION & ORDER

NELSON S. ROMAN, United States District Judge

This action arises out of a subpoena request under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (""DMCA"") to identify an alleged
infringer of copyrights held by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania (""Watch Tower""), an organization that
publishes religious materials for Jehovah's Witnesses. Movant John Doe, a lapsed Jehovah's Witness who publishes
satirical videos critical of the religious denomination on YouTube, moves to quash the subpoena issued on June 19, 2018,
or, in the alternative, for leave to proceed anonymously. (ECF No. 19.) For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS
Movant's motion to quash the subpoena.

BACKGROUND
I. The Original Works

Between August 2017 and January 2018, Watch Tower created the following four original works, each of which it
subsequently registered with the U.S. Copyright Office on August 3, 2018: (i) ""Never Alone"" (Copyright Registration No:
PA0002131662); (ii) ""Allan Boyle: Deep Study for a Clearer Picture"" (Copyright Registration No: PA0002131659); (iii) ""Keep
a Tight Grip—Through Effective Personal Study"" (Copyright Registration No: PA0002131853); and (iv) ""Mark Noumair:
Keep ‘a Tight Grip on the Word of Life’ "" (Copyright Registration No: PA0002131665). ( See Polidoro Decl., Ex. B, ECF No.
20-2.). Watch Tower further published these four works as a compilation with additional footage titled ""JW Broadcasting —
July 2018,"" which it also registered with the U.S. Copyright Office on August 10, 2018 (Copyright Registration No:
PA0002132168). ( See id. , Ex. C, ECF No. 20-3.).

The subject matter of these works is derived from the Bible and the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses, but they all consist of
creative, expressive, and non-factual works. ( See id. § 7, ECF No. 20.) For example, ""Never Alone"" is a music video
depicting the story of Joseph from the Book of Genesis with musical and actor performances, costumes, sets, lighting, and
sound design. ( SeeJW, Never Alone , https://www.jw.org/en/library/videos/#Hen/mediaitems/VODOriginalSongs/pub-
osg_43 VIDEO (last visited Jan. 13, 2022).) The work titled ""Allan Boyle: Deep Study for a Clearer Picture"" depicts an
interview of the late artist, who discusses how studying the Bible helped him create his religious artwork. ( See JW, Allan
Boyle: Deep Study for a Clearer Picture , https://\www.jw.org/en/library/videos/#en/mediaitems/VODIntExpArchives/pub-
jwb_201807_4 VIDEO (last visited Jan. 13, 2022).) The work titled ""Keep a Tight Grip—Through Effective Personal Study""
depicts several Jehovah's Witnesses discussing their techniques to study the Bible and the benefits they obtain from doing

so. ( SeeJW, Keep

[581 F.Supp.3d 514]

a Tight Grip—Through Effective Personal Study ,
https://www.jw.org/en/library/videos/#en/mediaitems/VODBiblePrinciples/pub-jwb_201807_6 VIDEO (last visited Jan. 13,
2022).) The work titled ""Mark Noumair: Keep ‘a Tight Grip on the Word of Life’ "" depicts Mr. Noumair discussing why
studying the Bible is important for Jehovah's Witnesses and the methods taught at their missionary Gilead School to do so
properly. ( SeeJW, Mark Noumair: Keep ""a Tight Grip on the Word of Life"",
https://www.jw.org/en/library/videos/#Hen/mediaitems/StudioTalks/pub-jwb_201807_2 VIDEO (last visited Jan. 13, 2022).)
And finally, the JW Video is a fifty-three-minute compilation of the previous four works presented as a single broadcasting
program for July 2018, which is part of a series of monthly programs for Watch Tower's viewers. ( See JW, JW Broadcasting
— July 2018 , https://www.jw.org/en/library/videos/#Hen/mediaitems/StudioMonthlyPrograms/pub-jwb_201807_1 VIDEO (last
visited Jan. 13, 2022) [hereinafter, the ""JW Video""].)

Il. The Allegedly Infringing Work

Under the pseudonym of ""Kevin McFree,"" Movant publishes videos on YouTube featuring stop-frame Lego animations set in
a fictitious village called ""Dubtown"" that satirize and criticize the practices of Jehovah's Witnesses. ( See Seymour Decl. 9
6, 8, Ex. 5, ECF Nos. 18, 18-5.) On May 18, 2018, Movant posted a video titled ""DUBTOWN — Family Worship July
Broadcast"" (hereinafter, the ""Dubtown Video""). ( See id. 9.) This thirteen-minute video depicts Lego characters viewing
excerpts of the JW Video (mainly those portraying Watch Tower's other four works), over which Movant interjected,


--- Page 2 ---
superimposed, and overdubbed parodic commentary. ( See id. 4 11, Ex. 11, ECF No. 18-11.) Among other topics, the
Dubtown Video criticizes Jehovah's Witnesses’ depictions of violence against women, the removal of a man of African
descent from the denomination's iconography, the denomination's attitude toward technology, and its attitude toward outside
academic pursuits among its followers. ( See id. , Ex. 11.)

Ill. Procedural History

After learning about the Dubtown Video, Watch Tower sent a copyright infringement DMCA takedown notice to Google on
June 6, 2018, demanding removal of the Dubtown Video from YouTube. +( See Polidoro Decl. { 27.) Google subsequently
removed the Dubtown video from YouTube's platform. ( See id. J 28.)

On June 15, 2018, Watch Tower initiated this action by requesting the Court to issue a DMCA subpoena to YouTube to
identify 2who owns the Kevin McFree Account. (ECF No. 1.) On June 19, 2018, the Court granted the request and directed
the Clerk of Court to issue the subpoena for YouTube (Google Inc.). (ECF No. 4.) On August 22, 2018, counsel appeared on
behalf of Movant and requested leave to file a motion to quash the subpoena, (ECF Nos. 5 & 6), a request that Watch Tower
opposed five days later (ECF No. 7). On August 27, 2020, the Court granted Movant leave to file his proposed motion. (ECF

[581 F.Supp.3d 515]

No. 11.) On November 10, 2020, the parties filed their respective briefing: Movant filed the instant motion (ECF No. 17) with
its accompanying exhibits (ECF No. 18) and a memorandum in support (""Motion,"" ECF No. 19), as well as his reply (""Reply,""
ECF No. 24) with its accompanying exhibits (ECF Nos. 22 & 23); and Watch Tower its opposition (""Response in Opposition,""
ECF No. 19) with its accompanying exhibits (ECF No. 20).

STANDARD

Rule 45 provides that a court ""must quash or modify a subpoena that ... requires disclosure of privileged or other protected
matter, if no exception or waiver applies"" or that ""subjects a person to undue burden."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(A)(iii)-(iv).

A movant seeking a protective order or to quash a subpoena bears the burden of persuasion. See Dove v. Atl. Capital Corp.
963 F.2d 15 , 19 (2d Cir. 1992) ; Kingsway Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Pricewaterhouse-Coopers LLP , No. 03 Civ. 5560 (RMB)
(HBP), 2008 WL 4452134, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2, 2008) (""[T]he party seeking to quash the subpoena bears the burden of
demonstrating that the subpoena is over-broad, duplicative, or unduly burdensome.""). ""A determination to grant or deny a
motion for a protective order or a motion to quash a subpoena is discretionary."" John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Doe Nos. 1-30,
284 F.R.D. 185, 189 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (citing Galella v. Onassis, 487 F.2d 986 , 997 (2d Cir. 1973) ;/n re Subpoena Issued to
Dennis Friedman,_350 F.3d 65 , 68 (2d Cir. 2003) ).

""The Supreme Court has recognized that the First Amendment provides protection for anonymous speech."" Arista Recs.,
LLC v. Doe 3,604 F.3d 110 , 118 (2d Cir. 2010) (collecting cases). ""The Court has also recognized that the Internet is a
valuable forum for the exchange of ideas."" /d. ""To the extent that anonymity is protected by the First Amendment, a court
should quash or modify a subpoena designed to breach anonymity."" /d. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(3)(A) (the ""issuing court
must quash or modify a subpoena"" when it ""requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or
waiver applies"")). ""The First Amendment does not, however, provide a license for copyright infringement."" /d. ""Thus, to the
extent that anonymity is used to mask copyright infringement or to facilitate such infringement by other persons, it is
unprotected by the First Amendment."" /d.

Courts consider the following factors when determining whether to grant a motion to quash based on a qualified privilege
protecting anonymity:

(1) the concreteness of the plaintiff's showing of a prima facie claim of actionable harm, (2) the specificity of the
discovery request, (3) the absence of alternative means to obtain the subpoenaed information, (4) the need for
the subpoenaed information to advance the claim, and (5) the objecting party's expectation of privacy.

Arista__604 F.3d at 119 (cleaned up). Ultimately, decisions about the reasonableness and burden of a subpoena are left to
the sound discretion of the court. See Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe , No. 14-CV-4808 (JS) (SIL), 2016 WL 4574677, at *2
(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 2016).

DISCUSSION

By his motion, Movant argues that the Court should quash the subpoena because (1) Watch Tower cannot state a valid
claim of copyright infringement, particularly because the Dubtown Video makes fair use of Watch Tower's works; and (2) in
the absence of fair use, Watch Tower has misrepresented the true purpose of the subboena—namely, to identify Movant to

[581 F.Supp.3d 516]

""disfellowship him as an apostate."" (Mot. at 13-23.) Alternatively, if the Court does not quash the subpoena, Movant
requests the Court permission to appear anonymously in future proceedings for fear of being ostracized, shunned, or
disfellowshipped by the denomination's community for voicing criticisms or doubts about the organization. 3( /d. at 23-26.)


--- Page 3 ---
In opposition, Watch Tower contends that the Court must deny Movant's motion based on either of two independent
grounds: (i) the motion's untimeliness; and (ii) the Arista factors support sustaining the subpoena. (Resp. in Opp'n at 14-28.)
Watch Tower further contends that the Court should deny Movant's request to proceed anonymously because Movant fails
to show the need to protect a legitimate privacy interest, and because it would be prejudiced in its ability to prosecute a case
of copyright infringement against him. ( /d. at 28-31.)

Accordingly, the Court will address whether Movant satisfies his burden to show that the subpoena is unduly burdensome
and will only consider the merits of Movant's request to proceed anonymously if the subpoena is sustained.

I. The Motion's Timeliness

As a preliminary matter, Watch Tower argues that the Court must deny Movant's motion as untimely because he first
requested leave to file the instant motion on August 22, 2018—over a month after the subpoena's responsive deadline of
July 15, 2018. ( /d. at 14-16.) But Movant contends there is good cause for the Court to overlook the motion's untimeliness.
Specifically, Movant avers that YouTube notified him about the subpoena just five days before its return date, and that it took
him five weeks to locate pro bono counsel after YouTube referred him to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which in turn
referred him to his current counsel. (Reply at 1 n.1 (citing ECF No. 6).)

""It is well settled that, to be timely, a motion to quash a subpoena must be made prior to the return date of the subpoena.""
Est. of Ungar v. Palestinian Auth. . 451 F. Supp. 2d 607 , 610 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) ; Sony Music Ent. Inc. v. Does 1-40_, 326 F.

discretion to consider motions to quash that were not timely filed within the meaning of Rule 45 and applicable case law.""

circumstances, including clearly overbroad nature of subpoena, warranted overlooking timeliness issue); Olszewski v.
Bloomberg L.P. , No. 96 Civ. 3393, 2000 WL 1843236, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 13, 2000) (considering untimely motion to quash
because movant was ""entitled to protection from discovery of his confidential health and disciplinary records"").

While the motion is indisputably untimely, the Court agrees that good cause exists to overlook Movant's delay in filing it. The
record shows that Movant first received

[581 F.Supp.3d 517]

notice of the subpoena five days before its return date and then diligently sought counsel to contest it in good faith. ( See
ECF No. 6 (pre-motion letter dated Aug. 22, 2018).) Besides, Watch Tower raises no claim of prejudice resulting from the
delay; much less does the record support a finding of the same, particularly because, as Movant avers, Watch Tower failed
to aggressively pursue the subpoena's enforcement within the delay period. ( See Reply at 1, n.1.) In view thereof, the Court
now proceeds to analyze the Arista factors based on the record before it.

ll. The Prima Facie Case for Copyright Infringement

The parties do not dispute that Watch Tower holds the copyrights to the protected works that Movant used in creating the
Dubtown Video. ( See Resp. in Opp'n at 16.) Rather, their disagreement lies on whether Movant made fair use of Watch
Tower's works in creating the Dubtown Video. Specifically, Movant contends that he made non-commercial, critical, and
transformative use of Watch Tower's works in creating the Dubtown Video. (Mot. at 17.) In contrast, Watch Tower argues
that the Court should decline to address fair use here based on the ""factually deficient record"" at this stage because courts
generally do not address fair use until the summary judgment phase. (Resp. in Opp'n at 17-18.) Watch Tower further
argues that even if the Court decides to address the issue, the fair use inquiry favors sustaining the subpoena because (1)
Movant ""unlawfully obtained"" Watch Tower's works before publication and (2) the Dubtown Video is commercial in nature
and substantially uses Watch Tower's works quantitatively and qualitatively with little or no transformation. ( /d. at 18-23.)
After reviewing the record, the Court concludes that Movant made fair use of Watch Tower's works.

""The owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to—or to license others to—reproduce, perform publicly, display publicly,
prepare derivative works of, and distribute copies of, his copyrighted work."" Arista__604 F.3d at 117 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 106).
""To establish a prima facie case of copyright infringement, a plaintiff must demonstrate ‘(1) ownership of a valid copyright,
and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.’ "" Warner Bros. Entm't Inc. v. RDR Books, 575 F. Supp.
2d 513 , 533 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (quoting Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113
L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) ). A defendant is deemed to have copied constituent elements of the plaintiff's work where ""(1) the
defendant has actually copied the plaintiff's work; and (2) the copying is illegal because a substantial similarity exists
between the defendant's work and the protectible elements of plaintiff's."" Hamil Am.. Inc. v. GFI, 193 F.3d 92 , 99 (2d Cir.
1999) (quoting Knitwaves. Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd. 71 F.3d 996 , 1002 (2d Cir. 1995) ).

""The defendant can defeat a prima facie showing of infringement,"" however, ""by proving that the doctrine of ‘fair use’


--- Page 4 ---
permits"" his or her ""employment of the plaintiff's [work]."" Tufenkian Imp./Exp. Ventures, Inc. v. Einstein Moomiy. Inc. , 338
F.3d 127 , 131 (2d Cir. 2003) ;see 17 U.S.C. § 107 (codifying the common-law fair use defense). That is because fair use
""allows the public to use not only facts and ideas contained in a copyrighted work, but also expression itself in certain
circumstances."" Eldred v. Ashcroft , 537 U.S. 186 , 219, 123 S.Ct. 769 , 154 L.Ed.2d 683 (2003) ; see also Sony Corp. of
America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. , 464 U.S. 417 , 432-33, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (copyright law ""has
never accorded the copyright owner complete control over all possible uses of his work""). Put another

[581 F.Supp.3d 518]

way, as the Ninth Circuit has noted: ""[flair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by [it].""_Lenz v. Universal
Music Corp. , 815 F.3d 1145 , 1151 (9th Cir. 2016). Hence, "" ‘anyone who ... makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer
of the copyright with respect to such use.’ "" /d. at 1152 (alterations omitted) (quoting Sony Corp._. 464 U.S. at 433 , 104 S.Ct.
774).

""Consequently, if the fair use inquiry demonstrates that [Movant] is not an infringer of Watch Tower's copyrighted works,
[then] the subpoena must be quashed."" /n re DMCA Subpoena to Reddit, Inc. , 441 F. Supp. 3d 875, 883 (N.D. Cal. 2020).
""The only authorized purpose for the subpoena under the DMCA was to discover his identity as an alleged copyright
infringer to protect Watch Tower's copyrights."" /d. (citing 15 U.S.C. § 512(h)(2)(C) (requiring ""a sworn declaration to the
effect that the purpose for which the subpoena is sought is to obtain the identity of an alleged infringer and that such
information will only be used for the purpose of protecting rights under this title"")). Simply put, ""[i]f [Movant] establishes that
he made fair use of the copyrighted works, no claim of copyright infringement could plausibly be alleged against him, and
the subpoena would not be authorized under the DMCA."" /d.

Accordingly, the Court readily rejects Watch Tower's argument that it should not address fair use at this stage based ona
""factually deficient record."" To begin, Watch Tower neither disputes the authenticity of the copies of its works nor of the
Dubtown Video currently before the Court. See Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Dev. Corp. , 602 F.3d 57 , 64 (2d
Cir. 2010) (""In copyright infringement actions, the works themselves supersede and control contrary descriptions of them,
including any contrary allegations, conclusions or descriptions of the works contained in the pleadings."" (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted)); accord Hughes v. Benjamin , 437 F. Supp. 3d 382, 389 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (dismissing complaint
pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) based on fair use defense after conducting a side-by-side analysis of the two works attached to
the complaint).

And while it attempts to raise purported factual disputes in the record ( i.e. , how Movant obtained Watch Tower's works and
whether he monetized the Dubtown Video on YouTube ( see Resp. in Opp'n at 18), Watch Tower ignores that Movant
submitted declarations in which he effectively agrees with it on the facts or clarifies the record. ( Compare Resp. in Opp'n at
12 (""[Movant] avers he obtained all portions of [Watch Tower's works] that he reproduced in the [Dubtown] Video from a
third-party video posted on YouTube on April 4, 2018 by ""John Cedars"" .... However, this claim is demonstrably false.
Certain portions of [Watch Tower's works] that were replicated in the [Dubtown] Video ... do not appear in the Cedars
Video."" (emphasis omitted)) and id. at 18 (""Many of Movant's videos are monetized by Google Ads and [Movant] has created
a specific video touting Google Ads and soliciting contributions to his videos."") with John Doe Decl. 4.5, ECF No. 22
(""Watchtower is correct that | did not directly obtain the Watchtower footage in my video from the John Cedars’ video itself. |
obtained the footage from John Cedars’ production team (for a higher picture quality) shortly before the release of the John
Cedars video."") and id. ¥ 8 (""For the period from February 21, 2018 through June 19, 2018, my channel was not monetised
due to a Youtube policy that required certain minimum viewership for monetisation. | did not meet those requirements until
June 19, 2018. By the time | started monetising my channel, the [Dubtown Video] had already been taken down.""); see also
ECF No. 6

[581 F.Supp.3d 519]

(pre-motion letter dated Aug. 22, 2018) (stating that Movant ""obtained the allegedly infringing footage through another
YouTube user ... who leaked the JW Video prior to its official release."")). Besides, Watch Tower fails to argue that these
declarations are inadmissible, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4) (regarding the admissibility of declarations at the summary
judgment stage), or to sufficiently controvert the same.

Indeed, the Court finds Watch Tower's position surprising ""given that Watch Tower was required to evaluate fair use before
sending its take-down notice to [YouTube] ..., and that Watch Tower and its attorney represented they had done the samef[.]""
In re DMCA Subpoena to Reddit, Inc. , 441 F. Supp. 3d at 886 (citing Lenz, 815 F.3d at 1153 ) (holding that ""a copyright
holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)""); ( see also ECF No. 1-
3 (""I have a good faith belief that use of the materials in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,
its agent, or the law.). As such, Watch Tower is ""not well situated to say now that the inquiry should wait."" In re DMCA
Subpoena to Reddit, Inc. , 441 F. Supp. 3d at 886 (noting that Watch Tower made the same argument in opposing a similar
motion to quash). The Court now proceeds to determine whether Movant made fair use of the works here.

In undertaking a fair use analysis, the Court considers the following non-exhaustive list of factors set forth in 17 U.S.C. § 107


--- Page 5 ---
(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

As the Second Circuit has explained, ""the four listed statutory factors in § 107 guide but do not control [the] fair use analysis
and ‘are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.""_Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v.
Carol Publ'g Grp.. Inc. , 150 F.3d 132 , 141 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. 510 U.S. 569 , 577—
78, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ). The ultimate question is ""whether the copyright law's goal of ‘promoting the
Progress of Science and useful Arts’ ... would be better served by allowing the use than by preventing it.""_Cariou v. Prince
714 F.3d 694 , 705 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Castle Rock Entm't, 150 F.3d at 141 ).

A. Purpose and Character of Use

The first factor in the fair use inquiry is ""the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). The focus of this analysis asks ""whether the new work
merely supersedes the objects of the original creation or instead adds something new."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 579 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotations omitted). The more ""transformative"" the new work, the less the significance of the factors that
weigh against fair use, such as use of a commercial nature. /d. ; accord Blanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d 244 , 254 (2d Cir. 2006) ;
Yang v. Mic Network, Inc. , 405 F. Supp. 3d 537, 546 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).

Here, neither party disputes that Movant used Watch Tower's works in the Dubtown Video to criticize, satirize, and comment
on the practices of Jehovah's Witnesses, a manner that is fundamentally at odds with Watch Tower's original purpose for its
videos—to support the work of

[581 F.Supp.3d 520]

Jehovah's Witnesses. ( Compare Seymour Decl. 7, 8, 11 with Polidoro Decl. § 3); see also 17 U.S.C. § 107 (expressly
permitting fair use for the purposes of criticism and comment). ""Moreover, the critical nature of [the Dubtown Video] is
apparent from the broader context of [Movant's] YouTube Channel, where it was posted."" Hughes , 437 F. Supp. 3d at 391
(citing BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, LLC , 87 F. Supp. 3d 499, 507 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (finding the use of copied
photographs transformative based on the surrounding context in which they were published)). In fact, Movant's other videos
in his YouTube channel, like the Dubtown Video, all involve stop-frame Lego animations with titles that are derisive about
the practices of Jehovah's Witnesses. ( See Seymour Decl. ¥ 8, Ex. 5.)

It is well-established that ""[a]mong the best recognized justifications for copying from another's work is to provide comment
on it or criticism of it."" Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 215 (2d Cir. 2015), cert. denied sub nom. The Authors
Guild v. Google. Inc. , 578 U.S. 941 , 136 S. Ct. 1658 , 194 L.Ed.2d 800 (2016) . Indeed, the Second Circuit has held ""there
is a strong presumption that factor one favors the defendant if the allegedly infringing work fits the description of uses
described in section 107,"" including ""criticism"" and ""comment."" Wright v. Warner Books, Inc. , 953 F.2d 731 , 736 (2d Cir.
1991) ; see also TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168 , 179 (2d Cir. 2016) (""[T]he uses identified by Congress in
the preamble to § 107—criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research—might be deemed ‘most
appropriate’ for a purpose or character finding indicative of fair use.""); NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst. , 364 F.3d 471 , 477 (2d
Cir. 2004) (""Where the defendants’ use is for the purposes of criticism [or] comment ... factor one will normally tilt in the
defendants’ favor."") (internal quotation omitted).

But Watch Tower argues that the Dubtown Video is not transformative because it either displays unedited segments of its
original works without much criticism or commentary, or merely ridicules its content by, for example, pointing out the
presence of a green screen in the background for special effects or juxtaposing other sound recordings. (Resp. in Opp'n at
24.) While it is true that the Dubtown Video displays certain excerpts from Watch Tower's works in their original and
unaltered states, physical changes are not required for a new use to be transformative. See, e.g. _ Katz v. Google, Inc. , 802
F.3d 1178 , 1183 (11th Cir. 2015) ("" ‘The use of a copyrighted work need not alter or augment the work to be transformative
in nature.’ "") (quoting A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye v. iParadigms , LLC, 562 F.3d 630 , 639 (4th Cir. 2009) ); Seltzer v. Green Day.
Inc. . 725 F.3d 1170 , 1177 (9th Cir. 2013) (work can be transformative with few physical changes to or comments on the
original). ""What matters is that [Movant] used the [works] to express ‘something new, with a further purpose or different
character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.’"" /n re DMCA Subpoena to Reddit, Inc. , 441 F.
Supp. 3d at 883 (quoting Campbell__510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). Needless to say, ""a reasonable observer ... would
quickly grasp [the Dubtown Video's] critical purpose."" Hughe s, 437 F. Supp. 3d at 392.

However, regarding whether Movant created the Dubtown Video for commercial purposes, the Court agrees with Watch
Tower that such use was commercial. While it is true that Movant asked for donations and did not monetize his channel at
the time he posted the Dubtown Video ( see Doe Decl. 4 8-9), the record also


--- Page 6 ---
[581 F.Supp.3d 521]

shows that Movant conceded to starting monetizing his channel on June 19, 2018 ( id. § 8) and that he promotes products,
such as t-shirts and coffee mugs, among other accessories, as part of a profit-making business ( see Polidoro Decl., Ex. E,
ECF No. 20-5). In other words, the record shows that Movant has been seeking to increase the viewership of his YouTube
channel by posting videos that criticize and comment on the practices of Jehovah's Witnesses (like the Dubtown Video) to
satisfy YouTube's viewership requirements for monetization, as well to market his accessories online. See, e.g. , Northland
Family Planning Clinic, Inc. v. Ctr. for Bio-Ethical Reform , 868 F. Supp. 2d 962 , 979 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (holding that ""
[glenerating traffic to one's website ... using copyrighted material is within the type of ‘profit’ contemplated"" by the first fair
use factor); Nunez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp. , 235 F.3d 18 , 22 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that website's use of copyrighted
photographs was commercial in nature because they ""were used in part to create an enticing lead page that would prompt
readers to purchase the newspaper.""). Thus, this sub-factor counts against a finding of fair use. However, because the use
of Watch Tower's works was transformative, this sub-factor is of ""less significance."" Blanch_, 467 F.3d at 254 .

But the inquiry into the first factor does not end there. The Second Circuit has recognized that courts must also consider ""the
propriety of a defendant's conduct"" as an additional sub-factor. See NX/VM_, 364 F.3d at 478 (citations omitted). Here, there
is no dispute that Movant obtained copies of Watch Tower's works from another YouTube user ""who leaked the JW video
prior to its official release."" (Reply at 11.) ""Thus, to the extent that [Movant] ... knew that his access to the [copies] was
unauthorized or was derived from a violation of law or breach of duty, this consideration weighs in favor of [Watch Tower].""
NXIVM_, 364 F.3d at 478 .

At any rate, the Second Circuit has previously held that ""a finding of bad faith is not to be weighed very heavily within the
first fair use factor and cannot be made central to fair use analysis."" /d. at 479 n. 2. In fact, based on the record before it, the
""pad faith"" finding here deserves little to no weight. First, Watch Tower made its works freely available for download and
redistribution from its website, which ultimately implies that Movant could have acquired the copyrighted works legitimately
and free of cost. See id. at 478 (noting that ""it has been considered relevant within [the subfactor of ‘bad faith’] that a
defendant could have acquired the copyrighted manuscript legitimately""). And second, Movant did not knowingly acquire the
unauthorized copies ""for the very purpose of preempting [Watch Tower's] first publication rights"" or with the intention to
supplant Watch Tower's ""commercially valuable right of first publication."" /d. at 478-79. Instead, as already discussed above,
Movant's use of Watch Tower's works ""was quite plainly critical and transformative."" /d. at 479.

Therefore, in weighing the different sub-factors with the Dubtown Video's transformative nature, the Court concludes that
the first factor moderately weighs in favor of fair use.

B. Nature of Copyrighted Work

The second fair use factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, ""calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core
of intended copyright protection than others,"" like works intended for ""creative expression for public dissemination.""
Campbell_ 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Applying this factor, courts consider ""(1) whether the [copyrighted] work is
expressive or creative, ... with a greater

[581 F.Supp.3d 522]

leeway being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work is factual or informational, and (2) whether the work is published
or unpublished, with the scope for fair use involving unpublished works being considerably narrower."" Blanch__467 F.3d at
256 (quotations omitted). The second fair use factor, however, ""may be of limited usefulness where the creative work of art
is being used for a transformative purpose."" Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. , 448 F.3d 605 , 612 (2d Cir.
2006) ; see also Campbell__510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (explaining that the nature of the copyrighted work is ""not
much help ... in separating the fair use sheep from the infringing goats in a parody case, since parodies almost invariably
copy publicly known, expressive works"").

Here, the second fair use factor weighs slightly against fair use. As for the first Blanch consideration, Watch Tower's works
are ""factual or informational"" in that they are mostly religious, educational, and informational in nature, but they also have
some ""expressive or creative"" value in its performances and production. Blanch__467 F.3d at 256 (internal quotation marks
omitted). With respect to the second Blanch consideration, it is undisputed that all of Watch Tower's works were unpublished
at the time Movant used them to create the Dubtown Video, which weighs slightly against fair use. /d. (internal quotation
marks omitted). Hence, in weighing the Blanch considerations, the second fair use factor weighs slightly against Movant.

C. Amount and Substantiality Used

The third statutory fair use factor turns on ""whether ‘the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole’ ... [is] reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 107). In assessing this factor, the Court considers ""not only ‘the quantity of the materials
used’ but also ‘their quality and importance.’ "" TCA Television__839 F.3d at 185 (quoting Campbell__510 U.S. at 587 ,114
S.Ct. 1164 ). ""The crux of the inquiry is whether ‘no more [content] was taken than necessary,’ "" given the purpose and
character of the allegedly infringing use. Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust , 755 F.3d 87 , 98 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Campbell



--- Page 7 ---
510 U.S. at 589 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ); see also Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 613 (""[T]he third-factor inquiry must take
into account that ... the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use."" (internal quotation
marks omitted)). Thus, the third factor may favor the alleged infringer even where he copies an entire work, provided that
such copying was reasonably necessary in relation to the work's transformative purpose. See, e.g. , Authors Guild__755 F.3d
at 98 -99 ; see also, e.g. , Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. , 756 F.3d 73 , 90 (2d Cir. 2014) (concluding
hat the third fair use factor was neutral where an entire work was copied).

Here, the thirteen-minute Dubtown Video uses different percentages of Watch Tower's works, some more substantially than
others. However, when considering that four of Watch Tower's works amount to around thirty-two minutes and a half and the
JW Video (a compilation of those four with additional footage) amounts to around fifty-three minutes, together with the fact
hat the Dubtown Video uses such excepts solely to parody, criticize, and comment, the Court concludes that the third factor
avors fair use. See Hosseinzadeh v. Klein , 276 F. Supp. 3d 34, 46 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (where intent of new work was to
critique and parody the original, new work's use of 60 percent of video footage from original was fair). Also, Movant
interjects, superimposes, and overdubs

581 F.Supp.3d 523]

parodic commentary and music over the excerpted footage, which further weighs in his favor. See, e.g. , Blanch, 467 F. 3d at
248 , 257-58 (doctoring of original photograph decreased substantiality of use); NX/VM__364 F.3d at 481 (portion of original
worked used was not excessive because all excerpted portions were relevant to defendants’ analysis and critical
commentary); Yang , 405 F. Supp. 3d at 546-47 (cropping of photograph weighed in favor of defendant on fair use inquiry).

D. Effect of the Use Upon the Potential Market

Finally, the fourth fair use factor concerns ""whether the secondary use usurps the market of the original work."" Blanch__467
F.3d at 258 (quoting NX/VM_, 364 F.3d at 482 ). An infringer usurps the original work's market when his ""target audience and
the nature of the infringing content is the same as the original."" Cariou._714 F.3d at 709 . Thus, ""[t]he more transformative
the secondary use, the less [the] likelihood that the secondary use substitutes for the original."" Castle Rock Entm't_150 F.3d
at 145.

Here, the record shows that there is no danger that the Dubtown Video will usurp the market for which Watch Tower intends
its works. If anything, the record shows that the transformative nature of the Dubtown Video—namely, to criticize, satirize,
and comment on the practices of Jehovah's Witnesses—is clearly not the same as Watch Tower's target audience. See
Cariou__714 F.3d at 709 . ""Moreover, although [the Dubtown Video] is comprised entirely of portions of [Watch Tower's
works], there is no reason to think that [Watch Tower's] audience will abandon [the JW website] to watch the derisively-titled
[""DUBTOWN -— Family Worship July Broadcast""] on a [stop-frame Lego animation] YouTube channel simply because it
contains parts of [its] work[s]."" Hughes , 437 F. Supp. 3d at 394. Thus, the fourth fair use factor strongly favors Movant.

Overall, three of the four statutory fair use factors favor Movant, including the most important factor (purpose and character
of use), while the least important factor (nature of the copyrighted work) only weighs slightly against Movant. Therefore, the
record establishes that Movant made fair use of Watch Tower's works. Consequently, Movant did not infringe Watch

Tower's copyrighted works, and there is no basis under the DMCA for a subpoena to compel disclosure of his identity. ""This

is not a matter of limiting disclosure to outside counsel only, but that disclosure is not permitted at all under the law."" /n re
DMCA Subpoena to Reddit, Inc. , 441 F. Supp. 3d at 887. Accordingly, the motion to quash is granted.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Movant's motion to quash the June 19, 2018 subpoena issued under the
above-captioned case.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
LAURA TAYLOR SWAIN, United States District Judge

Solid Oak Sketches, LLC (""Solid Oak"" or ""Plaintiff""), brings this action against Defendants 2K Games, Inc., and Take-Two
Interactive Software, Inc. (collectively, ""Take Two"" or ""Defendants""), asserting a claim of copyright infringement pursuant to
the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq. (the ""Copyright Act""). Following this Court's granting of Defendants’
motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for statutory damages and attorneys' fees on August 2, 2016, Plaintiff filed a Second
Amended Complaint (""SAC"") on October 24, 2016. (Docket Entry No. 55.) On August 16, 2016, Defendants filed
counterclaims for declaratory judgment pursuant to the Copyright Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201
- 2202 (""Def. Countercl.""). (Docket Entry No. 47.) The Court denied Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the counterclaims on May
16, 2017 (docket entry no. 64) and, on March 30, 2018, denied Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings (""March
Op.,"" docket entry no. 117).

[449 F.Supp.3d 339]
The Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1338.

Defendants now move for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, requesting (i) an order
dismissing Plaintiff's copyright infringement claim and (ii) entry of declaratory judgment in Defendants’ favor on their de
minimis use and fair use counterclaims. 1 (Docket Entry No. 127.) Plaintiff has cross moved to exclude the four expert
declarations filed in support of Defendants' summary judgment motion. (Docket Entry No. 147.) The Court has considered
carefully the parties’ submissions in connection with the motions. For the following reasons, Defendants' motion for summary
judgment is granted and Plaintiff's cross motion to exclude is denied.

BACKGROUND

Familiarity with the facts underlying this case, which have been detailed in prior decisions of the Court, including the August
2, 2016, Memorandum Opinion and Order, the May 16, 2017, Memorandum Order, and the March 30, 2018, Memorandum
Opinion and Order, is presumed. (See Docket Entry Nos. 44, 64, and 117.) The following summary focuses on facts that
are pertinent to the question of whether Defendants are entitled to summary judgment. Except as otherwise noted, the
following material facts are undisputed. 2

Take-Two is a major developer, publisher, and marketer of interactive entertainment and video games that develops and
publishes products through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, 2K and Rockstar Games. (SAC §§ 17-18.) Defendants annually
release an updated basketball simulation video game that depicts basketball with realistic renderings of different National
Basketball Association (""NBA"") teams, including lifelike depictions of NBA players and their tattoos. (Def. Countercl. {{ 8,
141.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have infringed its copyrights by publicly displaying works for which Plaintiff owns
copyrights—five tattoos (the ""Tattoos"") that are depicted on NBA players Eric Bledsoe, LeBron James, and Kenyon Martin
(the ""Players"")—in versions 2K14, 2K15, and 2K16 (released in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively) of Defendants’
basketball simulation video game. (SAC §§ 9-11.)

Tattoos

According to Defendants’ expert, Nina Jablonski, ""[t]attoos have been a part of human expression for thousands of years.""
(Def. 56.1 § 1.) In modern day, tattoos like the Tattoos at issue in this litigation ""reflect the personal expression of the person

[449 F.Supp.3d 340]

bearing the tattoo and are created for that purpose."" (Def. 56.1 4 2-3.) The Tattoos reflect the Players' personal expression.
(Def. 56.1 4 3.)


--- Page 2 ---
Solid Oak holds an exclusive license to each of the Tattoos. (See Declaration in Opposition to Defendants' Motion and in
Support of Cross-Motion (""Haberman Decl.""), Docket Entry No. 149.) However, Solid Oak is not licensed to apply the tattoos
to a person's skin, and Solid Oak does not hold any publicity or trademark rights to the Players’ likenesses. (Def. 56.1 9
101-02.) The Players ""have given the NBA the right to license [their] likeness to third-parties,"" and the NBA has granted
such a license to Take-Two. (Def. 56.1 §/ 103-04.) The Players also granted Take-Two permission to use their likenesses.
(Declaration of LeBron James (""James Decl.""), Docket Entry No. 134, 4 13; Declaration of Kenyon Martin (""Martin Decl.""),
Docket Entry No. 135, 4 15.)

Child Portrait Tattoo

LeBron James's ""Child Portrait"" tattoo was inked by tattooist Justin Wright, and was copied from a baby picture provided by
Mr. James. (Def. 56.1 § 5-10.) Mr. Wright ""knew and intended that when [Mr. James] appeared in public, on television, in
commercials, or in other forms of media, he would display the Child Portrait Tattoo."" (Def. 56.1 4 11.) It was Mr. Wright's
intention that the ""Child Portrait"" Tattoo ""become a part of Mr. James's likeness,"" which, according to Mr. Wright, ""Mr. James
was and is free to use ... as he desire[d], including allowing others to depict it, such as in advertisements and video games.""
(Def. 56.1 94 11-13.)

330 and Flames Tattoo

LeBron James's ""330 and Flames"" tattoo was inked by tattooist Deshawn Morris, also known as Shawn Rome (Mr. Rome"").
(Def. 56.1 9 14-15.) At Mr. James's request, Mr. Rome created the tattoo by shading in the outline of, and adding flames
to, the number ""330,"" which had already been inked on Mr. James's arm. (Def. 56.1 4 16-19.) The number ""330""
represents the area code of Akron, Ohio. (Def. 56.1 § 16.) According to Defendants' expert, Dr. Nina Jablonski, flames are a
common motif used for tattoos. (Def. 56.1 { 20.)

Mr. Rome stated that, ""[aJt the time that [he] inked [the ‘330 and Flames’ tattoo] on Mr. James, [he] knew that Mr. James
was a professional basketball player with the [NBA],"" and that ""it was likely that Mr. James was going to appear in public, on
television, in commercials, or in other forms of media, like video games."" (Declaration of Deshawn Morris (""Morris Decl.""),
Docket Entry No. 132, 4 9.) Mr. Rome also stated that, ""[w]hen [he] inked [the ‘330 and Flames’ tattoo] on Mr. James
according to his requests, [he] knew and intended that [Mr. James] would display [the ‘330 and Flames’ tattoo] whenever he
appeared in public,"" and that he ""intended that [the ‘330 and Flames’ tattoo] become a part of Mr. James's likeness and part
of his image."" (Morris Decl. § 10.)

Script with a Scroll, Clouds and Doves Tattoo

Shawn Rome also inked LeBron James's ""Script with a Scroll, Clouds and Doves"" tattoo. (Def. 56.1 § 21.) The ""Script"" tattoo
was copied from a design in Mr. Rome's sketchbook. (Def. 56.1 4 22.) Solid Oak did not license the drawing used to create
the ""Script"" tattoo. (Def. 56.1 § 23.) According to Dr. Jablonski, birds, such as doves, ""have been a popular subject of tattoos
since ancient times."" (Def. 56.1 § 24.)

As with the ""330 and Flames"" tattoo, Mr. Rome ""intended that [the ‘Script’ tattoo] become a part of Mr. James's likeness and
part of his image,"" knowing that (i) Mr. James was a professional basketball

[449 F.Supp.3d 341]

player with the NBA and that (ii) it was ""likely that Mr. James was going to appear in public, on television, in commercials, or
in other forms of media, like video games."" (Morris Decl. {{ 9-10.)

Wizard Tattoo

Kenyon Martin's ""Wizard"" tattoo was inked by Thomas Ray Cornett, and was ""copied ... directly from the pre-existing design""
that Mr. Martin chose from designs featured on the walls and in books at Mr. Cornett's parlor. (Def. 56.1 9 25, 27-28.) Mr.
Cornett did not design the tattoo. (Declaration of Thomas Ray Cornett (""Cornett Decl.""), Docket Entry No. 131, § 13.) The
""Wizard"" tattoo appears as a grim reaper holding a basketball. (Def. 56.1 § 26.) Both basketballs and ""depictions of death or
the grim reaper"" are common tattoo motifs. (Def. 56.1 §§ 30-31.)

When he inked the ""Wizard"" tattoo, Mr. Cornett ""knew and intended"" that the tattoo ""would be displayed if Mr. Martin
appeared in media, such as on television or in commercials."" (Cornett Decl. § 15.) Mr. Cornett ""also intended that the tattoo
become a part of Mr. Martin's likeness and part of his image."" (Id. ) Further, Mr. Cornett ""knew and intended that the tattoo
would need to be included if anyone were to create a rendition of Mr. Martin's likeness, such as in art or video games."" (Id. )

Basketball with Stars and Script

Mr. Cornett also inked Eric Bledsoe's ""Basketball with Stars and Script"" tattoo. (Cornett Decl. 20.) This tattoo was
designed by Mr. Cornett with Mr. Bledsoe's direction and input. (Id. ) When Mr. Cornett inked the ""Basketball with Stars and
Script"" tattoo on Mr. Bledsoe, he ""knew and intended that [Mr. Bledsoe] would display the tattoo whenever he appeared in
public,"" such as ""on television or in commercials."" (ld. § 21.) As with Mr. Kenyon's ""Wizard"" tattoo, Mr. Cornett ""intended
that the [‘Basketball with Stars and Script’] tattoo [would] become a part of Mr. Bledsoe's likeness and part of his image,"" and
he ""knew and intended that the tattoo would need to be included if anyone were to create a rendition of Mr. Bledsoe's
likeness, such as in art or video games."" (Id. )


--- Page 3 ---
NBA 2K Video Game

The NBA 2K game, which is much shorter in duration than an actual NBA game, has ""many components, including graphics,
characters, a fictitious plot, gameplay, [and] music."" (Def. 56.1 70, 72.) These components, which include auditory
elements such as ""the sound of shoes against the court's surface; the noise of the crowd, the horns and other audible
warnings signaling elapsing shot clocks, ending timeouts, ... television announcers performing play-by-play,"" and visual
elements such as ""the basketball; the hoop, ... the court, ... the players, including multiple individuals on the court and on the
sidelines, each of whom wears jerseys with different accessories and other features (such as tattoos); coaches; referees;
cheerleaders; spectators; the stadium; and the game clock and scoring system,"" are designed to most accurately simulate
the look and feel of an actual NBA game. (Def. 56.1 9 74, 93; see also Declaration of Jeffrey Thomas in Support of
Defendants-Counterclaimants' Motion for Summary Judgment (""Thomas Decl.""), Docket Entry No. 130, § 2.)

To further the goal of simulating an actual NBA game, Take-Two included the Tattoos in NBA 2K ""to accurately depict the
physical likenesses of the real-world basketball players as realistically as possible."" (Def. 56.1 § 79.) However, for a number
of reasons, NBA 2K users do not see the Tattoos clearly, if at all, during gameplay. (Def. 56.1 4 91-99.) NBA 2K does not
depict the Tattoos separately from the

449 F.Supp.3d 342]

Players. (Def. 56.1 § 85.) Therefore, the Tattoos only appear when a user selects Mr. James, Mr. Martin, or Mr. Bledsoe
rom over 400 available players. (Def. 56.1 §{/ 85-86.) The Tattoos comprise only a miniscule proportion of the video game
data: only 0.000286% to 0.000431% of the NBA 2K game data is devoted to the Tattoos. (Def. 56.1 75-78.)

When a Tattooed player is selected, the Tattoos are depicted on a computer or television screen at about 4.4% to 10.96% of
he size that they appear in real life ""due to the great distance from the camera that the players usually are depicted"" and

he resulting relatively small size of the player figures. (Def. 56.1 4 91-92; Expert Report and Declaration of lan Bogost,
Ph.D. (""Bogost Decl.""), Docket Entry No. 136, 9 71-77.) The Tattoos appear merely as ""visual noise,"" ""no more noticeable
han a simulated player's nose shape or hairstyle."" (Def. 56.1 § 94-95 (internal quotation marks omitted).) The Tattoos ""are
subordinated to the display of the court and the players in competition."" (Def. 56.1 4 96 (internal quotation marks omitted).)
The Tattoos also cannot be observed clearly because they are often ""blocked from view by other players,"" are ""obstruct[ed]
by other game elements,"" ""often appear out-of-focus,"" and ""players on whom the Tattoos appear move quickly in the game.""
(Def. 56.1 § 97 (internal quotation marks omitted).)

Defendants provided video clips showing how each of the Players appears during NBA 2K gameplay. (Thomas Decl., Exs.
B, C, and D.) At no point during the video clips are the Tattoos discernible to the viewer. These videos demonstrate that the
Players' tattoos, including the Tattoos at issue, appear entirely out-of-focus. The Tattoos are further obscured by the
Players' quick and erratic movements up and down the basketball court. (Thomas Decl., Exs. B, C, and D.)

The Tattoos did not play a significant role in marketing NBA 2K. The NBA 2K game covers do not depict the Players or their
tattoos, and the advertising materials neither depicted nor discussed the Tattoos. (See Def. Countercl. {{ 161-67; Plaintiff's
Answer to Defendants' Counterclaims (""PI. Ans.""), Docket Entry No. 65, {| 161-67.) According to Defendants’ expert, Dr.
Jay, while ""consumers buy NBA 2K video games for numerous reasons ... consumers do not buy NBA 2K video games for
the tattoos on LeBron James, Eric Bledsoe or Kenyon Martin."" (Def. 56.1 4 90.)

Market for Licensing Tattoos

Solid Oak has not profited from licensing the Tattoos. (Declaration of Dale M. Cendali, Esq. in Support of Defendants-
Counterclaimants' Motion for Summary Judgment (""Cendali Decl.""), Docket Entry No. 140, Ex. E at 370.) Solid Oak has
never created a video game that depicts the Tattoos, nor has Solid Oak licensed the Tattoos for use in a video game. (Def.
56.1 J 105-06, 110.) Defendants’ expert, Dr. Bogost, stated that he is ""not familiar with any video game developer licensing
the rights to tattoos for inclusion in a video game."" (Def. 56.1 § 111.) Solid Oak has not identified an instance in which a
tattoo image has been licensed for use in a video game. (Def. 56.1 § 112.) Defendants’ expert, James Malackowski, opined
that a market for licensing basketball players' tattoos for use in video games is ""unlikely to develop."" (Def. 56.1 § 115.) As
noted above, Defendants’ expert, Dr. Jay, relied on consumer survey data to conclude that ""consumers do not buy NBA 2K
video games for the tattoos on LeBron James, Eric Bledsoe or Kenyon Martin."" (Def 56.1 § 90.) Thus, there is no demand
for licensing the Tattoos for use in a video game.

[449 F.Supp.3d 343]

Solid Oak has neither licensed the Tattoo designs nor sold merchandise depicting the Tattoos. (Def. 56.1 44 107-08.) Solid
Oak's owner, Matthew Siegler, testified that he would ""need permission from the players ... to not infringe on their right of
publicity,"" in order to move forward with a business selling ""dry wick apparel"" bearing the Players’ tattoos. (Cendali Decl.,
Ex. A at 389.) Solid Oak does not have a license to use the Players’ publicity or trademark rights. (Def 56.1 § 102.) Solid
Oak has not proffered any evidence indicating that it has a prospect of obtaining such rights.

DISCUSSION

Rule 56 Summary Judgment Standard

Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment is to be granted in favor of a moving
party where that party can demonstrate ""that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to


--- Page 4 ---
judgment as a matter of law."" Fed R. Civ. P. 56(a) ; see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. _ 477 U.S. 242 , 256, 106 S.Ct.
2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) . For the purposes of summary judgment motion practice, a fact is considered material ""if it
might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,"" and an issue of fact is ""genuine"" where ""the evidence is such
that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party."" Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co. Inc. _ 258 F.3d 62 , 69 (2d
Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence
of a material fact, and the court must be able to find that, "" ‘after drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of a non-movant,
no reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of that party.’ "" Marvel Entertainment, Inc. v. Kellytoy (USA). Inc. . 769 F. Supp.
2d 520 , 523 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting Heublein v. U.S. , 996 F.2d 1455 , 1461 (2d Cir. 1993) ).

A party that is unable to ""make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case,
and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial,"" will not survive a Rule 56 motion. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477
U.S. 317 , 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . Specifically, the party who bears the burden of proof at trial ""must
do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts and they may not rely on
conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation."" Jeffreys v. N.Y.C. , 426 F.3d 549 , 554 (2d Cir. 2005) (citations
omitted). ""[MJere conclusory allegations or denials ... cannot by themselves create a genuine issue of material fact where
none would otherwise exist."" Hicks v. Baines , 593 F.3d 159, 166 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted).

Plaintiff's Copyright Infringement Claim

Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for copyright infringement, arguing that Plaintiff cannot prove its claim
because Defendants’ use of the Tattoos is de minimis and Plaintiff is thus unable to prove the key substantial similarity
element of its cause of action. Defendants further argue that the copyright claim must fail because their use of the images
was pursuant to implied authorization granted prior to Plaintiff's acquisition of any rights in the Tattoos.

De Minimis Use
""In order to establish a claim of copyright infringement, a plaintiff with a valid copyright must demonstrate that: (1) the

defendant has actually copied the plaintiff's work; and (2) the copying is illegal because a substantial similarity exists
between the defendant's work and the protectible elements of plaintiff's.""

[449 F.Supp.3d 344]

Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Dev. Corp. . 602 F.3d 57 , 63 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).
To be substantially similar, the amount copied must be more than de minimis . Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Grp
Inc. , 150 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing Ringgold v. Black Entertainment Television, Inc. . 126 F.3d 70 , 75 (2d Cir.
1997) ). ""To establish that the infringement of a copyright is de minimis , and therefore not actionable, the alleged infringer
must demonstrate that the copying of the protected material is so trivial ‘as to fall below the quantitative threshold of
substantial similarity, which is always a required element of actionable copying.’ ""Sandoval v. New Line Cinema Corp. , 147
F.3d 215 , 217 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Ringgold , 126 F.3d at 74 ).

The quantitative component of a de minimis analysis concerns (i) ""the amount of the copyrighted work that is copied,"" (ii)
""the observability of the copied work — the length of time the copied work is observable in the allegedly infringing work,"" and
(iii) factors such as ""focus, lighting, camera angles, and prominence."" Ringgold , 126 F.3d at 75 (citing 4 Melville B. Nimmer
& David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §§ 13.03[A][2] (1997)). ""[O]bservability of the copyrighted work in the allegedly
infringing work"" is fundamental to a determination of whether the ""quantitative threshold"" of substantial similarity has been
crossed. Sandoval , 147 F.3d at 217.

Substantial similarity must be determined through application of the ""ordinary observer test,"" which considers ""whether an
average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work."" Rogers v.
Koons , 960 F.2d 301 , 307 (2d Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the Court considers ""whether
the ordinary observer, unless he set out to detect the disparities, would be disposed to overlook them, and regard their
aesthetic appeal as the same."" Id. at 307-08 (internal quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment may be granted on a de
minimis use claim when ""no reasonable trier of fact could find the works substantially similar."" Estate of Smith v. Cash
Money Records, Inc. , 253 F. Supp. 3d 737, 746 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).

As noted above, Defendants assert that Plaintiff cannot establish substantial similarity because their use of the Tattoos is de
minimis . (See Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants-Counterclaimants 2K Games, Inc. and Take-Two Interactive
Software, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (""Def. Opening Br.""), Docket Entry No. 128, at 9-11.) Plaintiff protests that
""Defendants have provided no material extrinsic evidence that answers the material questions surrounding de minimis use.""
(Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and in Support of Plaintiff's Cross-Motion
(""PI. Opp. Br.""), Docket Entry No. 148, at 3-7.)

In resisting Defendants' earlier motion for judgment on the pleadings, Plaintiff had argued that, ""if an NBA2K player selects
Messrs. James, Martin and Bledsoe in a given game or series of games, or ‘employs the broad range of the video game's
features to focus, angle the camera on, or make the subject tattoos more prominent,’ ‘the overall observability of the subject
tattoos can be fairly significant.’ "" (March Op. at 7-8.) The Court denied the motion, holding, inter alia , that, at the pleading
stage,

there [was] no objective perspective as to how the Defendants’ video game is generally played, or to what extent


--- Page 5 ---
certain game features can be or are actually utilized, that would allow this Court to
[449 F.Supp.3d 345]

make determinations about the choices and subsequent observations of the ‘average lay observer,’ or about the
observability and prominence of the Tattoos. The Court [was] thus unable to conclude without the aid of extrinsic
evidence that ‘no reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the two works are substantially similar.’

(March Op. at 8.)

Here, Defendants are entitled as a matter of law to summary judgment dismissing Plaintiff's copyright infringement claim
because no reasonable trier of fact could find the Tattoos as they appear in NBA 2K to be substantially similar to the Tattoo
designs licensed to Solid Oak. The Tattoos only appear on the players upon whom they are inked, which is just three out of
over 400 available players. The undisputed factual record shows that average game play is unlikely to include the players
with the Tattoos and that, even when such players are included, the display of the Tattoos is small and indistinct, appearing
as rapidly moving visual features of rapidly moving figures in groups of player figures. Furthermore, the Tattoos are not
featured on any of the game's marketing materials.

When the Tattoos do appear during gameplay (because one of the Players has been selected), the Tattoos cannot be
identified or observed. (Thomas Decl., Exs. B, C, and D.) The Tattoos are significantly reduced in size: they are a mere
4.4% to 10.96% of the size that they appear in real life. The video clips proffered by Defendants show that the Tattoos ""are
not displayed [in NBA 2K] with sufficient detail for the average lay observer to identify even the subject matter of the
[Tattoos], much less the style used in creating them."" Sandoval , 147 F.3d at 218 . The videos demonstrate that the Tattoos
appear out of focus and are observable only as undefined dark shading on the Players' arms. Further, the Players’ quick
and erratic movements up and down the basketball court make it difficult to discern even the undefined dark shading. The
uncontroverted evidence proffered by Defendants demonstrates that the Tattoos often do not appear during the NBA 2K
video game and, when they do, they are so small and distorted by the camera angles and other game elements that they
are indiscernible to the average game users. While Plaintiff previously asserted that NBA 2K ""employs the broad range of
the video game's features to focus, angle the camera on, or make the subject tattoos more prominent"" (March Ord. at 7-8),
Plaintiff has not proffered any evidence to support that proposition. The undisputed evidence of record shows that
Defendants' use of the Tattoos in NBA 2K falls below the quantitative threshold of substantial similarity. No reasonable fact
finder could conclude that Plaintiff has carried its burden of proving that Defendants’ use of the copyrighted material was
substantially similar to Plaintiffs copyrighted work. Thus, Defendants are entitled as a matter of law to judgment dismissing
Plaintiff's SAC, which asserts only a copyright infringement claim, and a declaration that Defendants' use of the Tattoos is de
minimis .

Implied License
Defendants also argue persuasively that Plaintiff's copyright infringement claim must fail because they were authorized to
[449 F.Supp.3d 346]

use the Tattoos in NBA 2K; Defendants assert that they had an implied license to feature the Tattoos as part of the Players’
likenesses. (Def. Opening Br. at 23-25.) Plaintiff disputes this proposition, arguing that the tattooist's expectations about
whether a tattoo would become a part of his or her client's likeness ""play[ ] no role in copyright law."" (PI. Opp. Br. at 16.)
Plaintiff also asserts that ""any restriction on Plaintiff's ability to commercially exploit the underlying artwork should have been
included in the [Tattoo] licensing agreements."" (PI. Opp. Br. at 17.)

""A copyright owner who grants a nonexclusive license to use his copyrighted material waives his right to sue the licensee for
copyright infringement."" Graham v. James , 144 F.3d 229 , 236 (2d Cir. 1998). ""Although the Second Circuit has not yet
ruled on the precise circumstances under which an implied non-exclusive license will be found,"" courts in this Circuit have
found an implied non-exclusive license ""where one party created a work at the other's request and handed it over, intending
that the other copy and distribute it."" Weinstein Co. v. Smokewood Entm't Grp. , LLC, 664 F. Supp. 2d 332 , 344 (S.D.N.Y.
2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Here, the undisputed factual record clearly supports the reasonable inference that the tattooists necessarily granted the
Players nonexclusive licenses to use the Tattoos as part of their likenesses, and did so prior to any grant of rights in the
Tattoos to Plaintiff. According to the declarations of Messrs. Thomas, Cornett, and Morris, (i) the Players each requested the
creation of the Tattoos, (ii) the tattooists created the Tattoos and delivered them to the Players by inking the designs onto
their skin, and (iii) the tattooists intended the Players to copy and distribute the Tattoos as elements of their likenesses, each
knowing that the Players were likely to appear ""in public, on television, in commercials, or in other forms of media.""
(Declaration of Justin Wright (""Wright Decl.""), Docket Entry No. 133, 4 10.) Thus, the Players, who were neither requested
nor agreed to limit the display or depiction of the images tattooed onto their bodies, had implied licenses to use the Tattoos
as elements of their likenesses. Defendants' right to use the Tattoos in depicting the Players derives from these implied
licenses, which predate the licenses that Plaintiff obtained from the tattooists.

The Players ""have given the NBA the right to license their likeness to third-parties,"" and the NBA has granted such license
to Take-Two. (Def. 56.1 {103-04 (internal quotation marks omitted).) The Players also granted Take-Two permission to

use their likeness. (James Decl. 4 13; Martin Decl. 15.) Therefore, Defendants had permission to include the Tattoos on
the Players' bodies in NBA 2K because the Players had an implied license to use the Tattoos as part of their likeness, and


--- Page 6 ---
the Players either directly or indirectly granted Defendants a license to use their likenesses. Defendants are therefore
entitled as a matter of law to summary judgment dismissing Plaintiff's copyright infringement claim for this reason as well.

Fair Use Counterclaim

Defendants also seek a declaration that their use of the Tattoos in NBA 2k is fair use. (Def. Opening Br. at 11-22.) Plaintiff
argues that Defendants have failed to proffer any relevant, material evidence to ""prove fair use."" (PI. Opp. Br. at 7.) Plaintiff's
assertion is belied by the undisputed evidence of record.

The Copyright Act provides that

of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be
considered shall include —

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

""The determination of fair use is a mixed question of fact and law,"" Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Serv. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. . 756
F.3d 73 , 81 (2d Cir. 2014), and is an ""open-ended and context-sensitive inquiry.""Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244, 251 (2d
Cir. 2006). ""Although the issue of fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, the court may resolve issues of fair use at the

summary judgment stage where there are no genuine issues of material fact as to such issues."" Bill Graham Archives v.
Dorling Kindersley Ltd. , 448 F.3d 605 , 608 (2d Cir. 2006).

Purpose and Character of the Use

In evaluating the purpose and character of an allegedly infringing use, courts consider ""whether the new work merely
supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character,
altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message."" Bill Graham Archives , 448 F.3d at 608 (internal quotation
marks omitted). To that end, courts consider whether the allegedly infringing use is ""transformative,"" that is, (i) whether the
wo works have different purposes, (ii) the size of the reproductions, (iii) whether the expressive value of the reproduced
material is minimized, and (iv) the proportion of copied material. Id. at 609-11. Courts also consider whether the allegedly
infringing use is commercial in nature. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569 , 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127

L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) .

Here, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that Defendants’ use of the Tattoos is transformative. First, while NBA 2K
eatures exact copies of the Tattoo designs, its purpose in displaying the Tattoos is entirely different from the purpose for
which the Tattoos were originally created. The Tattoos were originally created as a means for the Players to express
hemselves through body art. Defendants reproduced the Tattoos in the video game in order to most accurately depict the
Players, and the particulars of the Tattoos are not observable. The uncontroverted evidence thus shows that the Tattoos
were included in NBA 2K for a purpose—general recognizability of game figures as depictions of the Players—different than
hat for which they were originally created.

Second, Defendants ""significantly reduced the size of the [Tattoos]"" in the video game. Bill Graham Archives . 448 F.3d at
611 . It is undisputed that, when comparing the size of the Tattoos as they appear in NBA 2K to the size they appear on the
Players' skin in real life, the Tattoos appear at 4.4% to 10.96% of their actual size because the player figures are themselves
proportionately smaller than in real life. This reduction in size, along with the other game elements discussed above, makes
the Tattoos more difficult to observe. Thus, NBA 2K does not ""offer more than a glimpse of [the Tattoos'] expressive value[,]
as the Tattoos are too small and distorted for game users to even recognize

[449 F.Supp.3d 348]

them in NBA 2K. See id. (finding second transformative use factor satisfied when thumbnail-sized images were ""sufficient to
permit readers to recognize the historical significance of the [works],"" but were too small to see more than ""a glimpse of [the
works'] expressive value"").

Third, the Tattoos' expressive value is minimized in NBA 2K. The Tattoo images are infrequently and only imprecisely
observable and are combined with myriad other auditory and visual elements, like the other players, referees, the sound of
shoes against the court's surface, the noise of the crowd, the horns and other audible warnings signaling elapsing shot


--- Page 7 ---
clocks, ending timeouts, television announcers performing play-by-play—elements all included to simulate an actual NBA
game. As discussed above, the uncontroverted factual record shows that the Tattoos were not included for their expressive
value, but rather to most accurately recreate certain NBA players’ likenesses.

Fourth, the Tattoos constitute an inconsequential portion of NBA 2K. As noted above, it is undisputed that they only appear

on three out of 400 available players, they comprise only 0.000286% to 0.000431% of the total game data, and they cannot
be seen clearly during gameplay. Game users can see that the Players have tattoos, but cannot identify the specific Tattoos
at issue.

Lastly, NBA 2k's purpose is commercial and, as a result, the Tattoos’ inclusion in the game is also commercial. However, as
discussed above, the Tattoos are indistinguishable during gameplay and they do not feature in any of the game's marketing
materials. Further, the Tattoo images are merely ""incidental to the commercial ... value of the [game],"" because ""consumers
do not buy NBA 2K video games for the tattoos on LeBron James, Eric Bledsoe or Kenyon Martin."" (Def 56.1 § 90.)

Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The Court must next consider the nature of the copyrighted work. This factor ""calls for recognition that some works are
closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to
establish when the former works are copied."" Blanch , 467 F.3d at 256 (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts consider
two factors in evaluating whether the copyrighted work is of the nature that is conducive to fair use: ""(1) whether the work is
expressive or creative ... or more factual, with a greater leeway being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work is factual
or informational, and (2) whether the work is published or unpublished, with the scope for fair use involving unpublished
works being considerably narrower."" Id.

The nature of the copyrighted works at issue here weighs in favor of finding fair use. First, Plaintiff concedes that the
Tattoos were previously published. (PI. Opp. Br. at 12.) Second, the Tattoo designs are more factual than expressive
because they are each based on another factual work or comprise representational renderings of common objects and
motifs that are frequently found in tattoos. The ""Child Portrait"" tattoo is factual—it is a reproduction of a photograph of Mr.
James's son, which was copied ""as closely as possible"" from the picture Mr. James provided. (Wright Decl. § 9.) The ""330
and Flames"" tattoo was created by adding flames—a common tattoo motif—to a number tattoo that Mr. James already had
on his skin. The ""Script with a Scroll"" tattoo was based on a design Mr. James selected from one of Mr. Rome's
sketchbooks. The ""Wizard"" tattoo was ""copied ... directly from the pre-existing design"" that Mr. Martin chose from a selection
of tattoo designs featured on the walls and in books

[449 F.Supp.3d 349]

in Mr. Cornett's parlor. (Def. 56.1 9 25, 27-28.) Similarly, the ""Basketball with Stars and Script"" tattoo is based on common
tattoo motifs such as basketballs and stars.

None of the tattooists stated in his declaration that the Tattoos were based on unique or expressive features. To the
contrary, the tattooists each stated that the Tattoos copied common tattoo motifs or were copied from designs and pictures
they themselves did not create. The one artist who referred to his sketchbook as a source of one design does not claim that
the scroll-words-doves image had particular creative or expressive features. Therefore, there is no evidence from which a
reasonable fact finder could conclude that the Tattoos were sufficiently ""expressive"" or ""creative"" to make this factor weigh
against a finding of fair use.

Amount and Substantiality of the Use

Next, the Court considers ""whether the secondary use employs more of the copyrighted work than is necessary, and
whether the copying was excessive in relation to any valid purposes asserted under the first factor."" Authors Guild, Inc. v.
HathiTrust_, 755 F.3d 87 , 96 (2d Cir. 2014). Copying the entire work does not necessarily weigh against fair use ""because
copying the entirety of a work is sometimes necessary to make a fair use of the image."" Bill Graham Archives . 448 F.3d at
613 (finding fair use despite entire copying where (i) whole images were necessary to portray historical artifacts and (ii)
copied images were reduced in size, such that ""the visual impact of their artistic expression [was] significantly limited"").

Here, the undisputed evidence shows that, while the Tattoos were copied in their entirety, Defendants did so in order to
effectuate the transformative purpose of creating a realistic game experience. Considering this purpose, it would have made
little sense for Defendants to copy just half or some smaller portion of the Tattoos, as it would not have served to depict
realistically the Players' likenesses. Furthermore, much like the copied images at issue in Bill Graham , the Tattoos were
reduced in size, such that ""the visual impact of their artistic expression [was] significantly limited."" Id. Unlike the images at
issue in Bill Graham , the Tattoos depicted in Defendants' game are not recognizable, reducing further the impact of their
artistic expression. Accordingly, the third factor does not weigh against fair use.

Effect on the Market

The fourth fair use factor considers the effect of the allegedly infringing work on any existing or potential market for, or value
of, the copyrighted work. This inquiry focuses on ""whether the copy brings to the marketplace a competing substitute for the
original, or its derivative, so as to deprive the rights holder of significant revenues because of the likelihood that potential
purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original."" Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 223 (2d
Cir. 2015). ""[T]he Factor Four analysis is concerned with only one type of economic injury to a copyright holder: the harm



--- Page 8 ---
that results because the secondary use serves as a substitute for the original work."" Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust_, 755
F.3d at 99 . Transformative uses do not cause actionable economic harm because ""by definition, [such uses] do not serve
as substitutes for the original work."" Id. ; see also Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d at 223 (""the more the copying is
done to achieve a purpose that differs from the purpose of the original, the less likely it is that the copy will serve as a
satisfactory substitute for the original"").

[449 F.Supp.3d 350]

Plaintiff asserts that ""Defendants diminished the commercial value of the tattoo artwork in the marketplace for licensing its
use in other works including, but not limited to, video games, apparel, and memorabilia."" (PI. Opp. Br. at 15.) However,
Defendants’ use of the Tattoos in NBA 2K is transformative: the Tattoos as featured in the video game cannot serve as
substitutes for use of the Tattoo designs in any other medium. Indeed, Plaintiff has conceded that ""NBA 2K is not a
substitute for the TATTOOS."" (Def. 56.1 4 67.) Therefore, use of the Tattoos in NBA 2K could not ""deprive the rights holder
of significant revenues"" because potential purchasers of the Tattoo designs are unlikely to ""opt to acquire the copy in
preference to the original."" Authors Guild v. Google. Inc. , 804 F.3d at 223. For this reason alone, the fourth factor does not
weigh against fair use.

Further, there is no evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that a market for licensing tattoos for use in
video games or other media is likely to develop. The Court may consider only the ""impact on potential licensing revenues for
traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets."" Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. , 756 F.3d at 91 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Plaintiff's hypothetical market for licensing tattoos in video games or other, unspecified media does not
satisfy this standard. Defendants have proffered uncontroverted evidence that such a market is unlikely to develop and that,
if it did, Plaintiff could not capitalize on such a market because the Tattoos are imprinted on the bodies of the Players and
Plaintiff is not licensed to use the Players’ publicity rights. Plaintiff has failed to proffer any evidence from which a reasonable
fact finder could conclude that a market for licensing tattoos for use in video games or other media is a ""traditional,
reasonable or likely to be developed market ]."" Id. Thus, the fourth fair use factor weighs in Defendants' favor.

Because the uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that all four factors weigh in Defendants' favor, the Court concludes that
no reasonable fact finder could determine that Defendants’ use of the Tattoos in NBA 2K was not fair use. Therefore,
Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their second counterclaim and to a declaration that their use of the
Tattoos in the challenged video game versions constitutes fair use.

Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude Expert Declarations and Opinions

Plaintiff moves to exclude the opinions of Defendants’ four experts—Dr. E. Deborah Jay, Dr. Nina Jablonski, Dr. lan Bogost,
and Mr. James E. Malackowski—offered in connection with Defendants' motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff asserts
broadly that the opinions ""do not rest on reliable foundations, are irrelevant to the case, and are nothing more than a
distraction from the material."" (PI. Opp. Br. at 19-27.)

""It is a well-accepted principle that Rule 702 embodies a liberal standard of admissibility for expert opinions."" Nimely v. City
of New York , 414 F.3d 381 , 395 (2d Cir. 2005). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 702, expert testimony should be
admitted if the expert is ""qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education"" and ""the expert's
scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a
fact in issue."" Fed. R. Evid. 702. In assessing the expert's qualifications, ""the only matter the court should be concerned with
is whether the expert's knowledge of the subject is such that his opinion will likely assist the trier of fact in arriving at the
truth.""

[449 F.Supp.3d 351]

Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. v. CIBA Vision Corp. , No. 04 Civ. 7369 (LTS), 2006 WL 2128785, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July
28, 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).

If the requirements of Rule 702 are met, ""the district court must also analyze the testimony under Rule 403 and may exclude
the testimony ‘if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or
misleading the jury.’ "" Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay, Inc. . 576 F. Supp. 2d 457 , 458 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 403 ).
Under these principles, ""expert evidence must be both relevant and reliable."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). ""In
assessing the relevance of proffered expert testimony, the Court looks to whether the testimony has any tendency to make
the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it
would be without the evidence."" Id. at 459.

Plaintiff's motion to exclude raises general, conclusory challenges to the qualifications of Defendants' experts as well as
challenges to their opinions under Federal Rules of Evidence 401 (relevance) and 403 (prejudice). As explained below,
Plaintiff's objections are unavailing. Defendants’ expert reports are sufficient to satisfy Defendants’ burden of demonstrating
that the experts’ testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, that their opinions and data are relevant to the
issues raised in Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and their probative value is not substantially outweighed by any
danger of unfair prejudice. The Court will address each expert report in turn.

Report of Dr. E. Deborah Jay

Dr. Jay's report analyzes survey data to examine why consumers purchased NBA 2K, and considers whether, and to what


--- Page 9 ---
extent, the Tattoos drove consumer demand for the game. Dr. Jay has more than 40 years of experience conducting large-
scale surveys and has been qualified as an expert in ""survey methodology"" by at least a dozen courts. Plaintiff asserts that
Dr. Jay's report is ""an irrelevant distraction from the actual material issues in this lawsuit"" and that Dr. Jay's reference to the
survey as an ""official report,"" is likely to cause the jury to afford it undue significance. (PI. Opp. Br. at 21-22.) Plaintiff does

not challenge Dr. Jay's qualifications or her survey methodology.

By examining whether Defendants profited (and, consequently, Plaintiff lost potential revenue) from the Tattoos' inclusion in
NBA 2K, Dr. Jay's report addresses questions relevant both to the ""commercial use"" factor of Defendants’ fair use claim and
to Plaintiff's potential damages. Indeed, the Court's reliance on Dr. Jay's findings in deciding Defendants' motion for
summary judgment demonstrates that her report is material to the issues involved in this case. Further, Plaintiff has failed to
demonstrate how Dr. Jay's report would be unfairly prejudicial. Plaintiff's disagreement with Defendants’ legal positions does
not render competent expert testimony consistent with those positions unfairly prejudicial. Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion to
exclude Dr. Jay's report and testimony pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 702 is denied.

Report of Dr. Nina Jablonski

In her declaration and report, Dr. Jablonski, a professor of anthropology who has been researching the evolution and
cultural meaning of human skin for 30 years and is the author of Skin: A Natural History , a book addressing the history and
meaning of tattooing in humans, as well as numerous other works relating to skin and human interactions, offered her
opinion on

[449 F.Supp.3d 352]

the use of tattoos as a means of personal expression, about customs and norms within the tattoo industry (including between
tattooist and client), and the unlikelihood that a market for licensing tattoos will develop. Plaintiff challenges Dr. Jablonski's
report on three principal grounds, arguing that: (i) Dr. Jablonski is not qualified to give an opinion on the market for licensing
tattoos because she is ""simply an anthropologist;"" (ii) her report is more prejudicial than probative; and (iii) her ""expert""
opinions should be stricken because they address topics easily evaluated by the common sense of laymen. (PI. Opp. Br. at
22-23.)

Plaintiff has proffered nothing more than ipse dixit to support its claim that Dr. Jablonski is unqualified to offer her opinions
concerning the tattoo industry. The record, by contrast, amply demonstrates Dr. Jabolonski's relevant body of knowledge.
Dr. Jablonski has spent years studying skin and tattoos, she has published over 100 peer-reviewed ""scholarly contributions""
on skin, and she currently works as an anthropology professor. Dr. Jablonski's knowledge of the tattoo industry is sufficiently
specialized to permit the Court to conclude that her opinions will likely assist the trier of fact in arriving at the truth. Thus, her
qualifications are sufficient to meet the threshold requirements of Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Nor can Dr. Jablonski's opinion be excluded on relevance grounds. Dr. Jablonski's report is relevant to questions of fair use
(namely, the Tattoo's expressive value) and whether norms in the tattoo industry support Defendants’ claim that they had an
implied license to use the Tattoos in NBA 2K. Further, Dr. Jablonski's opinions are not merely based on ""common sense,""
but rather are based on her years of study of the tattoo industry. Expert testimony is admissible where it is grounded in the
expert's ""academic and practical experience."" McCullock v. H.B. Fuller Co. , 61 F.3d 1038, 1043 (2d Cir. 1995). Finally,
Plaintiff's protest of ""prejudice"" appears to be grounded solely in Plaintiff's recognition that Dr. Jablonski's testimony supports
Defendant's case and undermines Plaintiff's conclusory and speculative arguments. Plaintiff has identified no unfair prejudice
that could outweigh the substantial probative value of Dr. Jablonski's testimony.

Therefore, Plaintiff's motion pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 702 to exclude Dr. Jablonski's expert report is
denied.

Report of Dr. lan Bogost

Dr. lan Bogost, professor of interactive computing and business, has proffered a declaration and report detailing information
and opinions concerning video game features generally and certain aspects of NBA 2K, including Defendants’ use of the
Tattoos. Dr. Bogost concluded that, by any measure, the Tattoos are an insignificant part of the video game and, thus, it
would not be reasonable to license such a fleeting use of a copyrighted image. Plaintiff challenges Dr. Bogost's report as
more prejudicial than probative. Plaintiff also asserts that Dr. Bogost is not qualified to give an opinion on the market for
licensing tattoos because he is not an economist.

Dr. Bogost's qualifications are well demonstrated. He has been recognized as a key figure in the field of video game studies
and he has authored over 200 journal publications, articles, book chapters, and conference papers on video games and
digital culture. His studies have also been included in course books. Dr. Bogost's field of study qualifies him to opine on
matters concerning video games and the market for video games. Dr. Bogost

[449 F.Supp.3d 353]

need not be a trained economist to offer his opinions on factors affecting the market for video games; ""[t]he law does not
require such a narrow specialty as [Plaintiff] suggest[s]."" Tiffany (NJ) Inc. _576 F. Supp. 2d at 459 . Studies concerning the
market for licensing certain copyrights for use in video games are well within Dr. Bogost's expertise. His report and
conclusions are probative of material elements of Plaintiff's claims and, as with its objection to Dr. Jablonski's report, Plaintiff
has identified no unfair prejudice.



--- Page 10 ---
Therefore, Plaintiff's motion pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 702 to exclude Dr. Bogost's expert report is
denied.

Report of Mr. James E. Malackowski

Mr. Malackowski is chairman and chief executive officer of a company that provides financial services related to intellectual
property, including valuations and strategy consulting. His declaration and report explain that he reviewed Dr. Jay's survey
data and concluded that (i) none of the profits associated with NBA 2K are attributable to the Tattoos and, as a result,
Plaintiff has not been damaged by Defendants’ alleged infringement, (ii) there is currently no market for licensing tattoo
artwork, and (iii) such market is unlikely to develop. Plaintiff challenges Mr. Malackowski's report as (i) providing a legal
conclusion, (ii) ""wholly irrelevant to Defendants’ acts of infringement and to the material issues in this lawsuit,"" and (iii) based
on hearsay. Plaintiff also asserts that Mr. Malackowski is not qualified to give an opinion on the market for licensing tattoos.

Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendants caused direct and proximate harm to the Plaintiff,"" and, as a result, ""Plaintiff is entitled to
damages in an amount to be determined at trial."" (SAC 42.) Therefore, the issue of damages is squarely raised in this
litigation and Defendants are entitled to offer opinions from experts, like Mr. Malackowski, on the issue of damages. See
Semerdjian v. McDougal Littell _641 F. Supp. 2d 233 , 242-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (permitting expert to testify regarding
damages calculation in copyright infringement suit). Plaintiff does not challenge Mr. Malackowski's methodology or his
qualifications as a damages expert. Furthermore, Mr. Malackowski's reliance in part on Dr. Jay's survey results, which, as
discussed above, have not been excluded, is not improper. U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n v. PHL Variable Life Ins. Co. , 112 F. Supp.
3d 122, 131 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (holding that an expert ""is permitted to rely on facts, opinions, and data not of the expert's own
making—including analyses performed or findings made by another expert in the case—even if those facts, opinions, and
data are otherwise inadmissible""). Mr. Malackowski's opinions concerning the market for licensing tattoos are directly
relevant to the fourth fair use factor, which concerns the effect upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work. Plaintiff's motion to exclude Mr. Malackowski's declaration and testimony is denied.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted in its entirety and Plaintiff's cross
motion to exclude Defendants’ expert testimony is denied.

Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint is dismissed in its entirety. Defendants are granted summary judgment on their First
and Second Counterclaims, and the Court hereby declares that Defendants’ use of the Tattoos in the challenged versions of
their video game is de minimis and fair use and therefore does not infringe Plaintiff's copyrights.

[449 F.Supp.3d 354]
This Memorandum Opinion and Order resolves Docket Entry Nos. 127 and 147.

Defendants’ Third Counterclaim remains unresolved. The parties are directed to meet and confer and file a joint report as to
what, if any, steps remain to be taken to settle or otherwise resolve the Third Counterclaim. The joint report must be filed by
May 15, 2020 , and shall be directed to Magistrate Judge Aaron, to whom this case remains referred for general pretrial
management.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:

1Defendants have moved for summary judgment as to their first and second counterclaims only. Defendants’ third counterclaim for ""declaratory judgment
of fraud on the Copyright Office"" remains pending. (Def. Countercl. 4] 228-35.)

2The facts presented or recited as undisputed are drawn from the parties’ statements pursuant to S.D.N.Y. Local Civil Rule 56.1, or from evidence as to
which there is no non-conclusory factual proffer. Citations to Defendants’ Local Civil Rule 56.1 Statement (Defendants-Counterclaimants 2K Games, Inc.
and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.'s Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Facts in Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment (""Def. 56.1""),
Docket Entry No. 129) and Plaintiffs Counterstatement (Response to Defendants’ Rule 56.1 Statement of Purportedly Undisputed Facts (PI. 56.1""),
Docket Entry No. 146) incorporate by reference citations to the underlying evidentiary submissions. Plaintiff proffered no citations to record evidence to
the extent it purported to dispute Defendants’ documented proffers of undisputed facts in Defendants’ 56.1 statement. Where Plaintiff purported to deny or
dispute particular statements, Plaintiff made arguments regarding relevance or other legal issues or, as addressed infra , challenged the relevance or
basis of proffered expert testimony.

3 The Court notes that Solid Oak has not proffered images of the Tattoo designs. For purposes of its substantial similarity analysis, the Court has used
the Tattoo images included in James Malackowski's Declaration. (Declaration of James Malackowski in Support of Defendants-Counterclaimants' Motion

OPINION & ORDER
VERNON S. BRODERICK, United States District Judge:

Plaintiff Rebecca Fay Walsh brings this action against Townsquare Media, Inc., asserting a claim of copyright infringement in
connection with Defendant's unlicensed publication in an online article (the ""Article"") of a copyrighted photograph (the
""Photograph"") taken by Plaintiff. Before me is Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Because Defendant's
publication of the Photograph constituted fair use, Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED.

[464 F.Supp.3d 575]

|. Factual Background +

Plaintiff is a Brooklyn-based professional photographer who licenses her photographs to online and print media for a fee.
(Am. Compl. 4 5.) 2 Defendant is a Delaware-incorporated business that owns and operates an online website called XXL
Mag (""XXL""), located at the URL www.XXLMag.com . ( /d. {4 6-7.)

On September 5, 2018, Plaintiff photographed rapper and celebrity Cardi B at a Tom Ford Fashion show in New York City. (
Id. ¥ 10.) At around the time of the fashion show, she captured numerous photographs of Cardi B, and then made them
available for license through Getty Images, a stock photography agency. ( /d. 4 15; id. Ex. C). Among those photographs is
the one at issue in this action, reproduced below in resized but uncropped form:

[464 F.Supp.3d 576]

(Id. Ex. A.) Plaintiff has a copyright to the Photograph, which is registered with the United States Copyright Office. ( Id. J
11.)

On September 10, 2018, Townsquare ran an article on XXL Mag entitled Cardi B Partners with Tom Ford for New Lipstick
Shade , available at the URL https:/Awww.xxlmag.com/news/2018/09/cardi-b-tom-ford-lipstick-shade-named-after-her/. ( Id. J
13.) The text of the Article read as follows:

Cardi B is having a busy 2018 New York Fashion Week. After allegedly getting into a fight with Nicki Minaj, the
Invasion of Privacy rapper is now getting her own shade of lipstick from Tom Ford.

The Tom Ford Beauty brand broke the news on Sunday (Sept. 9), posting an image of the bold blue shade and
Cardi's name on Instagram. ""Meet Cardi. #TFBOYSANDGIRLS #TFLIP #TOMFORDBEAUTY,"" the caption of the
post reads.

Cardi also celebrated the news on IG 3, re-posting the Tom Ford post and adding, ""Thank you so much
@tomford and @tomfordbeauty!!! So excited for this and what's to come.""

Just the latest shade in Tom Ford's Lips & Boys collection, the new Cardi shade follows the brand's trend of
naming lipsticks after other celebrities such as Julianne [Moore], Dakota [Johnson] and Naomi [Campbell].
There's no word yet when the lipstick inspired by Cardi will be released.

As expected, the decision to name a lipstick after Cardi following the New York Fashion Week incident has led to
a heated debate on the original Instagram post. While some fans were excited about the upcoming product,
other's felt that Cardi doesn't deserve to have a lipstick named after her.

But Cardi doesn't seemed to bothered by that. In another Instagram post, the rapper claimed the upcoming
lipstick has already sold out, adding, ""Sorry:/.....""

[464 F.Supp.3d 577]


--- Page 2 ---
In footage from the fight, the ""Be Careful"" rapper can be seen throwing a shoe in the direction of someone,
although it's hard to make out if it's actually Minaj. Cardi can also be heard yelling at someone for talking about
her daughter, Kulture. ""Write some shit about my daughter again,"" Cardi says.

While it was reported that Bardi's fight was with the Queen artist, Cardi reportedly ended up fighting former Love
& Hip Hop: New York star Rah Ali.

(Ans. Ex. C (alterations and errors in original).) Beneath the last sentence of the article, XXL Mag embedded the three
Instagram posts that were described in the Article. 4( /d. 4 13; Ans. ¥ 13.) Plaintiff does not allege that the Post was
embedded, alleging only that Defendant ""expropriated"" the Photograph and ""displayed"" it in the Article. (Am. Compl. {{ 13,
15.) However, Defendant asserts that the Post was ""embedded"" (Ans. § 13), and Plaintiff does not dispute this allegation.
Moreover, in the current version of the Article, the two Instagram posts that remain displayed link directly to Instagram when
clicked on, indicating they have been embedded. See Article, https:/www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/09/cardi-b-tom-ford-
lipstick-shade-named-after-her/ (last visited April 2, 2020). The first post, by account ""tomfordbeauty,"" announced the lipstick
collaboration. (Strom Decl. Ex. C, at 3.) 5 The second post, from Cardi B's account, reproduced the post by tomfordbeauty in
a screenshot, and thanked Tom Ford and tomfordbeauty. ( /d. at 4.) The third post (the ""Post""), from Cardi B, was a
composite image that consisted of an image of the Tom Ford lipstick on the left, the Photograph on the right, and a header
reading ""Cardi B's Tom Ford Lipstick has already SOLD OUT!!!"" ( /d. at 5.) Above the composite image was Cardi B's
username, her follower count, and a link entitled ""View Profile."" ( /d. ) Below the composite image was a link entitled ""View
More on Instagram,"" the number of ""likes,"" and Cardi B's caption for the post: ""Sorry:/ ..."" ( /d. at 5.) Below the caption was a
link entitled ""view all [ ] comments"" and below that, a link entitled ""Add a comment ...."" ( /d. )

The Post appeared as follows:
[464 F.Supp.3d 578]

(Id. Ex. C; Strom Decl. Ex. C.) After Plaintiff filed this lawsuit, Defendant removed the Post from the Article. (Am. Compl. 4
17.)

Il. Procedural History

Plaintiff commenced this action by filing a complaint on May 28, 2019. (Doc. 1.) The complaint was administratively rejected
by the Clerk's Office, and Plaintiff refiled the complaint on May 29, 2019. (Doc. 4.) Defendant filed its answer on June 26,
2019. (Doc. 10.) Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on July 17, 2019. (Doc. 11.) Defendant filed its Answer to the
Amended Complaint on July 31, 2019. (Doc. 12.)

On August 9, 2019, Defendant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, (Doc. 14), with a memorandum of law,
declaration, and exhibits in support, (Docs. 15-16). Plaintiff filed her memorandum of law in opposition on September 6,
2019. (Doc. 19.) Defendant filed its reply on September 24, 2019. (Doc. 21.)

Ill. Legal Standard

Rule 12(c) provides that ""[a]fter the pleadings are closed—but early enough not to delay trial—a party may move for
judgment on the pleadings."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). In deciding a motion for judgment on the pleadings, a district court must
""employ the same standard applicable to Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, accepting all factual allegations in the [non-
moving party's pleading] as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the nonmoving party's favor.""

[464 F.Supp.3d 579]

Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist. , 801 F.3d 72 , 78 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, to
survive a motion pursuant to Rule 12(c), a complaint must ""contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a
claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Hayden v. Paterson , 594 F.3d 150 , 160 (2d Cir. 2010). Under Rule 12(c), a party
is entitled to judgment on the pleadings ""only if it has established that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and
that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Juster Assocs. v. City of Rutland , 901 F.2d 266 , 269 (2d Cir. 1990)
(internal quotation marks omitted); see Sellers v. M.C. Floor Crafters, Inc. 842 F.2d 639 , 642 (2d Cir. 1988) (noting that
judgment on the pleadings ""is appropriate where material facts are undisputed and where a judgment on the merits is
possible merely by considering the contents of the pleadings"").

On a Rule 12(c) motion, ""the court considers the complaint, the answer, any written documents attached to them, and any
matter of which the court can take judicial notice for the factual background of the case."" L-7 Designs. Inc. v. Old Navy, LLC

647 F.3d 419 , 422 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The complaint is ""deemed to include any written
instrument attached to it as an exhibit, materials incorporated in it by reference, and documents that, although not
incorporated by reference, are integral to the complaint."" /d. (internal quotation marks omitted).

IV. Discussion


--- Page 3 ---
A. Applicable Law

The Copyright Act grants a copyright owner the exclusive rights to authorize the reproduction, distribution, and preparation
of derivatives of the owner's work. 17 U.S.C. § 106. These rights, however, are in ""inevitable tension"" with ""the ability of
authors, artists, and the rest of us to express them-or ourselves by reference to the works of others."" Blanch v. Koons . 467
F.3d 244 , 250 (2d Cir. 2006). The doctrine of fair use mediates between these two sets of interests and infuses copyright
law with the necessary ""breathing space."" /d. (quoting Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ). Under this doctrine, ""a defendant who otherwise would have violated one or more of these
exclusive rights may avoid liability if [it] can establish that [it] made ‘fair use’ of the copyrighted material."" Swatch Grp. Mgmt.
Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. , 756 F.3d 73 , 81 (2d Cir. 2014). ""To evaluate whether a particular use qualifies as ‘fair use,’
[a court] must engage in ‘an open-ended and context-sensitive inquiry’ "" that focuses on four non-exclusive factors set forth
in the Copyright Act: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the work, (3) the amount and substantiality
of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for
or value of copyrighted work. /d. (quoting Blanch__467 F.3d at 250 ). The Copyright Act also provides examples of purposes
for copying that would constitute fair use: criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. 17
U.S.C. § 107. These examples, however, are ""illustrative and not limitative,"" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ,
and the court's ""task is not to be simplified with bright-line rules,"" Swatch_._756 F.3d at 81 (quoting id. ).

Fair use is an affirmative defense, and so a defendant accused of copyright infringement bears the burden of showing that
its use of a work was fair_ Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 213 (2d Cir. 2015). The determination of fair use is
typically a ""mixed question of fact and law."" Swatch__756 F.3d at 81 . However, it may be adjudicated on a

[464 F.Supp.3d 580]

Rule 12(c) motion ""where the facts necessary to establish the defense are evident on the face of the complaint."" Kelly-
Brown v. Winfrey . 717 F.3d 295 , 308 (2d Cir. 2013) ;see also In re Lehr Constr. Corp. , 666 F. App'x 66, 68 (2d Cir. 2016)
(summary order). Accordingly, numerous courts in this district have ""resolved the issue of fair use on a motion for judgment
on the pleadings by conducting a side-by-side comparison of the works at issue."" Lombardo v. Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. ,
279 F. Supp. 3d 497, 504 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), aff'd, 729 F. App'x 131 (2d Cir. 2018).

B. Application

Plaintiff asserts that Defendant infringed on her copyright by reproducing the Photograph on its website without licensing it.
(Am. Compl. ¥{ 19-24.) Defendant does not dispute, for purposes of this motion, that it reproduced the Photograph, £but
contends that its use of the Photograph was fair. (Def.’s Mem. ¢ 8.) To assess whether Defendant's reproduction of the
Photograph was a fair use, | consider each of the four factors in turn.

1. The Purpose and Character of the Use

The first statutory factor—""[t]he heart of the fair use inquiry"" in this Circuit—calls on the court to examine ""the purpose and
character of the use,"" including whether the use ""is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.""_On
Davis v. The Gap, Inc. , 246 F.3d 152 , 174 (2d Cir. 2001), as amended (May 15, 2001); see also Blanch__ 467 F.3d at 251 .
The focus of this factor is whether the use ""merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds
something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message; it
asks, in other words, whether and to what extent the new work is transformative."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct.
1164 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). ""[A] transformative use is one that communicates something new and
different from the original or expands its utility, thus serving copyright's overall objective of contributing to public knowledge.""
Authors Guild_, 804 F.3d at 214 . ""[T]he critical inquiry is whether the new work uses the copyrighted material itself for a
purpose, or imbues it with a character, different from that for which it was created."" TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839
F.3d 168 , 180 (2d Cir. 2016).

While the Copyright Act suggests that use of a copyrighted work for news reporting purposes is likely to constitute fair use,
""a news reporting purpose by no means guarantees a finding of fair use."" Swatch__756 F.3d at 85 . ""After all, ""[t]he promise
of copyright would be an empty one if it could be avoided merely by dubbing the infringement a fair use ‘news report.’ "" /d.
(quoting Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises , 471 U.S. 539 , 557, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) .)
Thus, courts have held that it is not fair to ""use [ ] an image solely to

[464 F.Supp.3d 581]

present the content of that image, in a commercial capacity,"" or to otherwise use it ""for the precise reason it was created.""
BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, Inc. , 196 F. Supp. 3d 395, 407 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). For example, it is not fair use
to republish a photograph of a celebrity or public figure intended to generically accompany an article about that person or to
describe the event depicted in the photograph. See Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 352 ; BWP Media USA, Inc. , 196 F. Supp.
3d at 407 ; Otto v. Hearst Commc'ns, Inc. , 345 F. Supp. 3d 412, 429 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). 8Such uses ""merely supersede ] the
objects of the original creation."" See Blanch__467 F.3d at 251 . However, use of a copyrighted photograph may be
appropriate where ""the copyrighted work is itself the subject of the story, transforming the function of the work in the new



--- Page 4 ---
context."" Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 352. ""For instance, a news report about a video that has gone viral on the Internet
might fairly display a screenshot or clip from that video to illustrate what all the fuss is about. See, e.g. , Konangataa v. Am.
Broadcastingcompanies, Inc. , No. 16-CV-7382 (LAK), 2017 WL 2684067, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 21, 2017). Similarly, a
depiction of a controversial photograph might fairly accompany a work of commentary or criticism about the artistic merit or
appropriateness of the photograph. See, e.g. , Nunez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp. , 235 F.3d 18 , 25 (1st Cir. 2000).""2/d.
Courts have also found fair use in cases in which a website published a screenshot of an article from another publication
hat contained a copyrighted photograph, alongside criticism of the article. Yang v. Mic Network, Inc. , 405 F. Supp. 3d 537,
544 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (deciding a motion to dismiss); Clark v. Transportation Alternatives, Inc. , 2019 WL 1448448, at *4
(S.D.N.Y. 2019) (same).

Applying these principles and drawing all inferences in Plaintiff's favor, this factor favors Defendant because the Article uses
he Photograph for an entirely different purpose than originally intended. The Photograph was taken to ""depict Cardi B at
Tom Ford's fashion show."" (PI.’s Opp. 13.) 12 See also Barcroft Media, Ltd. v. Coed Media Group, LLC , 297 F. Supp. 3d 339,
352 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (""Paparazzi photographs ... are designed to document the comings and goings of celebrities, illustrate
heir fashion and lifestyle choices, and accompany gossip and news articles about their lives.""). However, as is apparent on
he face of the Article, Defendant did not publish the Photograph simply to present its content. It did not use the Photograph
as a generic image of Cardi B

464 F.Supp.3d 582]

‘0 accompany an article about Cardi B, see BWP Media USA , 196 F. Supp. 3d at 407, or as an image of her at Tom Ford's
ashion show alongside an article about the fashion show, see Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 352 ; Otto v. Hearst Commc'ns,
Inc. , 345 F. Supp. 3d 412, 429 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). +1 Rather, Defendant published the Post, which incidentally contained the
Photograph, because the Post—or, put differently, the fact that Cardi B had disseminated the Post—was the very thing the
Article was reporting on. 12

The Article begins by juxtaposing the news of the lipstick collaboration with rumors that Cardi B had recently gotten into a
fight with Nicki Minaj, another rapper. It goes on to describe the social media posts by Tom Ford and Cardi B introducing the
collaboration, and the ensuing ""heated debate"" among fans about that announcement, in light of the rumors about the fight.
Then the Article presents Cardi B's reaction to that ""heated debate"": her Instagram post reporting that the lipstick has sold
out, with the caption: ""Sorry:/ ..."" Finally, the Article reports additional facts about the rumored fight, then embeds the
relevant Instagram posts, one of which happens to include the Photograph because the original poster—Cardi B—included
it. The Article does not mention the Photograph, nor does the Photograph in and of itself pertain to anything reported on in
the Article. Thus, Defendant's inclusion of the Photograph as part of the Post was not simply to ""present the content of that
image""—Cardi B, or perhaps Cardi B at the Tom Ford fashion show, i.e. the purpose the Photograph was created for 18—
Gossip Cop Media, Inc. , 196 F. Supp. 3d at 407. Rather, Cardi B's making and dissemination of the Post, not the image that
was posted, was ""itself the subject of the story."" Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 352. In other words, Defendant published the
Post in order to provide readers with the original social media interactions reported on by the Article, 44and

[464 F.Supp.3d 583]

included the Photograph as a necessary part of the Post. 5Indeed, no other image—not even ""the Photograph [itself] as a
standalone image""—would have fulfilled the same purpose as the Post itself, see Clark , 2019 WL 1448448. 16 Merely
displaying the Post without the Photograph would have been nonsensical in appearance as well as potentially impossible,
given that the Post is embedded and hyperlinked, rather than inserted as an image. The Photograph's function was wholly
""transform[ed] ... in [its] new context,"" Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 352, and as a result the Article's publication of the Post in
no way ""merely supersedes"" the original work. See Campbell__510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164.

Judge Paul G. Gardephe's analysis in Ferdman v. CBS Interactive Inc. , 342 F. Supp. 3d 515, 534 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) is
instructive, although the facts did not mirror the facts here, making the decision distinguishable. In Ferdman , the defendant
published an article that stated that ""images and videos from the set [of Spider-Man: Homecoming] have steadily emerged.
The newest shot comes from [the Instagram of] Spider-Man actor Tom Holland himself."" /d. at 523. The article then
described that image, which had been posted to Holland's Instagram, repeated Holland's accompanying caption, and
inserted the photograph—not the Instagram post itself—below the article. See id. Judge Gardephe observed that, as in
Nunez , the photograph ""was the story,"" but ultimately denied defendant's motion for summary judgment because (1) there
were no visual differences between the copyrighted photograph and the photograph included in the article, and (2) the
statement at the beginning of the article that ""images and videos have steadily emerged"" suggested that the photograph
might merely have been used to ""announce its existence,"" which would not be transformative. /d. at 534-37. Judge
Gardephe held that these issues might cause reasonable jurors to disagree about whether the use was transformative and
so the issue could not be resolved as a matter of law. /d. at 537.

Here, as in Ferdman , the Post ""was the story."" /d. at 534. But unlike in Ferdman , Defendant embedded the entire Instagram
Post, still bearing the rest of the elements of the image that Cardi B had posted—the

[464 F.Supp.3d 584]


--- Page 5 ---
header and the photo of the Tom Ford lipstick—along with Cardi B's caption and various Instagram standard links, making
clear that the subject of the image was the Post, not the Photograph. Cf. Yang, 405 F. Supp.3d at 544 (""To the extent that
the Photograph was used as part of the composite Screenshot to identify the Post Article itself, it indisputably constitutes a
different use than its original purpose.""); Clark , 2019 WL 1448448, at *3 (in finding defendant's use fair, noting that the
article ""did not reproduce the Photograph as a standalone image, but as part of the Screenshot's composite image that
showed the manner in which the Post Article's headline, author byline, and the Photograph were arranged on the Post’s
website."") In addition, unlike the article in Ferdman , Defendant's Article does not even mention the Photograph itself, much
less report on it specifically; its focus is on the launch of the Tom Ford lipstick, the ensuing social media controversy, and
Cardi B's Post. These distinctions foreclose a reasonable juror from finding Defendant's use not transformative.

The fact that the Article did not include any commentary or criticism about the Post, unlike the uses in Yang and Clark , does
not undermine this conclusion. While ""[c]ourts often find [news reporting] uses transformative by emphasizing the altered
purpose or context of the work, as evidenced by surrounding commentary or criticism,"" commentary or criticism is not
required to render a use transformative where ""the two works halve] different messages and purposes."" Swatch__756 F.3d at
84 (finding that news service's publication of audio recording of plaintiff's earnings call was fair use even though news
service ""provided no additional commentary or analysis,"" because the sound recording provided additional data not

available in the transcript, and defendant's ""purpose ... was to publish this factual information to an audience from which
[plaintiff's] purpose was to withhold it."")

Nor does the perhaps trivial nature of the Article weigh against Defendant. ( See Def.’s Opp. 11.) While ""[t]he ultimate test of
fair use ... is whether the copyright law's goal of ‘promoting the Progress of Science and useful Arts,’ [ U.S. Const., art. I, § 8,
cl. 8,] would be better served by allowing the use than by preventing it,"" Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. . 448
F.3d 605 , 608 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted), the Supreme Court has cautioned courts to ""be chary of
deciding what is and what is not news,"" Harper & Row. 471 U.S. at 561 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; see also Nunez. 235 F.3d at 22 —
23 (""[T]he fact that the story is admittedly on the tawdry side of the news ledger does not make it any less of a fair use."");
Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 535 (declining to evaluate the newsworthiness of the copyrighted photograph).

Finally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant is ""a for-profit publisher"" that ""disseminates commercial news content on its website""
including advertisements, ""evincing Defendant's intent to exploit Plaintiff's work."" (PI.’s Opp. 14.) The commercial nature of a
use may indeed counsel against a finding of fair use. See Swatch__756 F.3d at 83 ; Harper & Row. 471 U.S. at 562 , 105
S.Ct. 2218 (""The fact that a publication was commercial as opposed to nonprofit is a separate factor that tends to weigh
against a finding of fair use."") However, the Second Circuit has recognized that ""almost all newspapers, books and
magazines are published by commercial enterprises that seek a profit."" Swatch._756 F.3d at 83 . The Supreme Court has
acknowledged that tension and ""stated that ‘[t]he crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of the
use is monetary gain but whether the user

[464 F.Supp.3d 585]

stands to profit from exploitation of copyrighted material without paying the customary price.’"""" BWP Media USA, Inc. , 196 F.
Supp. 3d at 407-08 (quoting Harper & Row., 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ). ""That a defendant's use of copyrighted
material is for profit bears less weight when that use is highly transformative; but where a defendant's use merely
‘supersedes the objects’ of the original, the commercial nature becomes more relevant."" /d. (quoting Cariou_., 714 F.3d at 708

); see also Blanch__467 F.3d at 254 . Here, regardless of whether Defendant profits from pageviews of the Article, its use of
the Photograph is transformative, outweighing the commercial nature of the use.

Accordingly, | find that the first factor strongly favors fair use.
2. The Nature of the Work

The second statutory factor looks at the nature of the copyrighted work and its expressive content. See 17 U.S.C. § 107(2).
This factor acknowledges ""the fact that ‘some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with
the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied.’ "" Swatch__756 F.3d at 87
(quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). In assessing this factor, ""courts consider whether a work is creative
versus factual, and unpublished versus published, with copyright protections applying more broadly to creative and
unpublished works."" BWP Media USA, Inc. , 196 F. Supp. 3d at 408 (citing Harper & Row._471 U.S. at 563 -64, 105 S.Ct.
2218 and Blanch_, 467 F.3d at 256 ). Nevertheless, the Second Circuit has acknowledged that this factor ""has rarely played
a significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute."" Authors Guild__804 F.3d at 220 .

Here, the Photograph contains ""both informational and creative elements"": it was taken to ""document [its] subject,"" a
celebrity, but also displays some ""technical skill and aesthetic judgment."" BWP Media USA , 196 F. Supp. 3d at 408 ; see
also Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 354 (""Although photography, including photography of a celebrity walking around in public,
certainly involves skill and is not devoid of expressive merit, the [paparazzi] Images are further from the core of copyright
protections than creative or fictional works would be."") This ""render[s] the degree of creativity a relatively neutral
consideration."" BWP Media USA, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 408. However, the Photograph was previously published by Cardi B on
her Instagram; thus, pairing the neutrality of the images ""with the fact of previous publication, the nature of the images tips
slightly in Defendant's favor."" /d.


--- Page 6 ---
Therefore, the second factor weighs in favor of fair use.
3. The Portion of the Work Used

The third statutory factor is ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.""
17 U.S.C. § 107(3). This factor compares the portion of the use with the copyrighted work as a whole, with the goal of
determining if it is ""reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" Campbell. 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The
court considers ""not only the quantity of the materials taken but also ‘their quality and importance’ to the original work.""
Cariou__714 F.3d at 710 . ""The crux of the inquiry is whether ‘no more was taken than necessary.’ 'N. Jersey Media Grp.

Inc. v. Pirro , 74 F. Supp. 3d 605, 620-21 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust, 755 F.3d 87 , 98 (2d
Cir. 2014) ).

As a quantitative matter, the Post included an uncropped, though resized, version of the Photograph. As a qualitative matter,
however, although Plaintiff complains

[464 F.Supp.3d 586]

that Defendant could have used any other image of Cardi B to accompany its article or requested a license from Plaintiff,
(Def.’s Mem. 11), the Post is the only image that could have accomplished XXL Mag's journalistic objective of describing a
social media story and providing readers with the relevant posts. Even the Photograph itself, on its own, would not have
been a reasonable substitute. Further, within its objective, Defendant used only as much of the Photograph as was already
included in Cardi B's Post; in other words, ""no more was taken than necessary."" Pirro , 74 F. Supp. 3d at 621 ; see also
Yang , 405 F. Supp. 3d at 546-47 (""[I]f copying the original ‘any less would [make] the picture useless to the story[,]’ the
substantiality of the copying is ""of little consequence."" (quoting Nunez_._235 F.3d at 24 )"").

Therefore, the third factor weighs in favor of fair use.
4. The Potential Market for or Value of the Work

The fourth factor evaluates the effect of the use on the market for or the value of the original work. See 17 U.S.C. § 107(4).
""When a secondary use competes in the rightsholder's market as an effective substitute for the original, it impedes the
purpose of copyright to incentivize new creative works by enabling their creators to profit from them.""_Capito! Records, LLC
v. ReDigi Inc. , 910 F.3d 649 , 662 (2d Cir. 2018). Courts look here not for theoretical or speculative harm, but for copying of
""sufficiently significant portions of the original as to make available a significantly competing substitute."" Authors Guild, 804
F.3d at 223 . The focus is on whether the use would ""deprive the rights holder of significant revenues because of the
likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original."" /d. Here, because the
Photograph did not appear on its own, but as part of the Post, alongside text and another image, it is implausible that
Defendant's use would compete with Plaintiff's business or affect the market or value of her work. See Authors Guild_, 804
F.3d at 223 ; Yang, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 548 ; Clark, 2019 WL 1448448, at “4 (assessing whether a website's publication of a
screenshot of a newspaper article that included copyrighted photograph constituted fair use). ""[T]here is little risk that
someone looking to license or purchase an image of a [Cardi B] would select the [Post] instead of the Photograph, thereby
potentially diverting revenue to [Defendant] that would have otherwise gone to [Plaintiff]."" /d. (citing Capito! Records, LLC_.
910 F.3d at 662 -63 ).

Thus, the fourth factor also weighs in favor of fair use.
5. Overall Assessment

The four non-exclusive statutory factors discussed above are to be weighed together, along with any other relevant
considerations, in light of the goals of copyright laws. See Authors Guild_, 804 F.3d at 225 . Drawing all reasonable
inferences in Plaintiff's favor, | have found that on the face of the Amended Complaint, the four factors weigh in favor of
Defendant: ""Defendant's use was transformative, its use was reasonable in light of that end, the work was already
published, and there is no plausible risk to any market for licensing of the original work."" Yang , 405 F. Supp. 3d at 548. This
is sufficient to establish an affirmative defense of fair use on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and | conclude that
Defendant's use of the Photograph was fair as a matter of law. See id.

V. Conclusion

is directed to terminate the motion

[464 F.Supp.3d 587]

Notes:

1The following facts are taken from the Amended Complaint and its accompanying exhibits, as well as the PDF of the full Article that has been submitted
by Defendant. | assume the factual allegations set forth in those submissions to be true for purposes of this motion. See Kassner v. 2nd Ave.
Delicatessen Inc._, 496 F.3d 229 , 237 (2d Cir. 2007) ; see also Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc. , 282 F.3d 147 , 152 (2d Cir. 2002) (A complaint is
""deemed to include any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by reference.... Even where a
document is not incorporated by reference, the court may nevertheless consider it where the complaint relies heavily upon its terms and effect, which
renders the document integral to the complaint."" (internal quotations and citations omitted)); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c) (""A copy of any written instrument
which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes.""). As discussed in further detail in this section, Defendant contends, and Plaintiff does
not dispute, that the original Article had three embedded images, the third of which contained a portion of the Photograph. (Ans. Ex. C.) Plaintiff attached
to the Amended Complaint a partial screenshot of the Article as it appeared online, with the headline, article text, and the first embedded image. ( See
Am. Compl. Ex. D.) Plaintiff separately includes a screenshot of the third embedded image—the one that contained the Photograph—as Exhibit C. ( See
id. Ex. C.) Defendant submitted, as Exhibit C to the Declaration of Rachel F. Strom, a screenshot of the entire Article, featuring the same text as Plaintiff's
version but including all three embedded images. ( See Doc. 16-3.) Plaintiff does not contest the authenticity or accuracy of these screenshots or suggest
that | should not consider them. In light of these facts, and in light of the fact that Plaintiff relies extensively on the Article—as the source of the
publication of the Photograph that gave rise to its claims—I consider Defendant's more complete version of the Article. | also find it appropriate to
consider the current version of the Article as it appears online, given that Plaintiff herself provided the URL and makes an allegation about the Article in
its current form, making it ""integral"" to her Complaint, Chambers__282 F.3d 147 . ( See Am. Compl. 9 13, 17; Cardi B Partners with Tom Ford for New
Lipstick Shade , XXL Mag, https:/Awww.xxlmag.com/news/2018/09/cardi-b-tom-ford-lipstick-shade-named-after-her/ (last visited April 2, 2020).) Moreover,
""[i]t is generally proper to take judicial notice of articles and [websites] published on the [i]nternet."" Harty v. Nyack Motor Hotel Inc. , No. 19-CV-1322
(KMK), 2020 WL 1140783, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2020) (quoting Magnoni v. Smith & Laquercia, LLP__701 F. Supp. 2d 497 , 501 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), affd,
483 F. App'x 613 (2d Cir. 2012), and collecting cases). My references to Plaintiff's allegations should not be construed as a finding as to their veracity,
and | make no such findings.

2""Am. Compl."" refers to the Amended Complaint, filed on July 17, 2019. (Doc. 11.)
3""IG"" is apparently a shorthand for ""Instagram,"" a social media platform on which users post photographs and captions.

4An ""embedded"" image is one that ""hyperlink{s] ... to [a] third-party website."" Goldman v. Breitbart News Network, LLC , 302 F. Supp. 3d 585, 587
(S.D.N.Y. 2018). ""To embed an image, [a] coder or web designer ... add[s] an ‘embed code’ to the HTML instructions; this code directs the browser to the
third-party server to retrieve the image."" /d. Thus, the image appears on the new page, but links to and remains hosted on the third-party server or
website. See id.

8""Strom Decl."" refers to the Declaration of Rachel F. Strom in support of Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, filed on August 9, 2019.
(Doc. 16.)

&| note that the Second Circuit has not addressed whether and when embedding an image that is hosted elsewhere constitutes ""display"" within the
meaning of the Copyright Act, and only a handful of district courts across the country have discussed the question. See Goldman v. Breitbart News
Network, LLC , 302 F. Supp. 3d 585, 591 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (discussing cases and concluding that on the facts at bar, ""when defendants caused the
embedded Tweets to appear on their websites, their actions violated plaintiffs exclusive display right."") However, Defendant has not raised this issue,
and | do not address it.

2""Def.’s Mem."" refers to the Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant Townsquare Media, Inc.’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, filed on
August 9, 2019. (Doc. 15.)

8 These three cases were decided upon a fuller record than the instant case, but the courts’ decisions on the first fair use factor ultimately rested on a
comparison of the work and the publication that used the work. Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d 339 (after bench trial); BWP Media USA, Inc. , 196 F. Supp. 3d
at 407 (after bench trial); Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 427-30 (on summary judgment).

2 In Nunez , the plaintiff took photographs of the 1997 Miss Puerto Rico Universe, which generated public controversy about whether they were
""pornographic"" and whether the pageant winner should be permitted to retain her crown. 235 F.3d at 21 . The defendant published three of the
photographs alongside articles about the controversy. /d. The First Circuit held that the first prong weighed in favor of fair use because while the
photographs were initially created to appear in modeling portfolios, defendant published them ""to place its news articles in context; as the district court
pointed out, ‘the pictures were the story.’ It would have been much more difficult to explain the controversy without reproducing the photographs."" /d. at
23-24.

10""PI.'5 Opp."" refers to Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, filed on September 6, 2019.
(Doc. 19.)

11 The other cases cited by Plaintiff are also inapposite for similar reasons. ( See PI.’s Opp. 10.) In Ferdman v. CBS Interactive, Inc. , 342 F.Supp.3d 515,
533 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), the court granted summary judgment dismissing fair use defense as to one of two allegedly infringing uses where defendant ""merely
reported that ""[t]he upcoming Marvel Movie Spider-Man: Homecoming is currently filming in New York, and the steady stream of on-set images and
videos continues,"" then included a gallery of these images at the end of the article. ""In other words, the Gallery Article involves ‘the use of an image
solely to present the content of that image.’ BWP Media , 196 F.Supp.3d at 407. Such a use is not transformative."" /d. Similarly, in Psihoyos v. National
Examiner , 97-cv-7625 (JSM), 1998 WL 336655, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 22, 1998), defendant, a tabloid, published a copyrighted photograph of plaintiff in
front of his modified ""art car"" alongside an article about art cars in America and a caption reading ""Larry Fuente's fintastic Mad Cad is inlaid with beads,
rhinestones, shoe soles and toy soldiers—and highlighted with fabulous flamingo-adorned tail fins."" The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss,
which it treated as a motion for summary judgment, because ""[t]he Examiner's use [was] not transformative ... its piece uses the photo to show what it
depicts."" /d. These cases are distinguishable for the same reasons BWP Media , Barcroft , and Otto are distinguishable.

12 Plaintiff contends at one point that Defendant used the Photograph merely to illustrate ""a news report about Cardi B at Tom Ford's fashion show.”
(Def.’s Opp. 13.) This is manifestly untrue; although the Article generally mentions ""Fashion Week"" being ""busy"" for Cardi B, it does not mention the Tom
Ford fashion show in particular.

13 Although Cardi B may have used the Photograph in this illustrative manner, the purpose her underlying use, whether licensed or unlicensed, has no
bearing on whether Defendant's use of the Photograph for an entirely different function and purpose was fair.

14 A further logical inference of Defendant's purpose is that Defendant sought to link readers to the relevant posts; however, Defendant does not explicitly
make this argument.

15 Plaintiff argues that Defendant's use was not transformative because it ""did not report on any political or social controversy that arose because of the


--- Page 8 ---
very existence of the Photograph itself."" (Def.’s Mem. 7.) ""As the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has instructed, ‘[t]he law imposes
no requirement that a work comment on the original or its author in order to be considered transformative.’ "" Clark , 2019 WL 1448448, at *3 (quoting
Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 706 (2d Cir. 2013) ).

18 Plaintiff alleges in her Amended Complaint that after she filed the initial Complaint, Defendant ""replaced the Post with another image of Cardi B that it
licensed through Getty Images, demonstrating that Defendant's unauthorized use of the Photograph in the first instance was not integral to the message
it sought to convey."" (Am. Compl. ¥ 17.) In support of this statement, Plaintiff cites to Exhibit D, but Exhibit D is simply a screenshot of the Article that
includes a portion of the Instagram post from Tom Ford, but is cut off below that and includes no other images or Posts. Thus, Exhibit D does not support
Plaintiff's allegation. Indeed, the Article in its current form contradicts it: it includes only the Tom Ford Instagram post and Cardi B's post thanking Tom
Ford, but does not contain any other images. This suggests that Defendant simply deleted the Post and did not insert any alternative image—or if it did
insert an alternative image, ultimately deleted it—lending further support for the idea that the Post was the only image that made sense in context.

ORDER

ANALISA TORRES, District Judge:

Plaintiff, Robert O'Neil, brings this action alleging copyright infringement by Defendants, Emily Ratajkowski and Emrata
Holdings, LLC. Compl., ECF No. 1. The parties cross-move for summary judgment. ECF Nos. 37, 42. For the reasons stated
below, both motions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

BACKGROUND

The facts discussed in this opinion are undisputed except where otherwise noted. The Court has drawn all reasonable
inferences in favor of the nonmovant. See Costello v. City of Burlington , 632 F.3d 41 , 45 (2d Cir. 2011).4

[563 F.Supp.3d 122]

Ratajkowski is a professional model and actress, who also heads a clothing line. Inamorata. Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 1-2, ECF No.
47: Pl. 56.1 Stmt. ¢57, ECF No. 45. Ratajkowski also personally runs an Instagram account with the username Emrata (the
""Instagram Account""). Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 2-3. Ratajkowski usually posts personal or political photographs, but she has
posted ""sponsored posts"" on her main Instagram feed, and, more rarely, her Instagram Stories, which disappear in 24
hours. /d. ; Pl. 56.1 Stmt. § 39; Ratajkowski Dep. Tr. at 17:19-18:2, 49:9-14, ECF No. 44-4. The main profile page of the
Instagram Account also includes a link to her clothing line. Pl. 56.1 Stmt. 57. All money she makes through acting,
modeling, or the Instagram Account flows to Emrata Holdings, LLC (""Emrata""). Ratajkowski Dep. Tr. at 85:3-15.

Plaintiff is a ""paparazzi photographer,"" who generally attempts to take ""candid"" shots of celebrities unaware of his presence.
Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 3.

On September 13, 2019, Plaintiff photographed Ratajkowski outside of the Adore Flower Shop in downtown Manhattan. /d.
at 7-8. He took nine frames in rapid succession, including the photograph at issue here (the ""Photograph""), which depicts
Ratajkowski on the street, with her face covered by the bouquet of flowers she pulled in front of her face (an action Plaintiff
interprets as her hiding from paparazzi photographers). Photograph, ECF No. 1-1; Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 7-8.

Plaintiff then uploaded the Photograph to Splash News (""Splash""), Plaintiffs agency. Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 5-6; PI. 56.1 Stmt.
24. Splash posts Plaintiff's photographs online for licensing to its subscribers, in exchange for 40 percent of any license fees.
Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 5; Pl. 56.1 Stmt. § 24. Plaintiff made minimal, if any, income from the Photograph. O'Neil Dep. Tr. at
80:25-81:11, ECF No. 44-5. Plaintiff states he also sent the Photograph to his attorney, who then registered it, along with
747 other photographs, with the United States Copyright Office (the ""Copyright Office""); his counsel states that this resulted
in registration certification VA 2-173-330 (the ""Registration""). Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 8-9, 13; Pl. 56.1 Stmt. § 69; Leibowitz Decl.
{91 8-9, ECF No. 44; Registration, ECF No. 43-4.

On September 18, 2019, Ratajkowski posted the Photograph to the Instagram Stories of the Instagram Account. Pl. 56.1
Stmt. ¥ 25; Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 2, 16. It (the ""Instagram Photograph"") was automatically deleted after 24 hours. Def. 56.1
Stmt. at 7. The Photograph and the Instagram Photograph are largely the same, except Ratajkowski added the words
""mood forever"" to the bottom of the Instagram Photograph. Photograph; Instagram Photograph, ECF No. 1-2; Pl. 56.1 Stmt.
431; Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 7.

On October 23, 2019, Plaintiff filed this action, alleging copyright infringement against Defendants. Compl. Defendants move
for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) the Photograph is not the

[563 F.Supp.3d 123]

subject of a valid copyright, (2) Ratajkowski's reposting was fair use, (3) Plaintiff has not suffered damages, and (4) Plaintiff
cannot show facts establishing Emrata's involvement. Def. Mem. at 2-4, ECF No. 38. Defendants also seek an order


--- Page 2 ---
granting sanctions and attorney's fees. /d. at 3-4. Plaintiff cross-moves for partial summary judgment on the elements of his
infringement claim and on Defendants’ affirmative defenses to liability. PI. Mem. at 2, ECF No. 46.

DISCUSSION

|. Legal Standard

On a motion for summary judgment, the movant must show ""that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [that
it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears the initial burden of pointing to
evidence in the record ""which it believes demonstrate[s] the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.""_Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett , 477 U.S. 317 , 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . The movant may support an assertion that there is no
genuine dispute by ""showing ... that [the] adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact."" Fed. R.
Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B). A genuine dispute of material fact exists when ""the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a
verdict for the nonmoving party."" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242 , 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202
(1986) . On summary judgment, the Court construes the facts, resolves all ambiguities, and draws all permissible factual
inferences in favor of the non-moving party. See Dallas Aerospace. Inc. v. CIS Air Corp. , 352 F.3d 775 , 780 (2d Cir. 2003).

Il. Copyright Infringement

""To establish copyright infringement, ‘two elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of
constituent elements of the work that are original.’ "" Williams v. Crichton , 84 F.3d 581 , 587 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting Feist
Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) ). Defendants move for
summary judgment on the first prong, arguing that (1) Plaintiff has not demonstrated he registered his copyright in the
Photograph, and (2) the Photograph is not sufficiently original to qualify as copyrightable. Def. Mem. at 8-13. Plaintiff moves
‘or summary judgment on both prongs. Pl. Mem. at 8-13.

A. Registration

Under 17 U.S.C. § 410(c), a certificate of registration from the United States Register of Copyrights constitutes prima facie
evidence of the valid ownership of a copyright. Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony Records__ 351 F.3d 46 , 51 (2d Cir. 2003). A plaintiff
must demonstrate that a work is protected by a copyright registration. Mantel v. Microsoft Corp. , No. 16 Civ. 5277, 2018 WL
1602863, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2018). Once registration is established, the burden shifts to the defendant to challenge
he validity of that registration. Fonar Corp. v. Domenick , 105 F.3d 99 , 104 (2d Cir. 1997).

Here, it is impossible to tell from the face of the Registration if it covers the Photograph. ECF No. 43-4; Def. 56.1 Stmt. at
13. Richard Leibowitz, then Plaintiff's attorney, submitted a declaration, stating that it is his firm's ""routine practice"" to
register its clients’ photographs with the Copyright Office, that he directly supervises the support staff that handles the
copyright registration process, including Donna Halperin, that the ""content title of the Photograph, as listed on the face of the
Registration], is ""Emily Ratajkowski20190913_0005.jpg,"" and that registration

563 F.Supp.3d 124]

of the Photograph was carried out ""in accordance with [the firm's] routine practice."" Leibowitz Decl. ¥§ 5-10. Although
Plaintiff's briefing and 56.1 statement cite a declaration from Donna Halperin, no such document was filed on the docket.
See Pl. Mem. at 10, 26; Pl. 56.1 Stmt. 66, 68-69, 71-72. It also appears that Leibowitz does not have direct knowledge
of the registration, see Leibowitz Decl., and, in the past, has stated that he ""did not play any role in the filing"" of an
application done by the internal staff, Usherson v. Bandshell Artist Mgmt. , No. 19 Civ. 6368 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2020), ECF
No. 63 4 13. Moreover, the Photograph is not the only file in the Registration. The Court, therefore, cannot discern if it is
covered by reviewing the Registration. See lantosca v. Elie Tahari, Ltd. , No. 19 Civ. 4527, 2020 WL 5603538, at *4
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 18, 2020). Nor did Plaintiff personally apply for registration, permitting the Court to rely on his testimony.
Masi v. Moguldom Media Grp. LLC , No. 18 Civ. 2402, 2019 WL 3287819, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2019) (""Given [p]laintiff's
sworn declaration, and deposition testimony that he included all 45 of the high resolution photos that appeared in his gallery
with his registration application, [djefendant's speculative statements regarding the scope of the copyright do not create a
triable issue of fact as to whether the [registration covers the photographs at issue."" (citations omitted)). The Court,
therefore, cannot find that Plaintiff submitted sufficient ""hard evidence"" with his briefing to demonstrate registration. Mantel,
2018 WL 1602863, at *3 ; Ferdman v. CBS Interactive Inc. , 342 F. Supp. 3d 515, 530 (S.D.N.Y. 2018).

However, after the close of summary judgment briefing, Plaintiff's counsel requested that the Court take judicial notice of a
certified deposit copy he had requested from the Copyright Office. ECF No. 52. His initial letter to the Court, dated
November 24, 2020, consisted of (1) a copy of the certificate from the Copyright Office stating that ""the attached flash drive
is a true copy of the work"" deposited with the Copyright Office under the Registration, (2) an image of a flash drive labelled
with the registration number, and (3) a copy of the Photograph. ECF No. 52-1. Defendants oppose such notice, arguing that
the documents should have been produced during discovery, and Plaintiff had failed to authenticate the copy of the
Photograph as a file on the flash drive and the flash drive as the drive sent with the certificate. ECF No. 53. Plaintiff's reply,
filed on December 9, 2020, a day late, includes a declaration demonstrating that the copy of the Photograph corresponds to
a file saved on the flash drive, and the flash drive was sent from the Copyright Office. ECF No. 55. Defendants object to the
late reply. ECF No. 56.



--- Page 3 ---
The Court concludes that it will permit the one-day late reply and take judicial notice of the deposit copy. Although the
extension request was not made in compliance with the Court's Individual Practices in Civil Cases, the Court recognizes the
administrative burden caused by a sudden influx of cases due to Richard Leibowitz's suspension, ECF Nos. 55, 57, and,
therefore, finds good cause for the late submission. And, under Federal Rule of Evidence 201 (b), the Court may take judicial
notice of public documents such as certifications from the Copyright Office at any point in a litigation, including after the
completion of summary judgment briefing. Fed. R. Evid. 201(d) ; /sland Software & Comput. Serv., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.
413 F.3d 257 , 261 (2d Cir. 2005) ; Otto v. Hearst Commc'ns, Inc. , 345 F. Supp. 3d 412, 424 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). Moreover,
Plaintiff's counsel's declaration sufficiently authenticates the deposit copy.

[563 F.Supp.3d 125]

ECF Nos. 55-2-55-8; CU Prods. LLC v. BTC Enters. LLC , No. 10 Civ. 5878, 2012 WL 1999829, at *6 & n.6 (S.D.N.Y. June
1, 2012). And, as opposed to Mantel and Ferdman, discovery sanctions are not appropriate. Here, Plaintiff did not have the
deposit copy in his possession during discovery; thus, he did not violate discovery rules by not producing it. ECF No. 39 at
37, 42; c f. Mantel, 2018 WL 1602863, at *4 (""Plaintiff represented that he had these documents in his possession ...
[p]laintiff told the [dJefendants that he would produce the documents to them.""); Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 526-27, 529-
30 (noting that plaintiff attached documents to his summary judgment briefing that had previously been requested and which
he had represented he did not possess); see also CJ Prods. LLC , 2012 WL 1999829, at *6 (""[S]ince this litigation is a
search for the truth, defendants cannot be prejudiced by the materials."").

With the deposit copy before the Court, Plaintiff has established that the Photograph is registered with the Copyright Office.
As Defendants do not otherwise challenge the validity of the Registration, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has
demonstrated prima facie evidence of valid copyright ownership. See lantosca , 2020 WL 5603538, at “5.

B. Originality

Defendant attempts to rebut the presumption created by the Registration by arguing that the Photograph is insufficiently
original. Def. Mem. at 10-13. ""To qualify for copyright protection, a work must be original to the author."" Feist Publ'ns., Inc._.
499 U.S. at 345 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 . An original work is one that ""was independently created by the author"" and ""possesses at
least some minimal degree of creativity."" /d. ""Almost any photograph may claim the necessary originality to support a
copyright,"" as long as there is some originality in ""rendition ... timing ... [or] creation of the subject."" Mannion v. Coors
Brewing Co. , 377 F. Supp. 2d 444 , 450, 452-55 (S.D.N.Y. 2005).

Courts have found paparazzi photographs original based on their ""myriad creative choices, including, for example, their
lighting, angle, and focus."" Sands v. CBS Interactive Inc. , No. 18 Civ. 7345, 2019 WL 1447014, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13,
2019). Here, too, the Photograph meets the ""extremely low"" standard for originality. Feist,499 U.S. at 345 , 111 S.Ct. 1282 ;
cf. Bridgeman Art Libr., Ltd. v. Corel Corp. , 36 F. Supp. 2d 191 , 196-97 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (finding unoriginal ""slavish copies""
consisting of photographs of an existing photograph meant to directly reproduce the existing work); Oriental Art Printing, Inc.
v. Goldstar Printing Corp. . 175 F. Supp. 2d 542 , 556-57 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (finding unoriginal ""direct depictions of the most
common Chinese food dishes as they appear on the plates served to customers at restaurants,"" with no evidence that the
photographs were ""designed with creativity or art in mind,"" rather than ""serv[ing] a purely utilitarian purpose"" of identifying
the dishes on a takeout menu), aff'd in part, appeal dismissed in part sub nom. Oriental Art Printing Inc. v. GS Printing Corp.
, 34 F. App'x 401 (2d Cir. 2002). Plaintiff selected his location, lighting, equipment, and settings based on the location and
timing. Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 8; Pl. 56.1 Stmt. § 21. Moreover, that other photographers took photographs of the same subject
matter at the same time does not make the Photograph less original; copyright protects an author's specific expression
capturing a subject, even if others capture the subject as well. Cf. Mannion._377 F. Supp. 2d at 453 (noting that if another
photographer captured the same scene as a copyrighted image, it would not infringe the original image). Therefore, the
Photograph

[563 F.Supp.3d 126]

has sufficient originality to be copyrighted. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the validity of
Plaintiff's copyright is DENIED.

Thus, Plaintiff has demonstrated that he owns a valid copyright in the Photograph. Plaintiff has also established that
Ratajkowski copied the Photograph. See Williams, 84 F.3d at 587 (""In the absence of direct evidence, copying is proven by
showing (a) that the defendant had access to the copyrighted work[,] and (b) the substantial similarity of protectible material
in the two works."" (quotation marks and citation omitted)); Pl. 56.1 Stmt. (26, 30-31. Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion for
summary judgment regarding Ratajkowski's infringement is GRANTED.

Cc. Emrata

Defendants move for summary judgment dismissing all claims against Emrata. Def. Mem. at 2 n.2. Plaintiff has indicated his
intent to dismiss Emrata, ECF No. 28 at 1, but has not done so formally. Plaintiff has not demonstrated Emrata's liability: it is
undisputed that Ratajkowski posts on the Instagram Account in her personal capacity, Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 2, and Plaintiff has
demonstrated no facts linking Emrata to the copying of the Photograph. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment as to Emrata is GRANTED.


--- Page 4 ---
Ill. Damages

Defendants contend that Plaintiff's claim fails because he cannot establish he is owed money damages. Def. Mem. at 18-
23. The Copyright Act provides that a copyright plaintiff may recover either actual damages or statutory damages. 17 U.S.C.
§ 504. Plaintiff stated in his supplemental disclosures that he is no longer seeking actual damages, ECF No. 39 at 42, nor
does he argue for actual damages in this briefing, see Pl. Mem; PI. Reply at 9-10, ECF No. 51. Therefore, the Court shall
only consider whether he is due statutory damages.

The Copyright Act permits statutory damages of between $750 and $30,000 per infringement, and up to $150,000 if such
infringement was ""willful[ ]."" 17 U.S.C. § 504(c). However, statutory damages may not be awarded for infringement of ""an
unpublished work commenced before the effective date of its registration,"" or ""commenced after first publication of the work
and before the effective date of its registration, unless such registration is made within three months after the first publication
of the work."" 17 U.S.C. § 412 ; see also Troll Co. v. Uneeda Doll Co. , 483 F.3d 150 , 158 (2d Cir. 2007).

Defendants argue that because the Photograph was only posted to Splash, it was not published within the meaning of §
412. Def. Mem. at 21; Def. Opp'n at 19-20, ECF No. 50. The Copyright Act defines publication in relevant part as ""the
distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending"" or ""[t]he offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution[.]"" 17
U.S.C. § 101. The Copyright Office, whose opinion merits deference, further explains that publication occurs where ""the
offeror""—the copyright owner or someone with their authority—""has completed all the steps necessary for distribution to the
public, such that the only further action required is an offeree's action in obtaining a copy or phonorecord[,]"" but not where
""distribution of copies or phonorecords requires additional action by the offeror."" U.S. Copyright Office, Compendium of U.S.

Palmer/Kane LLC v. Gareth Stevens Publ'g , No. 15 Civ. 7404, 2017 WL 3973957, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2017).
Therefore, Splash's offering the Photograph to its subscribers for the purposes of licensing, carried out with Plaintiff's
authority, constitutes publication. Palmer/Kane LLC , 2017 WL 3973957, at *11 ; see also Copyright Compendium § 1906.1
(giving as examples of publication an offer by a copyright owner ""on a public website to purchase and download an app that
they developed and made accessible on that website"" and ""[a]n advertisement containing pictures of a jewelry design"").

Defendants further argue that Splash's thumbnail postings were merely ""samples"", which the Second Circuit in Hub Floral
Corp. v. Royal Brass Corp. . 454 F.2d 1226 (2d Cir. 1972) , recognized as insufficient for publication. Def. Opp'n at 20.
However, in Hub Floral , the Second Circuit noted that the full work of the distributed samples—fabric patterns—had not yet
been produced, and so, ""[s]ince [the copyright holder] was not in a position to commence realizing the benefits of its unique
design and the public had not been provided with reproductions, there was no publication."" /d. at 1229. The logical inference
of this holding is that if ""the samples had been sold or delivered to customers, it would have been deemed publication."" Gold
Value Int'l Texile, Inc. v. Sanctuary Clothing, LLC , No. 16 Civ. 339, 2017 WL 2903180, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2017).

Here, however, Plaintiff was in a position to immediately realize the benefits of the Photograph, and in fact, Plaintiff earned
income on the Photograph between September 13 and 19, 2021. O'Neil Dep. Tr. at 80:25-81:4; see Gold Value Int'l Texile,
Inc. , 2017 WL 2903180, at *7 (noting that plaintiff's exhibiting smaller images of its designs in books available at its studios ""
[gave] customers not only the ability to view the designs, but also the ability to acquire them"" thereby ""showing a willingness
to enter into a bargain, such that any reasonable customer would understand the product as being offered to him or her for
sale"" (quoting Urb. Textile, Inc. v. Cato Corp. , No. 14 Civ. 6967, 2016 WL 6804911, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2016) )); see
also Copyright Compendium § 1906.1 (""Publication occurs when fabric, carpet, or wallpaper samples are offered to sales
representatives for the purpose of selling those works to wholesalers and retailers.""). Moreover, although Splash's
viewership is limited to its subscribers, ECF No. 49-3, that membership is a far cry from the ""few trusted customers"" deemed
too small a viewership for publication. Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Dan River Mills, Inc. ,295 F. Supp. 1366 , 1368 (S.D.N.Y.),
aff'd__ 415 F.2d 1007 (2d Cir. 1969) .

The Court concludes, therefore, that the Photograph was published when posted on Splash on September 13, 2019. ECF
No. 43-2. And, because the Registration's effective date—October 3, 2019—is within three months of the Photograph's
publication, statutory damages are permitted for Ratajkowski's infringement, which occurred on September 18, 2019,
between publication and the effective date of registration. 17 U.S.C. § 412(2) ; Registration; Pl. 56.1 Stmt. 4 25.

Moreover, Plaintiff may recover statutory damages despite earning only negligible profits from the Photograph, and, thus,
suffering only minimal actual damages. Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 9; O'Neil Dep. Tr. at 80:25-80:4; see Agence France Presse v.
Morel , No. 10 Civ. 2730, 2014 WL 3963124, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2014) (citing Psihoyos v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc._,
748 F.3d 120 , 127 (2d Cir. 2014) ). Although courts are discouraged from awarding windfall statutory damages to plaintiffs,
actual damages are only one

[563 F.Supp.3d 128]

factor courts consider in determining statutory damages. Cengage Learning, Inc. v. Yousuf, No. 14 Civ. 3174, 2018 WL


--- Page 5 ---
6990757, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 20, 2018), report and recommendation adopted , No. 14 Civ. 3174, 2019 WL 162661
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10, 2019) ; Agence France Presse , 2014 WL 3963124, at *15. Therefore, although the Court does not opine
on the amount of statutory damages Plaintiff may be due if he prevails at trial, the lack of actual damages does not foreclose
his pursuit of statutory damages.

Accordingly, Plaintiff is not barred from recovering statutory damages for the infringement, and the Court does not reach the
issue of whether his being barred would make summary judgment appropriate. Defendants’ motion for summary judgment
based on lack of damages is, therefore, DENIED.

IV. Fair Use

Plaintiff and Defendants cross-move for summary judgment on whether the posting of the Instagram Photograph was fair
use. Fair use, an affirmative defense to copyright infringement, seeks to balance copyright protections and ""the ability of
[other] authors, artists, and the rest of us to express them—or ourselves by reference to the works of others,"" Andy Warhol
Found. for Visual Arts. Inc. v. Goldsmith , 11 F.4th 26 , 36 (2d Cir. 2021) (alteration in original) (quotingBlanch v. Koons
467 F.3d 244 , 250 (2d Cir. 2006) ), in order to uphold copyright law's ultimate purpose of ""promot[ing] the Progress of
Science and useful Arts,"" U.S. Const. art. |, § 8, cl. 8.

The Copyright Act lists four non-exhaustive factors that courts should consider when evaluating where a use is ""fair"":

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. § 107. In weighing these factors, the Court should conduct a ""holistic, context-sensitive inquiry"" without bright-line
rules. Andy Warhol Found.__11 F.4th at 37 .

""Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact."" Harper & Row. Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105
S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . However, the Second Circuit has resolved questions of fair use at the summary
judgment stage where the moving party shows there are no genuine issues of material fact. Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 426
(citing Wright v. Warner Books, Inc. , 953 F.2d 731 , 735 (2d Cir. 1991) ). Because fair use is an affirmative defense, on
which the defendant bears the burden at trial, when a plaintiff challenges it on summary judgment he ""may satisfy [his] Rule
56 burden by showing that there is an absence of evidence to support an essential element of the non-moving party's case.""
F.D.1.C. v. Giammettei_, 34 F.3d 51 , 54 (2d Cir. 1994) (citing Celotex , 477 U.S. at 325 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 ).

A. Purpose and Character of the Work
1. Transformative Work

The first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the work, focuses primarily on whether the use is ""transformative""—
that is, ""whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something

[563 F.Supp.3d 129]

new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message."" Andy Warhol
Found._, 11 F.4th at 37 (quoting_ Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994) ). The ""[p]aradigmatic examples"" of such transformative uses are those listed in the preamble to § 107 : ""criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching ..., scholarship, or research."" /d. (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 107 ). The Court conducts this
inquiry objectively, considering how the new use ""may reasonably be perceived"" without concern for the infringer's
subjective intent. /d. at 50 (quotation marks and citation omitted); Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 707 (2d Cir. 2013).

Another court in this district has determined that the purpose of paparazzi photos is to ""document the comings and goings of
celebrities, illustrate their fashion and lifestyle choices, and accompany gossip and news articles about their lives."" Barcroft
Media, Ltd. v. Coed Media Group, LLC , 297 F. Supp. 3d 339, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). Therefore, when news sites have copied
paparazzi photographs to document celebrities’ lives, courts have determined those uses are not transformative. /d. ; cf.
Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 534. By contrast, where photographs are used to comment on the image—rather than to
illustrate an independent news story—courts have found those uses to be transformative. Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at
534-35 ; Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 352 (""Display of a copyrighted image or video may be transformative where the use
serves to illustrate criticism, commentary, or a news story about that work."" (emphasis in original)); see also Monge v. Maya
Mags.. Inc. , 688 F.3d 1164 , 1174-76 (9th Cir. 2012). Defendants contend that, by placing the words ""mood forever"" on the
Photograph to post it to her Instagram Stories, the Instagram Photograph ""ma[de] commentary and criticism of
[Ratajkowski's] perspective of abusive, aggressive, and harassing practice of paparazzi constantly following her, even when



--- Page 6 ---
buying flowers for a friend."" Def. Mem. at 16.

The Court concludes that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether, and to what extent, Ratajkowski's use
was transformative. A reasonable observer could conclude the Instagram Photograph merely showcases Ratajkowski's
clothes, location, and pose at that time—the same purpose, effectively, as the Photograph. On the other hand, it is possible
a reasonable observer could also conclude that, given the flowers covering Ratajkowski's face and body and the text ""mood
forever,"" the Instagram Photograph instead conveyed that Ratajkowski's ""mood forever"" was her attempt to hide from the
encroaching eyes of the paparazzi—a commentary on the Photograph. See Ratajkowski Dep. Tr. at 39:21—23 (noting that
""mood is a millennial way of using an expression or an image to express how someone feels about something""). And, the
Court declines to opine on the newsworthiness of Ratajkowski's battles with paparazzi compared to other events the
documentation of which courts have found to be fair use. Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 535.

2. Commerciality

The first fair use prong also requires an analysis of whether the use was commercial. This inquiry does not turn on whether
a defendant's business is for-profit_Am. Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc. , 60 F.3d 913 , 921 (2d Cir. 1994), nor whether
""the sole motive of the use is monetary gain,"" Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 429 (quoting Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562 , 105
S.Ct. 2218 ). Instead, ""[t]he crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is ... whether the user stands to profit from

[563 F.Supp.3d 130]

exploitation of copyrighted material without paying the customary price."" /d. (quoting Harper & Row._471 U.S. at 562 , 105
S.Ct. 2218 ). ""The greater the private economic rewards reaped by the secondary user (to the exclusion of broader public
benefits), the more likely the first factor will favor the copyright holder."" Am. Geophysical Union__60 F.3d at 922 ; Assoc.
Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings , 931 F. Supp. 2d 537 , 552 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (""Where a defendant did not gain ‘direct or
immediate commercial advantage’ from the copying, its status as a for-profit enterprise is less relevant."" (quoting Am.
Geophysical Union__60 F.3d at 921 )). Conversely, where a use only ""trivially affected"" the value of a for-profit service, this
actor is assigned relatively little weight_Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. . 756 F.3d 73 , 83 (2d Cir. 2014).
Moreover, the more transformative the new work, ""the less will be the significance of ... commercialism."" Cariou., 714 F.3d at
708 ; see also Authors Guild v. Google. Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 223 (2d Cir. 2015).

Here, Ratajkowski has a link to her for-profit store on the Instagram Account main feed, though it was not visible when
viewing the Instagram Photograph. PI. 56.1 Stmt. § 57; Instagram Photograph. Ratajkowski estimates she has made more
han $100,000 from the Instagram Stories section of the Instagram Account within the last three years, although posting
sponsored posts to Instagram Stories is less common than to her main feed. PI. 56.1 Stmt. § 56; Ratajkowski Dep Tr. at
50:12-14. Therefore, the Instagram Account is, at least in part, a for-profit enterprise, including the Instagram Stories
portion.

However, Ratajkowski did not ""directly and exclusively acquire[ ] conspicuous financial rewards from [her] use of the
copyrighted material,"" as she was not paid to post this particular story. Am. Geophysical Union__60 F.3d at 922 ; Ratajkowski
Dep Tr. at 44:22-24 (""Q. Ms. Ratajkowski, did you get paid for using this photograph on your Instagram story? A. No.""). Nor
was the infringed work displayed directly next to advertisements, or in a section almost exclusively meant for
advertisements. See Hirsch v. Complex Media, Inc. , No. 18 Civ. 5488, 2018 WL 6985227, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 2018) ;
Richard Feiner & Co., Inc. v. H.R. Industries, Inc. , 10 F. Supp. 2d 310 , 314 (S.D.N.Y. 1998), rev'd on other grounds_, 182
F.3d 901 (2d Cir. 1999) . A non-sponsored Instagram Story—one of the approximately five a day Ratajkowski posted, PI.
56.1 Stmt. § 43—would have only trivially affected the value of the Instagram Account. Therefore, though the use is slightly
commercial, the Court affords this factor little weight. Moreover, if a jury were to determine this use was transformative, this
factor should be weighed even less. Cariou_, 714 F.3d at 708 .

3. Bad Faith

Last, the Court considers Ratajkowski's ""good or bad faith"" in infringing in the first factor analysis. NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst.
364 F.3d 471 , 478 (2d Cir. 2004). A finding of bad faith is not dispositive, either of the first factor or of fair use in general.
Id. at 479 ; Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 429 n.3. Plaintiff argues that Ratajkowski's use was in bad faith because of her
""omission of any credit,"" and her not paying a license fee despite knowing that celebrities occasionally license photographs
from Splash. PI. Mem. at 19.

Although Ratajkowski rarely credits photographers, Pl. 56.1 Stmt. § 51, there is no evidence that she personally removed
copyright attribution from the Photograph, Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 537 (finding no bad faith where there was ""no
evidence that [djefendant ... removed the authorship credit itself""), cf.

[563 F.Supp.3d 131]

Yang v. Mic Network, Inc. , 405 F. Supp. 3d 537, 546 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (holding that the defendant ""cut[ting] off part of the
[p]hotograph, removing the label crediting the work to [p]laintiff,"" was bad faith), reconsideration denied , No. 18 Civ. 7628,
2020 WL 6562403 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2020).


--- Page 7 ---
Additionally, if Ratajkowski did know that her ""access to the [Photograph] was unauthorized or was derived from a violation
of law or breach of duty, this consideration weighs in favor of [P]laintiff[ ]."" NX/VM Corp.__364 F.3d at 478 . However, there is
no evidence that Ratajkowski knew the Photograph was copyrighted or who it was copyrighted by. She testified that she did
not take the Photograph directly from Splash, which makes her knowledge of other celebrities’ licensing from Splash
irrelevant. Ratajkowski Dep. Tr. at 69:2—3; Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 537. And her awareness that paparazzi
photographs have been the basis of lawsuits against celebrities, PI. 56.1 Stmt. 4 61-62, and general ""internet etiquette""
that ""people will share [her] images and [she] share[s] their images,"" id. | 49; Ratajkowski Dep. Tr. at 24:13-21, does not
demonstrate specific knowledge about the Photograph or Instagram Stories. Moreover, if a use otherwise meets the fair use
criteria, ""lack of permission is beside the point."" Wright v. Warner Books, Inc. , 953 F.2d 731 , 737 (2d Cir. 1991) (quotation
marks omitted). Therefore, the Court concludes this sub-factor does not weigh heavily in either direction.

In sum, therefore, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Ratajkowski's use was transformative, and neither
commerciality nor bad faith weigh heavily on the analysis—particularly if the use is deemed transformative. Therefore, the
Court cannot determine this factor at the summary judgment stage. Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 536 (""Where ...
reasonable jurors could disagree about whether—or the extent to which—a use is transformative, it is appropriate to deny
summary judgment on a fair use defense.""); Sar! Louis Feraud Int'l v. Viewfinder Inc. , 627 F. Supp. 2d 123 , 131 (S.D.N.Y.
2008).

B. Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second fair use factor requires the Court to consider the ""nature of the copyrighted work,"" including whether (1) it is
""expressive or creative ... or more factual, with a greater leeway being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work is
factual or informational,"" and (2) ""the work is published or unpublished, with the scope of fair use involving unpublished
works being considerably narrower."" Andy Warhol Found.__11 F.4th at 45 (citation omitted).

This factor weighs in favor of Plaintiff, but only marginally so. The Photograph is ""essentially factual in nature"" and Plaintiff
""captured [his] subject[ ] in public, as [she] naturally appeared, and [was] not tasked with directing the subject{ ], altering the
backdrops, or otherwise doing much to impose creative force on the [Photograph] or infuse the [Photograph] with [his] own
artistic vision."" Barcroft , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 354. Moreover, as determined above, the Photograph was published.

C. Amount and Substantiality of the Use

In assessing the third fair use factor, the Court considers the amount and substantiality of the portion of the copyrighted
work used. This factor considers not only ""the quantity of the materials used"" but also ""their quality and importance"" in
relation to the original work. TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 839 F.3d 168 , 185 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Campbell 510
U.S. at 587 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). Because of this relational analysis, the Second

[563 F.Supp.3d 132]

Circuit has rejected the proposition that ""this factor necessarily favors the copyright holder even where the secondary user
has copied the primary work in toto in service of a legitimate secondary purpose."" Andy Warhol Found._, 11 F.4th at 46 .""
[T]his factor ‘weighs less when considering a photograph—where all or most of the work often must be used in order to
preserve any meaning at all—than a work such as a text or musical composition, where bits and pieces can be excerpted
without losing all value.’ "" Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 539 (quoting N. Jersey Media Grp. Inc. v. Pirro , 74 F. Supp. 3d 605,
621 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) ).

Ratajkowski took the vast majority, if not the entirety, of the Photograph. Def. 56.1 Stmt. at 12; Pl. 56.1 Stmt. 4 31. In order
to meaningfully comment on the intrusiveness of the Photograph—her stated purpose—she would require enough of the
Photograph for it to be identifiable as a paparazzi photograph. Although this would arguably not require the whole
Photograph, it would undoubtedly require the heart of the Photograph—the image of Ratajkowski and enough of its
background to place her on a city street.

Defendants argue that by posting the Instagram Photograph on Instagram Stories, rather than the main account, the use
was less substantial. Def. Mem. at 17. The Court is not aware of any other court that has considered the impact of a social
media ""stories"" post compared to a static post. On the one hand, courts in general do not take into account the length of
availability of the infringing work. And, it does not counteract Ratajkowski's usage of the entire photograph, for a full twenty-
four hours. Cf. Hirsch , 2018 WL 6985227, at *7 (finding this prong weighed against a reproduction of an entire photograph
for two seconds when defendant could have displayed a headline for the same effect).

However, the Supreme Court has observed that, ""[t]he facts bearing on [the third] factor will also tend to address the fourth,
by revealing the degree to which the [secondary use] may serve as a market substitute for the original or potentially licensed
derivatives."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 587 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . If the Instagram Photograph only appeared for twenty-four hours,
it is much less likely that someone might take the Photograph from the Instagram Account rather than licensing it from
Plaintiff, compared to that same risk if the Instagram Photograph was permanently on the Instagram Account. Moreover,
assuming Ratajkowski wished to critique paparazzi, she chose the comparatively insubstantial option of Instagram Stories
rather than the Instagram Account main feed.

The Court concludes, therefore, that, because Ratajkowski used a greater portion of the Photograph than was necessary for


--- Page 8 ---
her purpose, this factor weighs slightly in favor of Plaintiff. However, the fact that it was posted on Instagram Stories lessens
that weight. 2

[563 F.Supp.3d 133]
D. Effect on the Market

Finally, the fourth factor considers the secondary usage's effect on the original work's market. This factor focuses on
""whether the copy brings to the marketplace a competing substitute for the original, or its derivative, so as to deprive the
rights holder of significant revenues because of the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in
preference to the original."" Authors Guild__804 F.3d at 222 . In addition, the Court considers ""whether, if the challenged use
becomes widespread, it will adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work."" Andy Warhol Found.__11 F.4th at
48 (citation omitted). This consideration covers ""traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets."" Am. Geophysical
Union__60 F.3d at 930 ; see also Andy Warhol Found.__11 F.4th at 48-49 . There is a ""close linkage between the first and
ourth factors,"" because ""the more the copying is done to achieve a purpose that differs from the purpose of the original, the
less likely it is that the copy will serve as a satisfactory substitute for the original."" Authors Guild _, 804 F.3d at 223 . The
plaintiff is required to identify relevant markets, but, because fair use is an affirmative defense, the plaintiff need not show
actual market harm. Andy Warhol Found.__11 F.4th at 48-49 . Moreover, where a court determines a use is not
ransformative, but rather that it is a ""mere duplication for commercial purposes,"" there is a presumption of market harm.
Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 541 (quoting Campbell__510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

To prevail on this factor in his motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff must show that, even if the Photograph is deemed
ransformative, a market exists which would be affected if this manner of using the Photograph became widespread. See
Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 258 n.9 (2d Cir. 2006) (concluding this factor weighed for fair use where ""nothing in the
record here suggests that there was a derivative market for [plaintiff] to tap into that is in any way related to [defendant's] use
of her work, even if she dearly wanted to""). For Defendants to prevail on this factor in their motion for summary judgment,
hey must demonstrate that even if the Photograph is deemed non-transformative, the presumption of market harm is
overcome by evidence that the relevant market has not been harmed and would not be harmed should the usage become
widespread. McGucken v. Newsweek LLC , 464 F. Supp. 3d 594, 609 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), reconsideration denied , No. 19 Civ.
9617, 2020 WL 6135733 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2020).

Here, the relevant market is that of individuals licensing photographs from paparazzi—whether through agencies such as
Splash or directly from the photographers—in order to post the photographs on the individuals’ social media accounts. As
here is no information in the record regarding that market, the Court cannot rule on this factor at this juncture. Although
photographs posted on Splash are licensed to ""third parties including media outlets such as New York Post, People
Magazine and E! Online and other third-party users,"" that establishes only a market of licensing the photographs to news
organizations, not individuals. Pl. 56.1 Stmt. 7; see also Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 541 (noting that defendant's use of
celebrity photographs taken by paparazzi in a media outlet is ""paradigmatic of the only market the photographs could
reasonably have: licensing to media outfits""); Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 432-33 (noting ""media outlets"" as a market).
Defendants argue that there is no market for the Photograph because Ratajkowski's face is covered and Plaintiff failed to
make money from the licensing of the Photograph. Def.

[563 F.Supp.3d 134]

Mem. at 18. But, Defendants have not established that the market generally does not exist, or that Plaintiff could not extend
into it should he choose. Defendants, therefore, have not adduced evidence which rebuts the presumption of market harm.
Cf. Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 432 (noting that a lack of actual sales of the work at issue did not preclude market harm), O'Neil
Dep. Tr. at 80:25-81:11 (stating that Plaintiff did receive income from licensing the Photograph, though not identifying the
source).

E. Weighing the Factors

In sum, there are material issues of fact with respect to the first and fourth factors, and the second and third factors weigh
towards Plaintiff, though not strongly. The Court cannot, therefore, make a determination of fair use on summary judgment.
Accordingly, both parties’ motions for summary judgment on the issue of fair use are DENIED.

V. Other Affirmative Defenses

Defendants assert thirteen affirmative defenses in addition to fair use. ECF No. 17 at 4—7. Plaintiff moves for dismissal as a
matter of law on the defenses to liability: failure to state a claim; invalidity or unenforceability of copyright; scénes a faire and
merger doctrines; estoppel; waiver; copyright misuse; unclean hands; authorized use, license, consent, or acquiescence;
non-infringement; and constitutional defenses. PI. Mem. at 2, 23-28.

A. Failure to State a Claim and Ownership

A complaint must plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550
U.S. 544 , 570,127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) . ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual
content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.""



--- Page 9 ---
Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) . Here, Plaintiff alleges that he is the author
of the Photograph, that he registered it—creating a presumptively valid copyright—and that Defendants posted the
Photograph on Instagram without authorization. ECF No. 1 §{ 9-12. Although bare bones, the Court cannot conclude that
this is insufficient to state a claim, and Defendants have not made a substantive argument other than those resolved above
in Part Il.

Similarly, Plaintiff has made out a case of ownership of a valid copyright. Supra Pt. Il. Moreover, Defendants do not argue
that either the scénes a faire or merger doctrines apply separately from her argument regarding lack of originality, which the
Court rejected above. See Def. Opp'n at 15-16.

B. Estoppel and Waiver

Defendants argue that the affirmative defenses of estoppel and waiver apply because Plaintiff took Ratajkowski's
photograph without her consent and attempted to use that photograph to exploit her fame and notoriety; without
Ratajkowski's image, he would have no image to attempt to license. Def. Opp'n at 17.

In order to demonstrate the estoppel defense applies, Defendants must show that ""1) the plaintiff had knowledge of
defendant's infringing acts, 2) the plaintiff either intended that defendant rely on his acts or omissions or acted or failed to
act in such a manner that defendant had a right to believe that it was intended to rely on plaintiff's conduct, 3) the defendant
was ignorant of the true facts, and 4) the defendant relied on plaintiff's conduct to its detriment."" Dallal v. The New York
Times Co. , No. 05-2924, 2006 WL 463386, at *1 (2d Cir. Feb. 17, 2006). Ratajkowski does

[563 F.Supp.3d 135]

not claim that she had a right to rely on a particular affirmative action of Plaintiff. See Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.
572 U.S. 663 , 684, 134 S.Ct. 1962 , 188 L.Ed.2d 979 (2014) (holding estoppel available when ""a copyright owner engages
in intentionally misleading representations concerning his abstention from suit""); Coach, Inc. v. Kmart Corps. . 756 F. Supp.
2d 421 , 426 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (""[A]n essential element of estoppel [is] that the party who invokes it shall have acted to his
detriment in reliance upon what the other party had done."" (quotation marks and citation omitted)). Taking a photograph of
someone does not constitute as an action indicating permission to use the photograph. Nor do Defendants point to any
reliance on Ratajkowski's part. See Flo & Eddie, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio Inc. , 80 F. Supp. 3d 535, 541 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).

In order to establish waiver under New York law, defendant must show ""intentional relinquishment of a known right with both
knowledge of its existence and an intention to relinquish it."" /d. at 540 (quoting_Capito/ Records, Inc. v. Naxos of Am.. Inc.
372 F.3d 471 , 482 (2d Cir. 2004) (emphasis omitted)). ""The conduct constituting a waiver must be clear, unmistakable and
without ambiguity.” /d. (quotation marks and citation omitted). Defendants do not explain, much less give evidence in the
record, how Ratajkowski's being the subject of the Photograph constitutes conduct by Plaintiff clearly demonstrating an
intentional and knowing relinquishment of rights.

C. Copyright Misuse and Unclean Hands

Defendants claim entitlement to the defenses of copyright misuse, unclean hands, and bad faith based on Plaintiff's
allegedly bringing a case knowing that his statutory damages were disproportionate to the cost of litigation, and Plaintiff's
counsel's track record of ""launching full scale and excessive litigation merely to extort exorbitant settlements over negligible
infringement."" Def. Opp'n at 17-18.

The defense of copyright misuse ""has not been firmly established in the Second Circuit and it is unclear whether an antitrust
violation is required for its use."" Michael Grecco Prods., Inc. v. Valuewalk, LLC , 345 F. Supp. 3d 482, 510 (S.D.N.Y. 2018).
Generally, it ""bars copyright owners from recovering for infringement where they have extended the scope of their copyrights
to control areas outside of their copyright monopoly."" Coach, Inc.__756 F. Supp. 2d at 428 ; see also Michael Grecco Prods. ,
345 F. Supp. 3d at 510 (describing the Fourth Circuit doctrine as applying where ""the copyright is being used in a manner
violative of the public policy embodied in the grant of a copyright{[.]"" (citation omitted)). Therefore, the Seventh Circuit has
stated that copyright misuse may be expanded outside the bounds of antitrust because ""for a copyright owner to use an
infringement suit to obtain property protection ... that copyright law clearly does not confer, hoping to force a settlement or
even achieve an outright victory over an opponent that may lack the resources or the legal sophistication to resist

effectively, is an abuse of process."" Assessment Techs. of WI, LLC v. WiREdata, Inc. 350 F.3d 640 , 647 (7th Cir. 2003) ;
see also AF Holdings, LLC v. Olivas , No. 12 Civ. 1401, 2013 WL 4456643, at *3 (D. Conn. Aug. 16, 2013) (""[A] pattern of
unsubstantiated, virtually identical suits followed by [p]laintiff's solicitation of settlement ... may support a copyright misuse
claim."" (emphasis added)). However, ""the predicate for a misuse defense is an attempt to use the copyright monopoly to
control something the monopoly does not protect.""

[563 F.Supp.3d 136]

Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe , No. 13 Civ. 3648, 2014 WL 2581168, at *2 (N.D. Ill. June 9, 2014). Defendants offer no legal
support for the proposition that a plaintiff's use of process can constitute copyright misuse where he is protecting a legitimate
copyright. Moreover, there is no evidence that, whatever Plaintiff's counsel's practice might be, this case was brought
abusively.


--- Page 10 ---
The unclean hands defense applies where ""a plaintiff otherwise entitled to relief has acted so improperly with respect to the
controversy at bar that the public interest in punishing the plaintiff outweighs the need to prevent defendant's tortious
conduct."" Sands , 2019 WL 1447014, at *4. In copyright actions, the unclean hands defense is recognized ""only rarely, when
the plaintiff's transgression is of serious proportions and relates directly to the subject matter of the infringement action."" /d. ;
see also Specialty Minerals, Inc. v. Pluess-Staufer AG , 395 F. Supp. 2d 109 , 112 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (""The Second Circuit has
repeatedly emphasized the narrowness of the doctrine's application.""). Courts have required ""that the plaintiff either
participated in the acts of infringement or that plaintiff committed some ‘transgression’ such as fraud upon the Copyright
Office resulting in harm or prejudice to the defendant."" Coleman v. ESPN. Inc. , 764 F. Supp. 290 , 296 (S.D.N.Y. 1991).
Alternatively, a plaintiff must have committed ""truly unconscionable and brazen behavior"" such as repeated
misrepresentations to the court and fabrication of testimony, or seeking compensation from a company from which the
plaintiff stole millions of dollars. Unicorn Crowdfunding, Inc. v. New St. Enter., Inc. , 507 F. Supp. 3d 547 (S.D.N.Y. 2020)
(collecting cases). A defendant cannot, however, merely claim that her belief that the plaintiff engaged in misconduct caused
her wrongdoing. Dardashtian v. Gitman , No. 17 Civ. 4327, 2021 WL 746133, at *28 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2021), report and
recommendation adopted , No. 17 Civ. 4327, 2021 WL 1191811 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2021).

Here, there is no evidence of fraud or misrepresentations to the Court, nor that Plaintiff acted outside the scope of his
copyright. The behavior alleged by Defendants, therefore, does not justify the unclean hands defense. See Golden v.
Michael Grecco Prods., Inc. , 524 F.Supp.3d 52, 65 (E.D.N.Y. 2021) (dismissing defense of unclean hands where
counterclaim plaintiffs counsel was considered a ""copyright troll"" in other litigation, a term that refers to someone who
scours the internet for unlicensed use of copyrighted material for the purpose of extracting settlements, because those other
cases were not before the court).

D. License, Non-Infringement, and Constitutional Defenses

Defendants also assert the defense of license or implied license, arguing that Plaintiff ""impliedly or explicitly, directly, or
indirectly, authorized, licensed, consented to, or acquiesced to"" her infringement. ECF No. 17 at 5. ""[T]he party claiming a
license [bears] the burden of coming forward with evidence of one."" Spinelli v. Nat'l Football Leaque , 903 F.3d 185 , 197 (2d
Cir. 2018) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Courts have found an implied license ""where one party created a work at
he other's request and handed it over, intending that the other copy and distribute it."" Solid Oak Sketches, LLC v. 2K
Games, Inc. , 449 F. Supp. 3d 333, 346 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). ""[T]he question comes down to whether there was a ‘meeting of
he minds’ between the parties to permit the particular usage at issue."" Otto , 345 F. Supp. 3d at 434 (alteration in original)
(citation omitted). And, ""[a] plaintiff's acquiescence in the defendant's infringing acts may, if continued for a sufficient period

563 F.Supp.3d 137]

of time and if manifested by overt acts, result in an abandonment of copyright."" Coach, Inc.__756 F. Supp. 2d at 427 .

Here, there is no evidence of a license agreement, or communication between the parties that could give rise to an implied
license. PI. 56.1 Stmt. {| 33-36. Nor is there any record of Plaintiff's knowledge and inaction regarding Ratajkowski's
infringement. Moreover, although Defendants cite the existence of fair use as the reason for a license, license and fair use
are two different defenses: if a use is fair, a license is not required. See Assoc. Press , 931 F. Supp. 2d at 564 .

Finally, Defendants argue that the affirmative defenses of constitutional defenses and non-infringement apply because of fair
use. Because there are issues of material fact regarding fair use, the Court cannot find that either defense fails as a matter
of law. See Twin Peaks Prods., Inc. v. Publications Int'l, Ltd. , 996 F.2d 1366 , 1378 (2d Cir. 1993) (""[T]he fair use doctrine
encompasses all claims of [F]irst [AJmendment in the copyright field[.]"" (quoting New Era Publ'ns Int'l, ApS v. Henry Holt &
Co._, 873 F.2d 576 (2d Cir. 1989) )); Byrne v. Brit. Broad. Corp. , 132 F. Supp. 2d 229 , 236, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (denying
summary judgment as to non-infringement where material issues of fact remained regarding fair use).

Accordingly, Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to Defendants’ first, third, fifth, sixth, seventh,
eleventh, and thirteenth affirmative defenses, and DENIED as to their second and tenth defenses.

VI. Attorney's Fees and Sanctions

Defendants also move for attorney's fees and sanctions, either as prevailing parties or because ""the acts of Plaintiff and
counsel in bringing this case are so clearly in bad faith that Defendant is entitled to attorney's fees"" under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 11, 28 U.S.C. § 1927, or the Court's inherent powers. Def. Mem. at 23.

As the Court has not resolved the instant motions in Ratajkowski's favor, she is not the prevailing party. However, the Court
could award sanctions to Ratajkowski. Under both the Court's inherent power and 28 U.S.C. § 1927, 2the Court must find by
clear and convincing evidence that ""the attorney's actions are so completely without merit as to require the conclusion that
they must have been undertaken for some improper purpose such as delay."" Baker v. Urb. Ouifitters. Inc. 431 F. Supp. 2d
351 , 362 (S.D.N.Y. 2006), aff'd , 249 F. App'x 845 (2d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). This bad faith can be inferred when ""an
attorney engages in conduct that is so objectively unreasonable that he necessarily must have been acting in bad faith."" /d.

Defendants contend that Plaintiff's bad faith is evident in his failure to investigate whether any actual damages existed and
his claim of actual damages


--- Page 11 ---
[563 F.Supp.3d 138]

that were ""wildly out of proportion"" to what the Photograph could be worth. Def. Mem. at 26. The Court notes that Plaintiff's
counsel's firm has previously been sanctioned for misrepresenting the law or the facts to the court. See, e.g. , Adlife Mktg. &
Commce'ns Co., Inc. v. Buckingham Bros., LLC , No. 19 Civ. 796, 2020 WL 4795287, at *4-10 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 18, 2020) ;
Usherson v. Bandshell Artist Mgmt. , No. 19 Civ. 6368, 2020 WL 3483661 (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2020), affd in part sub nom.
Liebowitz v. Bandshell Artist Mgmt. , 858 Fed.Appx. 457 (2d Cir. 2021). However, the sanctions inquiry is particularized as to
each case, and in this case, there is no evidence that Plaintiff and his counsel have made misrepresentations to the Court or
engaged in unduly vexatious litigation practices. Yang , 2020 WL 6562403, at *4—5. Moreover, although the amount of
statutory damages requested by Plaintiff is undoubtedly extremely high compared to the amount of actual damages he
would be due, actual damages are not the only factor in determining statutory damages. See supra Pt. Ill. Because Plaintiff
is not barred from statutory damages altogether, such a claim does not present clear and convincing evidence of bad faith.
Cf. Baker v. Urb. Outfitters, Inc. , 431 F. Supp. 2d 351 , 363-64 (S.D.N.Y. 2006), aff'd , 249 F. App'x 845 (2d Cir. 2007)
(granting sanctions where plaintiff asserted claims for statutory damages after he knew such recovery was legally barred). If,
however, in the course of arguing for an amount of statutory damages Plaintiff misrepresents the law to the Court, Adlife
Mktg. & Commc'ns Co., Inc. , 2020 WL 4795287, at *7—-8, or otherwise acts unreasonably, then the Court may take action
accordingly.

Defendants also argue that Emrata should be awarded attorney's fees and costs, because Plaintiff and his counsel did not
research whether Emrata had any relationship to the subject matter of the complaint before bringing the action against it.

Def. Opp'n at 23. As the Court dismissed the claims against Emrata, it is a prevailing party. Rock v. Enfants Riches
Deprimes, LLC , No. 17 Civ. 2618, 2020 WL 468904, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2020), reconsideration denied sub nom. Rock
v. Enfants Riches Deprimes, LLC. , No. 17 Civ. 2618, 2020 WL 2793026 (S.D.N.Y. May 29, 2020). Courts possess ""broad
leeway"" to award fees under the Copyright Act when doing so will ""advance[ ] the Copyright Act's goals."" Kirtsaeng v. John

Wiley & Sons, Inc._, 579 U.S. 197 , 136 S. Ct. 1979 , 1985-86, 195 L.Ed.2d 368 (2016) . ""[S]everal nonexclusive factors""
inform this exercise of discretion, including ""frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness, and the need in
particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence."" /d. at 1985 (quotation marks,
alteration, and citation omitted). ""Although objective reasonableness [of the losing party's position] carries significant weight,
courts must view all the circumstances of a case on their own terms."" /d. at 1989.

Plaintiff makes no claims against Emrata in its motion for summary judgment, and there is no evidence of its connection to
the infringement. Supra § II.C. Plaintiff stated he intended to withdraw his claim against it, ECF No. 28 at 1, but has yet to do
so. Plaintiff admittedly has ""no idea"" whether Emrata has anything to do with the subject matter of the complaint. Def. 56.1
Stmt. at 14. Although Plaintiff did not move for summary judgment against Emrata, Pl. Mot., thereby not forcing Emrata to
defend itself, by failing to dismiss Emrata promptly, he forced Emrata to move for summary judgment. As there appears to
be ""no legal or factual support"" underlying the claims against Emrata and Plaintiff was unable

[563 F.Supp.3d 139]

""to substantiate any of its allegations"" against it, the Court concludes that it should be awarded its attorney's fees and costs.
See Viva Video, Inc. v. Cabrera , 9 F. App'x 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2001) ; cf. Mourabit v. Klein, No. 18 Civ. 8313, 2020 WL
5211042, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 2020) (noting that fees were not warranted because plaintiff voluntarily withdrew non-
meritorious claims).

Accordingly, Defendants’ requests for attorney's fees, costs, and sanctions is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated above, both motions for summary judgment are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Specifically,
Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on Ratajkowski's infringement is GRANTED; Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment
dismissing Defendants’ affirmative defenses is GRANTED as to defenses one, three, five, six, seven, eleven, twelve, and
thirteen, and DENIED as to defenses two, four (fair use), and ten. Defendants’ motion is GRANTED to the extent that the
claims against Emrata are DISMISSED, and its motion for attorney's fees and costs is GRANTED. The balance of
Defendants’ motion is DENIED. By October 28, 2021 , Emrata may file contemporaneous billing records and other
documented expenses in support of an award of attorney's fees and costs.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:

1The following facts are drawn from the parties’ pleadings and submissions, including the complaint, the Rule 56.1 statements of undisputed facts, and
the opposing party's responses. Disputed facts are so noted. Citations to a paragraph in the Rule 56.1 statement also includes the opposing party's
response. Because Defendants did not respond to Plaintiff's 56.1 statement, the Court considers those facts admitted. Kiefer v. Crane Co. , No. 12 Civ.
7613, 2014 WL 6778704, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 2014). However, the court may not rely solely on the statement of undisputed facts contained in the
moving party's Rule 56.1 statement; it also must be satisfied that ""each statement of material fact is supported by record evidence sufficient to satisfy the
movant's burden of production[.]"" Jackson v. Fed. Exp. . 766 F.3d 189 , 194 (2d Cir. 2014).



--- Page 12 ---
2 Defendants appear to argue that because the short length of time the Instagram Photograph was visible means the use was de minimis , impacting the
fair use analysis. Def. Opp'n at 12. However, the de minimis doctrine goes to substantial similarity, rather than fair use. Ringgold v. Black Ent. Television,

Inc. , 126 F.3d 70 , 75-76 (2d Cir. 1997). And, insofar as Defendants attempt to raise the de minimis affirmative defense here given the Instagram
Photograph was only displayed for 24 hours, use of an entire photograph for hours is not de minimis. See Hirsch v. Complex Media, Inc. , No. 18 Civ.
5488, 2018 WL 6985227, at “4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 2018) (""A number of courts in this [d]istrict applying Ringgold have concluded that a ‘substantially full-
screen’ display of an image, even those lasting less than three seconds, would not be de minimis. "" (quoting Ringgold_, 126 F.3d at 77 )).

3 Defendants also move for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. Def. Mem. at 23. However, Defendants did not comply with the
procedural requirements of Rule 11, including making such a motion separately, and serving it on Plaintiff 21 days before filing the motion with the Court.
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c). Courts ""regularly"" deny such procedurally deficient motions for sanctions. Ctr. for Discovery, Inc. v. D.P. , No. 16 Civ. 3936,
2017 WL 9674514, at “9 (E.D.N.Y. July 17, 2017) (collecting cases), report and recommendation adopted in relevant part , No. 16 Civ. 3936, 2018 WL

Proceedings (In Chambers): ORDER RE: PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [84];
DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [88]

The Honorable MICHAEL W. FITZGERALD, U.S. District Judge
[401 F.Supp.3d 956]
Before the Court are two motions for summary judgment filed on April 8, 2019:

First, there is Plaintiff Matt Furie's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (the ""Furie Motion""). (Docket No. 84). Defendants
Infowars, LLC (""Infowars"") and Free Speech Systems, LLC (""FSS"") filed an Opposition on April 15, 2019. (Docket No. 95).
Plaintiff filed a Reply on April 22, 2019. (Docket No. 107).

Second, there is Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (the ""Infowars Motion""). (Docket No. 88). Plaintiff filed his
Opposition on April 15, 2019. (Docket No. 92). On April 22, 2019, Defendants filed their Reply. (Docket No. 102).

The Court read and considered the papers submitted on the two motions and held a hearing on May 6, 2019.

For the reasons discussed below, the motions are ruled upon as follows:

* The Furie Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. As to the affirmative defenses of abandonment
and de minimis use, the parties have presented conflicting evidence and summary judgment is therefore
inappropriate. As to the affirmative defenses of lack of copyright, invalid certificate of registration, and implied
license, Defendants fail to rebut the undisputed evidence presented by Plaintiff.

* The Infowars Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part . On summary judgment, Defendants fail to
establish that no rational jury could conclude that Infowars was incorrectly named as a Defendant. And as in most
cases, it is for the jury to determine whether Defendants have proven the defense of fair use. Defendants,
however, have presented undisputed evidence to show that Plaintiff is not entitled to statutory damages and
attorneys' fees.

|. BACKGROUND
On March 5, 2018, Plaintiff commenced this copyright infringement action. ( See generally Complaint (Docket No. 1)).

The following facts are based on the evidence, as viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, either Plaintiff
or Defendants where appropriate. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242 , 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202
(1986) (On a motion for summary judgment, ""[t]he evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences
are to be drawn in his [or her] favor."").

A. The Origin of Pepe the Frog

On November 18, 2003, Plaintiff first published an online comic book called Play Time that features Pepe the Frog as one of
several characters. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (""DSUF"") No. 1 (Docket No. 93);
Defendants’ Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (""PSUF"") No. 1 (Docket No. 95-1)). Pepe the Frog is
not drawn in color in any panel within the comic and is typically depicted with large bulging eyes and multiple white dots in
his pupils. (DSUF No. 1; PSUF No. 2). On some of the front and back covers, Pepe the Frog is drawn in color and is
presented as having green lips and puffy eyelids. (PSUF No. 3).


--- Page 2 ---
[401 F.Supp.3d 957]

Beginning in 2006, Pepe the Frog appeared in a series of comic books called Boy's Club that was published online and in
print. ( /d. No. 4). Like Play Time , Boy's Club featured Pepe the Frog as one of several characters. (DSUF Nos. 2-6).

Between April and July 2007, Plaintiff published in print Boy's Club 1. (PSUF No. 5; DSUF No. 2). Only one drawing of Pepe
the Frog is in color, which shows him with green lips. (DSUF No. 2). He is also shown as having one dot, two dots, or three
dots in each eye in various panels throughout the comic. ( /d. ). He appears in 21 of the comic's 44 pages. ( /d. ).

On June 30, 2008, Plaintiff published in print Boy's Club 2. (PSUF No. 6; DSUF No. 3). Only two drawings of Pepe the Frog
are in color, which shows him with green lips similar to how he was depicted in Boy's Club 1. (DSUF No. 3). He is shown as
having one dot or three dots in each eye in various panels. ( /d. ). He appears in 26 of the comic's 44 pages. ( /d. ).

On August 30, 2009, Plaintiff published in print Boy's Club 3. (PSUF No. 7; DSUF No. 4). Pepe the Frog is not drawn in color
in this comic and is depicted as having only one dot in each eye. (DSUF No. 4). He appears in 17 of the comic's 44 pages. (
Id.).

On September 30, 2010, Plaintiff published in print Boy's Club 4. (PSUF No. 8; DSUF No. 5). Only one drawing of Pepe the
Frog is in color, which shows him with green lips similar to how he was depicted in Boy's Club 1 and Boy's Club 2. (DSUF
No. 5). He is shown as having one dot in all but two panels, where he is shown with one half of a dot in each eye in one
panel and multiple lines through each eye in another. ( /d. ). He appears in 25 of the comic's 44 pages. ( /d. ).

On June 30, 2016, Plaintiff published in print Boy's Club Collective Edition , a compilation of the prior volumes. (PSUF No. 9;
DSUF No. 6). Only two drawings of Pepe the Frog are in color, which show him with green lips. (DSUF No. 6). He is
sometimes shown as having one dot, two dots, three dots, or lines in each eye. ( /d.). He appears in 86 of the comic's 180
pages. ( /d. ).

Below are some depictions of Pepe the Frog in Boy's Club:
(Furie Opp. at 4).

Plaintiff described the character as a ""chill frog dude"" who has a lackadaisical attitude and enjoys spending time with his
animal roommates. (PSUF No. 10). Plaintiff stated, for example, that Pepe the Frog likes ""pop,"" ""pizza,"" and ""talking on his
cell,"" and his signature catch phrase is ""feels good man."" ( /d. Nos. 12-13; DSUF No. 8). Plaintiff described the comics as
""celebrat[ing] the lifestyle of 20-something bros, capturing their lives full of junk food, catchphrases, and bodily fluids with
horrifying and hilarious accuracy."" (PSUF No. 11).

On September 1, 2017, Plaintiff obtained copyright registrations for the various Boy's Club comics. ( Id. Nos. 25-31).
[401 F.Supp.3d 958]
B. The Rise in Popularity of Pepe the Frog

By 2008, Pepe the Frog became a widespread internet meme, appearing throughout social media, online message boards,
and other media sources. ( /d. No. 14). He was commonly depicted with his ""feels good man"" catchphrase. ( /d. No. 15). By
2010, the ""meme phenomenon was kind of peaking for Pepe the Frog."" (DSUF No. 9).

One such meme was created by an anonymous user on August 17, 2009, in an online forum:
(Plaintiffs Response to Defendants’ Additional Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (""DSAUF"") No. 3 (Docket No. 108)).

In an online interview in August 2010, Plaintiff was asked, ""How about the people that actually crop out Pepe's face and use
it, how do you feel about people remixing your work?"" (DSUF No. 18). Plaintiff responded, ""I don't really mind ... | was like it
doesn't look the greatest but | don't care."" ( /d. ). And when asked if he considered himself to be a ""meme creator,"" Plaintiff
answered that he thought that Pepe the Frog ""took a life of its own"" and that ""it's kind of an interesting phenomenon that out
of anything else in the comic took off."" ( /d. ). Once Pepe the Frog became a meme, Plaintiff started to receive examples of
works featuring the character, such as shirts, and did not ""feel any particular happiness or unhappiness about it."" ( Id. No.
11). Rather, Plaintiff ""was just kind of witnessing it as a phenomenon."" ( /d. ).

By 2014, famous celebrities such as Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj began publishing memes featuring Pepe the Frog and users
of online message boards began posting thousands of works featuring Pepe the Frog and calling them ""rare Pepes."" ( /d.
No. 12). In 2015, he was the most reblogged meme on Tumblr. (PSUF No. 16).

Plaintiff stated that Pepe the Frog's popularity as an internet meme eventually turned into a financial windfall for him. (DSUF
No. 24).

The parties dispute the meaning of Plaintiff's statements related to Pepe the Frog that were made in various interviews


--- Page 3 ---
between April 2015 and September 2016. ( /d. Nos. 19-23; PSUF No. 37-40). Plaintiff believes that his statements made in
interviews were sarcastic and a joke or displayed pride for Pepe the Frog, while Defendants believe these public statements
showed abandonment of Plaintiff's copyrights.

On December 20, 2016, Plaintiff created his own visual work called ""Pepe in Blue Shirt,"" for which he obtained a copyright
registration on September 1, 2017. ( See PSUF No. 32; DSUF No. 7). The image is reproduced further below.

C. The Alleged Misappropriation of Pepe the Frog

Plaintiff asserts that, beginning in 2015, white nationalists and members of the ""alt-right"" began associating images of Pepe
the Frog with white supremacist language and symbols, Nazi symbols, and other offensive imagery. (PSUF No. 21; see
DSUF No. 14). Throughout 2015 and 2016, other third parties continued to use Pepe the Frog in images depicting the
character as

[401 F.Supp.3d 959]

or with then-Presidential candidate Donald J. Trump alongside other conservative political figures. ( /d. No. 15; see PSUF
No. 22). Around September 2016, news media began referring to Pepe the Frog as a ""white nationalist symbol."" (DSUF No.
15).

In January 2017, non-party Jon Allen created the first Make America Great Again (""MAGA"") poster. ( Id. No. 42; PSUF No.
43). The MAGA poster is a collage of several politically significant figures during the 2016 presidential election season.
(DSUF No. 43). Pepe the Frog is featured in upper left corner. (PSUF No. 44).

The MAGA poster is reproduced below:
(Furie Mot. at 6).

In creating the MAGA poster, Mr. Allen used an image of Pepe the Frog that he found through a Google image search as his
reference point. (PSUF No. 45; DSUF No. 44). That image was not drawn by Plaintiff. (DSUF No. 44). Mr. Allen was aware

of Pepe the Frog as a meme but was not aware of Plaintiff's existence. ( /d. No. 45). Prior to Pepe the Frog's use in 2016 in

the MAGA posters, Mr. Allen had not seen the character used for political purposes or associated with political figures. ( Id.
No. 57).

Mr. Allen then offered the MAGA poster to FSS to sell on its online stores, located at ""www.infowarsstore.com"" and
""www.infowarsshop.com."" (PSUF No. 47). FSS is the operating business for Infowars. ( /d. No. 48). FSS also promoted the
MAGA posters on The Alex Jones Show and several of FSS's customers commented on Pepe the Frog's inclusion. ( /d.
Nos. 52-53). Gross revenues from sales of the MAGA

[401 F.Supp.3d 960]
poster totaled $31,407.44. ( /d. No. 55; DSUF No. 68).

Plaintiff did not enter into any written license agreement with either Defendants or Mr. Allen for the use of the image or
character of Pepe the Frog. (PSUF No. 56). Plaintiff neither offered an express license to Defendants nor ever contacted, or

attempted to contact, Defendants for a license. ( /d. Nos. 57, 60). Plaintiff also never negotiated with Defendants for the
rights to use the image of Pepe the Frog in the MAGA poster. ( /d. No. 64). Plaintiff has in fact never communicated with
Defendants in any way. ( /d. Nos. 59, 63).

The parties dispute whether the alleged misappropriation of Pepe the Frog by far-right entities and Defendants harmed
Plaintiff's ability to license the character. ( Id. No. 24; DSUF No. 28).

D. Other Relevant Facts

The character El Sapo Pepe is an Argentinian anthropomorphic frog that has existed since at least 1988, and shows
featuring El Sapo Pepe were broadcast in Argentina and other ""Central American"" (presumably Latin American) countries
since at least that time. (DSUF No. 69).

Below is a side-by-side comparison of Pepe the Frog and El Sapo Pepe:

(Furie Mot. at 18).

In the summer of 2004, Plaintiff traveled to Tijuana and San Felipe, Mexico. ( /d. No. 70). Apart from this trip, Plaintiff never
visited any Latin American country prior to creating Pepe the Frog. (PSUF No. 82).

Il. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS

Plaintiff objects to some of the evidence on which Defendants rely. Specifically, Plaintiff points out that Defendants failed to
identify or produce any of what is now included as Exhibits 2-12, 14-15, 17, and 18 to the Furie Opposition. (Furie Reply at


--- Page 4 ---
5). Defendants also failed to produce what is now included as Exhibits 10-13, 15-21, 26-27, 37, and 43 to the Infowars
Motion. (Infowars Opp. at 3-4).

As the Court noted in its Order re: Undisclosed Evidence, it takes seriously the parties' discovery obligations under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 26. (Docket No. 115). Rule 37 provides that where a party fails to offer information as required by
Rules 26(a) and 26(e), the party is not allowed to use that information as evidence on a motion unless the failure was
substantially

[401 F.Supp.3d 961]
justified or harmless. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).

As to the exhibits attached to the Infowars Motion, Defendants contend that ""[e]very single document [Plaintiff] seeks to
exclude is a screenshot from a publicly-accessible web site, and none of them should be excluded."" (Infowars Reply at 4-5).
Defendants finally note that if Plaintiff ""truly believes that he cannot fairly defend against this evidence, [Defendants are
willing to] stipulate[ ] to him taking whatever additional discovery that they may reasonably seek under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d).""
(Id. at 7 n.6). As to the exhibits attached to the Furie Opposition, Defendants explained at the hearing that they are also
predominantly publicly available.

As indicated at the hearing, the Court is mainly concerned with the circumstance where a party has a document in his or its
possession at the beginning of a case, where that document was likely going to be used at trial, and where the party
withheld disclosure of that document. That does not appear to be the case here. In issuing this Order, the Court assumes
that the submitted evidence will be admissible at trial. However, as to the exhibits listed above, Defendants are ORDERED
to submit a report on when each exhibit came into a Defendants’ possession and when the intent was formed to use the
exhibit as evidence. The report shall be filed no later than May 29, 2019.

In ruling on the two motions, the Court relies only upon admissible evidence. To the extent the Court relies upon evidence to
which Plaintiff objects, the objections are OVERRULED . To the extent the Court does not, the objections are DENIED as
moot.

Ill. LEGAL STANDARD

In deciding a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, the Court applies Anderson , Celotex , and their Ninth Circuit
progeny. Anderson__477 U.S. 242 , 106 S.Ct. 2505 ; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett 477 U.S. 317 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d
265 (1986) . ""The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any
material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

The Ninth Circuit has defined the shifting burden of proof governing motions for summary judgment where the non-moving
party bears the burden of proof at trial:

The moving party initially bears the burden of proving the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Where the
non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only prove that there is an absence of
evidence to support the non-moving party's case. Where the moving party meets that burden, the burden then
shifts to the non-moving party to designate specific facts demonstrating the existence of genuine issues for trial.
This burden is not a light one. The non-moving party must show more than the mere existence of a scintilla of
evidence. The non-moving party must do more than show there is some ""metaphysical doubt"" as to the material
facts at issue. In fact, the non-moving party must come forth with evidence from which a jury could reasonably
render a verdict in the non-moving party's favor.

Coomes v. Edmonds Sch. Dist. No. 15_. 816 F.3d 1255 , 1259 n.2 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting /n re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig. . 627
F.3d 376 , 387 (9th Cir. 2010) ). ""A motion for summary judgment may not be defeated, however, by evidence that is ‘merely
colorable’ or ‘is not significantly probative.’ "" Anderson__477 U.S. at 249 -50, 106 S.Ct. 2505 .

""When the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of
[401 F.Supp.3d 962]

proof at trial, ‘it must come forward with evidence which would entitle it to a directed verdict if the evidence went
uncontroverted at trial.’"""".C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co. v. Darden Restaurants, Inc. , 213 F.3d 474 , 480 (9th Cir. 2000)
(quoting Houghton v. South , 965 F.2d 1532 , 1536 (9th Cir. 1992) ).

IV. THE FURIE MOTION

Plaintiff argues that there are no genuine disputes of material fact to preclude summary judgment on Defendants’ affirmative
defenses for lack of copyright, invalid certificate of registration, abandonment or forfeiture, implied or explicit license, and de
minimis use. (Furie Mot. at 8-23).

A. Lack of Copyright

In their first affirmative defense, Defendants assert that Plaintiff does not have a valid copyright in Pepe the Frog because


--- Page 5 ---
the character was allegedly copied from El Sapo Pepe. (Affirmative Defenses to Amended Answers {| 1—4 (Docket Nos.
69-70)).

""[I]n order to establish that the plaintiff copied a preexisting work, a defendant must show that plaintiff had access to the
prior work and that plaintiff's work is substantially similar to the prior work in both ideas and expression."" N. Coast Indus. v.
Jason Maxwell, Inc. 972 F.2d 1031 , 1033 (9th Cir. 1992) (concluding that there is no question had access to the
copyrighted work and that the ""issue of whether the manufacturer's geometric arrangement of color box, which was similar
to but not identical to French design inspired by Mondrian, was copyrightable was for jury"").

Here, Plaintiff argues that, during his deposition, he has ""unequivocally denie[d] that El Sapo [Pepe] was an inspiration for
Pepe the Frog in any way"" and that ""he had never heard of or seen El Sapo [Pepe] before this lawsuit."" (Furie Mot. at 17).
Plaintiff also argues that he could not ""have been aware of an Argentine cartoon character when the uncontroverted
evidence shows he never traveled to Argentina (or any Latin American country) prior to creating Pepe the Frog."" ( /d. at 17—
18). Plaintiff therefore has met his initial burden to show his lack of access to El Sapo Pepe. At the hearing, Plaintiff also
reiterated these facts and added that Defendants have not provided any evidence that El Sapo Pepe even left Argentina and
became famous in other countries.

In response, Defendants argues that the ""timeline of Pepe the Frog's development casts doubt on [his] claim of originality.""
(Furie Opp. at 9). Defendants explain that Pepe the Frog ""was a mostly formless blob in 2003"" and then ""took on
significantly more frog-like features and a frog-like green skin tone"" in 2006. ( /d. ). Defendants suggest that ""[t]he only
explanation for the change is [Plaintiff's] visit to Mexico, where Pepe the Toad was popular and [Plaintiff] was likely to have
seen the character."" ( /d. ). Defendants contend that the creation of Pepe the Frog when El Sapo Pepe ""was ubiquitous in
Latin America is suspect"" and cannot be ""just a big coincidence."" ( /d. at 9). Defendants finally argue that Plaintiff's claim that
he ""had never heard of Pepe the Toad prior to this lawsuit"" is ""self-serving testimony"" and that Plaintiff ""perjured himself
when he denied copying popular characters into his own artwork."" ( /d. at 8).

At the hearing, Defendants also pointed to numerous other drawings by Plaintiff ( e.g. , Big Bird from Sesame Street, Freddy
Krueger, and Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy) to argue that he was interested in cartoon characters and could have
seen El Sapo Pepe. Defendants further added that Plaintiff's visit to Mexico was likely irrelevant

[401 F.Supp.3d 963]
so long as he had access to the Internet.

Defendants have pointed to no direct evidence to show that Plaintiff had access to El Sapo Pepe, apart from the fact that he
traveled to Tijuana and San Felipe in the summer of 2004, if that can be called evidence of access. Defendants did not
submit evidence that shows featuring El Sapo Pepe were broadcast in Mexico in 2004. Nor do Defendants offer any
evidence to rebut Plaintiff's testimony that he was unaware of El Sapo Pepe prior to this action.

To the extent Defendants argue all that is required is that Plaintiff had access to the Internet, this argument is even more
unsubstantiated than the one relating to Plaintiff's visit to Mexico in 2004. Indeed, Nimmer's analysis is as follows:

Regardless of previous definitions of the concept of ""access,"" ... [a court should] return[ ] to first principles in
ruling that the existence of the plaintiff's copyrighted materials on the Internet, even on a public and user-friendly
site, cannot by itself justify an inference that the defendant accessed those materials.

4 Nimmer on Copyright § 13.02[D] (2019) (quotation marks and citation omitted).

Defendants’ arguments are speculative at best. Summary judgment is therefore appropriate. See, e.g. , Media.net Advert.
FZ-LLC v. NetSeer, Inc. , 156 F. Supp. 3d 1052, 1068 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (concluding that the plaintiff ""makes conclusory
assertions that [the defendant] copied the HTML code from [its] search results pages and does not explain how [the
defendant] had access to it""). Having concluded that there is no genuine dispute of material facts as to lack of access, the
Court need not reach substantial similarity.

Accordingly, the Furie Motion is GRANTED as to the affirmative defense of lack of copyright.

B. Invalid Certificate of Registration

In their seventh affirmative defense, Defendants assert that Plaintiff does not have a valid certificate of registration over
Pepe in Blue Shirt because he provided inaccurate information to the Copyright Office when applying for copyright
registration. (Affirmative Defenses to Amended Answers {§ 42-43).

Under the Copyright Act, a certificate of registration satisfies statutory requirements and is valid unless (1) the applicant
knowingly included inaccurate information and (2) the inaccuracy would have caused the Copyright Office to refuse
registration. 17 U.S.C. § 411(b)(1). Speculation about potential errors in a copyright application or unoriginality of the
copyrighted work does not suffice to establish invalidity. Indeed, ""[s]imply stated, a misstatement or clerical error in the
registration application, if unaccompanied by fraud, should neither invalidate the copyright nor render the registration
certificate incapable of supporting an infringement action."" 3 Nimmer on Copyright § 7.20[B][1] (2019).


--- Page 6 ---
s0

Defendants argue that Plaintiff ""lied to the Copyright Office by representing that he owned all material in ‘Pepe in Blue Shirt’,
when it was in fact a derivative work. (Furie Opp. at 9). Defendants explain that Pepe in Blue Shirt is a ""literal copy"" of the
2009 ""not good man"" image that was created over six years by an anonymous user on www.bodybuilding.com. ( /d. at 8).
Defendants contend that because protection in derivative works extends ""only to new material added by the author,"" the
Copyright Office ""would have rejected [his] application"" for Pepe in Blue Shirt if Plaintiff had disclosed the ""not good man""
image. ( /d. at 11). At the hearing, Defendants repeated these arguments.

Plaintiff disagrees and argues that he ""himself drew and published a black-and-white version of [the ‘not good man’ image]
[401 F.Supp.3d 964]

in 2006, in Boy's Club 1."" (Furie Reply at 13). Plaintiff offers the following comparison:

(Id. ).

According to Plaintiff, the "" bodybuilding.com image was a copy of [his] own Boys Club 1 image—just filled in with color, and
with the addition of the ‘not good man’ caption."" ( /d. ). The expression, eyes, puffy lips, disappointed face, and other
features are otherwise identical. ( /d. ).

Here, the basis of Defendants’ invalid registration argument is that Plaintiff failed to disclose the ""not good man"" image as
source material, even though Plaintiff had originally created and disclosed the black-and-white comic image. But in general,
the ""failure to disclose that the registered work is derivative of an earlier, underlying work should occasion rejection of the
registration certificate only if the claimant was for some reason ineligible to register the derivative work. It is therefore
unsustainable to allege that a certificate is invalid because it fails to disclose to the Copyright Office minor items
containing pre-existing details ."" 2 Nimmer on Copyright § 7.20[B][1] (emphasis added).

To overcome the presumption of validity, Defendants must produce evidence both that Plaintiff intended to provide the
Copyright Office with inaccurate information in his copyright application and that the Copyright Office would not have issued
the registration for Pepe in Blue Shirt had it received accurate information. Defendants have simply presented evidence of
neither. Notwithstanding the fact that it is Plaintiff's burden to establish Defendants’ liability for copyright infringement,
Defendants may not avoid liability merely by suggesting that Plaintiff may have intended to defraud the Copyright Office.
That would ""defeat[ ] the goals of summary judgment by according defendants a seemingly automatic defense based on
fraud, even absent any showing on the subject."" /d.

Accordingly, the Furie Motion is GRANTED as to the affirmative defense of invalid copyright registration.

C. Abandonment or Forfeiture

In their third affirmative defense, Defendants assert that Plaintiff's public interview
401 F.Supp.3d 965]

statements indicate that he abandoned or forfeited some or all of his copyrights in Pepe the Frog. (Affirmative Defenses to
Amended Answers {§ 31-36). It appears that Defendants are not maintaining the affirmative defense of forfeiture because
hey neither addressed it in opposing summary judgment nor at the hearing. The Court therefore will address only the
affirmative defense of abandonment.

In copyright, abandonment is ""the intentional relinquishment of a known right with knowledge of its existence and the intent
0 relinquish it."" A & M Records. Inc. v. Napster, Inc. , 239 F.3d 1004 , 1026 (9th Cir. 2001) (discussing waiver and
abandonment and concluding that the district court correctly ""rejected [the] valid affirmative defense[ ] of waiver""). But
abandonment of copyright ""occurs only if there is an intent by the copyright proprietor to surrender rights in his work."" /d.
(citing 4 Nimmer on Copyright § 13.06.

Here, the parties dispute whether Plaintiff's public statements are sufficient evidence to indicate that he abandoned his
copyright in Pepe the Frog. Defendants argue that, between 2010 and 2016, Plaintiff made numerous statements to various
media outlets that ""he was happy about Pepe the Frog becoming a meme, that he was not bothered (and was in fact
inspired) by rampant unauthorized use of the character, that he was aware of third parties making a profit off these
unauthorized works but did nothing to stop them, and that he had lost control over the character."" (Furie Opp. at 17).

As one example, on April 12, 2015, Plaintiff gave an interview to The Daily Dot , where he was asked what he thought about
""people profiting off of Pepe [the Frog]."" (Plaintiff's Objections and Responses to Defendants' First Set of Requests for
Admission No. 4 (Docket No. 88-18)). In response, Plaintiff provided the following answer:

| believe in supporting people's decisions to profit off of Pepe in order to provide them with the most positive
business experience possible. | strive to be an advocate for Pepe in both love and enterprise and hope to help
business people to have an empowering and joyful experience while making an ocean of profits as limitless as
the universe.

(Id. ). According to Plaintiff, this statement was made ""sarcastically."" ( /d. ).


--- Page 7 ---
In another interview with New York Magazine in September 2016, Plaintiff stated that he ""realized that Pepe is beyond my
control ... He's like a kid, he grew up and now | have to set him free to live his life."" ( /d. No. 3). Plaintiff also stated, ""I just sit
back, relax and let the Pepes fall where they land, my friend!"" ( /d. ).

In yet another interview with The Atlantic on September 13, 2016, Plaintiff provided the following answers:
Q: How do you feel about the way it's been adopted by the so-called alt-right?

A: My feelings are pretty neutral, this isn't the first time that Pepe has been used in a negative, weird context. |
think it's just a reflection of the world at large. The internet is basically encompassing some kind of mass
consciousness, and Pepe, with his face, he's got these large, expressive eyes with puffy eyelids and big rounded
lips, | just think that people reinvent him in all these different ways, it's kind of a blank slate. It's just out of my
control, what people are doing with it, and my thoughts on it, are more of amusement...

Q: Do you have any regrets about Pepe or not having more control over his image?
[401 F.Supp.3d 966]

A: | don't have any regrets about anything. | do my own thing, and if anything, it's been kind of interesting to see
all the evolutions of Pepe. Yeah, no regrets.

(Furie Opp., Ex. 75 (Docket No. 96-6)).

Defendants argue that, after these public interviews and statements were made, Plaintiff ""attempted to counter this
negativity with positive depictions of Pepe the Frog and eventually ‘killed’ the character."" ( /d. at 18). Defendants specifically
point to Plaintiff's deposition testimony, as follows:

Q: So you said you killed Pepe?
A: Yes.

Q: Is that accurate to say that?
A: Yes.

Q: In 2016?

A: Yes.... I'm not sure what the time frame was. But there were associations with that character, Pepe, that were
frustrating me.

Q: Tell me about those.

A: The attention in the public perception at that time became complicated. You know, the associations of Pepe
got interwoven with some kind of Neo-Nazi or Alt Right agenda. He had become, in the eyes of some, a mascot
for hate groups.

(Infowars Mot, Ex. 9 at 60:12-61:3 (Docket No. 88-13)).

Defendants argue that Plaintiffs ""numerous public statements encouraging third-party use of Pepe the Frog ... cumulatively
tell the world that he consents to the copying, modifying, and distributing of Pepe the Frog, even with commercial use of the
character."" (Furie Opp. at 20).

Plaintiff disagrees and contends that he ""made clear public statements confirming that he owned and would enforce his
copyrights in Pepe."" (Furie Reply at 9). Examples of public statements include the following: (1) Plaintiff's statement that
""Pepe the Frog is copyrighted by me"" in an esquire.com article published on September 28, 2016; (2) reports by
Motherboard that Plaintiff ""will aggressively enforce his intellectual property, using legal action if necessary, to end the
misappropriation of Pepe the Frog,"" published on August 28, 2017; and (3) Plaintiff's issued press release indicating that he
has ""expanded enforcement efforts to end the misappropriation of Pepe by taking legal action against additional infringers,""
published on September 18, 2017. (Furie Mot. at 13-14).

Contrary to Plaintiffs contention that there is no evidence of ""clear, decisive conduct required to establish that [Plaintiff]
intended to surrender his rights in Pepe,” the Court concludes that there is a genuine dispute of material facts to preclude
summary judgment on the affirmative defense of abandonment. ( See id. at 15). As both parties recognize, whether Plaintiff
abandoned his copyright turns on his intent as evidenced by how his public statements should be interpreted. But on a
motion for summary judgment, the Court can neither determine Plaintiff's credibility nor place weight on his competing public
statements. See, e.g. , Conn v. City of Reno, 591 F.3d 1081 , 1098 (9th Cir. 2010) (concluding that ""questions involving a
person's state of mind are generally factual issues inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment"" and that the court
""may not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence""), vacated. 563 U.S. 915 , 131 S.Ct. 1812 , 179



--- Page 8 ---
L.Ed.2d 769 (2011) , opinion reinstated in relevant part. 658 F.3d 897 (9th Cir. 2011) ; Banks v. Hayward . 216 F.3d 1082 ,
1082 (9th Cir. 2000) (""Moreover, in evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court may not make credibility
determinations or weigh conflicting evidence."").

Both parties have simply presented conflicting public statements made by Plaintiff relating to his intent over his copyright.
[401 F.Supp.3d 967]

Defendants point to public statements that suggest—or at least can be reasonably viewed as suggesting—Pepe the Frog
was out of Plaintiff's control and was ""killed"" as a character. Plaintiff points to other public statements where he reaffirmed
his ownership over Pepe the Frog, suggesting no intent to abandon the character. The dispute is therefore more
appropriately left to the jury rather than determined by the Court on summary judgment. See Gray v. Virga, No. 12-CV-
3006-KJM, 2017 WL 117895, at “9 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 12, 2017) (""The disputes caused by the competing declarations cannot be
resolved without credibility determinations, which are the function of the jury, not of a judge on a motion for summary
judgment."").

The Court views as particularly persuasive Marya v. Warner/Chappell Music, Inc. , 131 F. Supp. 3d 975 (C.D. Cal. 2015), a
case relied upon by both parties. There, the district court considered a copyright infringement claim involving the song
Happy Birthday to You and another song with the same melody called Good Morning to All. Id. at 979. In analyzing whether
certain overt acts constituted abandonment, the district court looked at the statements made in the following T/ME magazine
article:

Because the tune of ""Happy Birthday to You"" sounds precisely like the tune of ""Good Morning to All,"" Sam H.
Harris, producer of As Thousands Cheer, last week found himself the defendant in a Federal plagiarism suit
asking payment of $250 for each and every performance of the song.... Lyricist Patty Hill, who will share in the
damages, if any, had no complaint to make on the use of the words because she long ago resigned herself to the
fact that her ditty had become common property of the nation.

Id. at 992 (emphasis removed).

The district court noted that the ""clear implication from the article is that [the author] told the T/ME journalist that she had
surrendered any claim she may have had to the Happy Birthday lyrics."" Id. at 993. The district court also noted that the
public statement in the TIME magazine article, ""if believed, is an overt act on which a reasonable fact finder could base a
finding that [the author] abandoned her copyright interest in the lyrics."" /d. But importantly, the district court ""cannot say that
this evidence is sufficient to entitle [the plaintiffs] to a directed verdict at trial inasmuch as it is not a direct quote from [the
author],"" because the journalist ""could have been paraphrasing something she said or relying on a secondary source to
characterize her intentions."" /d. The district court thus denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their affirmative
defense of abandonment because, like here, ""this article is at least sufficient to raise triable issues of fact as to whether [the
author] abandoned her rights."" /d.

Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendants as the non-moving parties, it is evident that a genuine issue of
material fact remains in dispute. Whether Plaintiff's statements are ""sarcastic"" is something for the jury to decide.

At the hearing, Plaintiff also pointed out that Defendants have cited only one case, Melchizedek v. Holt , 792 F. Supp. 2d
1042 (D. Ariz. 2011) , in which abandonment survived summary judgment. Plaintiff then pointed out that the statements
made in Melchizedek —""| don't care about copyrights or any of that stuff, that doesn't matter""; ""But at the same time,
personally | have never cared about the copyrights""; and ""Some people believe that | am protecting my copyrights and don't
understand that there are more important issues than copyrights""—directly related to copyright ownership. See id. at 1047—
48, 1053. Plaintiff argued that, in contrast to the plaintiffs remarks in Melchizedek , his

[401 F.Supp.3d 968]
statements in the public interviews were not related to copyright ownership.

The Court disagrees with Plaintiff. The district court in Melchizedek recognized that the ""remark quoted above [relating to
copyrights] does not specify which copyrighted work or works that Plaintiff is discussing with his audience."" /d. at 1053. The
jury therefore could ""reasonably interpret Plaintiff's remarks to constitute an overt act indicative of his intent to abandon his
copyright protection"" or ""insufficient to constitute overt acts or do not even refer to the Copyrighted Work"" at issue. /d. But
based upon these ambiguous remarks, like here, ""it is a disputed question of fact as to whether Plaintiff's intent was to
abandon his copyright protection in these works."" /d. at 1053-54. Indeed, it is particularly appropriate for the jury to
determine Plaintiff's intent, whether he was ""sarcastic"" in making some of these public remarks, what he meant when he
said that he ""killed"" Pepe the Frog, and numerous other factual disputes.

Accordingly, the Furie Motion is DENIED as to the affirmative defense of abandonment.

D. Implied or Explicit License

In their fourth affirmative defense, Defendants assert that Plaintiff gave the general public an ""implied or explicit license"" to


--- Page 9 ---
use Pepe the Frog. (Affirmative Defenses to Amended Answers {§ 37-39). It is undisputed that there is no explicit license.

The existence of an implied license is an affirmative defense to a claim of copyright infringement and the burden of proof is
ultimately on the party seeking to avoid infringement liability. Worldwide Church of God v. Philadelphia Church of God, Inc.
227 F.3d 1110 , 1114 (9th Cir. 2000) (concluding that the ""existence of a license creates an affirmative defense to a claim of
copyright infringement""). ""[A] nonexclusive license may be granted orally, or may even be implied from conduct."" Effects
Assocs., Inc. v. Cohen , 908 F.2d 555 , 556-58 (9th Cir. 1990) (quoting 3 Nimmer § 10.03[A] (1989)).

""[T]he Ninth Circuit [has] confirmed that whether an implied license exists is a matter of contract law; as such, it is governed
by state law ...."" Interscope Records v. Time Warner, Inc. , No. 10-CV-1772-SVW (PJWx), 2010 WL 11505708, at *5 (C.D.
Cal. June 28, 2010) (citing Foad Consulting Grp., Inc. v. Azzalino , 270 F.3d 821 , 827 (9th Cir. 2001) ). The party asserting
the affirmative defense of an implied license therefore must prove ""the same elements necessary to evidence an express
contract: mutual assent or offer and acceptance, consideration, legal capacity and lawful subject matter."" Northstar Fin.
Advisors Inc. v. Schwab Invs. , 779 F.3d 1036 , 1050-51 (9th Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).

Here, Plaintiff argues that there was no implied license because ""there was no evidence of offer and acceptance or
consideration between the parties,"" basic missing contractual elements. (Furie Mot. at 10). As indicated above, Plaintiff has
never actually communicated to Defendants. In opposition, Defendants point to numerous public statements made by
Plaintiff, as previously discussed. (Furie Opp. at 17-20).

The Court disagrees with Defendants. Those public statements cannot constitute an offer made by Plaintiff because they did
not ""invite the performance of a specific act without further communication and leave nothing for negotiation."" See Donovan
v. RRL Corp. , 26 Cal. 4th 261 , 272, 109 Cal. Rptr. 2d 807 , 27 P.3d 702 (2001) (concluding that while there is a reasonable
expectation on the part of consumers that an automobile dealer intends an advertised price to constitute an offer, the offer
can only be accepted by actually paying it); see also 3 Nimmer on Copyright § 10.03[A][7]

[401 F.Supp.3d 969]

(2019) (""[A]n implied license requires more than a general intent of the author regarding disposition of his work.... [T]he
terms—including identity of the licensee—should be reasonably clear.""). Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff's public statements
can be viewed as an offer, Defendants do not explain why there is consideration for an implied license.

At the hearing, Defendants pointed out the fact that Creative Commons licenses exist and appeared to suggest that Plaintiff
elected to employ such a license for Pepe the Frog. But as pointed out by Plaintiff, a Creative Commons license, typically
denoted by a CC within a circle logo, is a specific contractual arrangement in which an artist deliberately gives up certain
rights in his or her work. Here, there is no indication that Plaintiff entered into a Creative Commons license. Nor does Pepe
the Frog contain a Creative Commons designation as far as the Court can discern.

Accordingly, the Furie Motion is GRANTED as to the affirmative defense of implied license.
E. De Minimis Use

In their eighth affirmative defense, Defendants assert that their use of Pepe the Frog was de minimis. (Affirmative Defenses
to Amended Answers { 44).

A ""use is de minimis only if the average audience would not recognize the appropriation."" See VMG Salsoul, LLC v. Ciccone
824 F.3d 871 , 878 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing Newton v. Diamond , 388 F.3d 1189 , 1193 (9th Cir. 2004) ).

Similar to the affirmative defense of abandonment, the parties presented conflicting facts as to whether the use of Pepe the
Frog in the MAGA poster is de minimis. Plaintiff argues that the MAGA posters ""contain enough of Pepe the Frog for the
average audience to recognize the appropriation,"" since the posters depict Pepe the Frog's entire face, bulging eyes,
eyelids, and lips. (Furie Mot. at 23). Plaintiff also points out that Mr. Allen ""intentionally made Pepe recognizable"" and
multiple customers in fact ""recognized Pepe in the MAGA [pJosters."" ( /d. ). At the hearing, Plaintiff repeated these
arguments.

Defendants, however, contend that there is a lack of similarity between Pepe the Frog and the MAGA poster. (Furie Opp. at
12). Defendants point out that, among other things, physical characteristics like being green, having bulging eyes, and a
human-shaped body are not unique characteristics to Pepe the Frog and are common to cartoon frogs in general. ( /d. at
13). Moreover, the MAGA poster does not feature Pepe the Frog's entire torso. ( /d. at 12).

Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendants as the non-moving parties, it is clear that a genuine issue of
material fact remains in dispute. This affirmative defense is therefore more appropriately left to the jury to decide at trial
rather than determined by the Court on summary judgment.

Accordingly, the Furie Motion is DENIED as to the affirmative defense of de minimis use.

V. THE INFOWARS MOTION

As an initial matter, Plaintiff argues that the Infowars Motion should be denied in part for failure to comply with Local Rule 7-


--- Page 10 ---
3. (Infowars Opp. at 2). Plaintiff explains that in the initial email, Defendants represented that they ""would bring a motion for
summary judgment addressing solely the issues of fair use and lack of copyright because of alleged copying of the

Argentinian character ‘El Sapo Pepe’."" ( /d. (emphasis in original)). But Defendants now brought three additional issues
relating to Infowars' status as Defendant, abandonment or implied license, and statutory damages and attorneys' fees. ( /d. ).

[401 F.Supp.3d 970]

In opposition, Defendants contend that during a telephonic conference on March 15, 2019, they indicated that they ""would
also move for summary judgment on the issues of abandonment, implied license, and possibly statutory damages and
attorneys’ fees."" (Infowars Reply at 3-4; Declaration of Marc J. Randazza (""Randazza Decl."") {6-9 (Docket No. 102-2)).
Defendants, however, acknowledge that their basis for seeking summary judgment as to Infowars' status as a Defendant
was not raised during the telephonic conference. (Infowars Reply at 4).

Although it appears that the parties failed to meet and confer in strict compliance with Local Rule 7-3, it does not appear that
Plaintiff has suffered prejudice as a result of this failure. The Court, therefore, will proceed to the merits of the Infowars
Motion. See, e.g. , Reed v. Sandstone Props., L.P. , No. 12-CV-5021-MMM (VBKx), 2013 WL 1344912, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Apr.
2, 2013) (""Because Reed suffered no real prejudice as a result of the late conference, however, the court elects to consider
the motion on the merits.""). Both parties' counsel, however, are warned to scrupulously comply with all Local Rules in the
future.

Turning to the merits of the Infowars Motion, Defendants argue that (1) Infowars did not engage in any alleged misconduct;
(2) the MAGA poster's use of Pepe the Frog was fair use; (3) Plaintiff abandoned his copyright in Pepe the Frog and/or
granted an implied license to the general public; and (4) Plaintiff cannot seek statutory damages and attorneys' fees.
(Infowars Mot. at 9-24).

A. Infowars as a Defendant

Defendants argue that there is no evidence to suggest that Infowars ""engaged in any conduct alleged."" (Infowars Mot. at 9).
Infowars ""is an intellectual property holding company that does no business of any kind and does not operate any web
sites."" ( /d.). Rather, FSS operates the business at www.infowars.com and other related websites, purchased copies of the
MAGA posters from Mr. Allen, and the purchase orders and checks sent to Mr. Allen came from FSS. ( /d. ).

The Court disagrees that there is no evidence to suggest that Infowars was incorrectly named as a Defendant. Alex Jones,
the manager of Infowars, publicly displayed and advertised the MAGA posters for sale. (Infowars Opp. at 4). The websites
on which the MAGA posters were advertised—www.infowars.com and www.prisonplanet.com—listed Infowars as the owner

and operator. ( /d.). Defendants point out that ""these are mistakes, as the sites are operated by FSS and Infowars has no
involvement in the operation of the sites."" (Infowars Mot. at 9). At best, this assertion creates a dispute of fact. See Larin
Corp. v. Alltrade, Inc. , No. 06-EDCV-1394-ODW (OPx), 2008 WL 11338579, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2008) (denying

summary judgment where the plaintiff ""has named both Alltrade, Inc. and Alltrade Tools LLC as defendants because it is
difficult to discern which party is in fact the proper defendant responsible for the alleged wrongdoing"" and finding that
Alltrade, Inc. has not ""present[ed] definitive evidence to show that it is not so intertwined with Alltrade Tools LLC"").
Accordingly, the Infowars Motion is DENIED to the extent it seeks dismissal of Infowars as a Defendant.

B. Fair Use

The doctrine of fair use is a common law doctrine of judicial creation that has been codified as follows:

[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any
other means specified by that section, for purposes

[401 F.Supp.3d 971]
such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship,
or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular
case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
17 U.S.C. § 107.

When Congress incorporated the doctrine of fair use into the Copyright Act, it intended to restate the judicial doctrine but


--- Page 11 ---
""not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way."" H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 66 (1976) (hereinafter ""House Report""); S. Rep.
No. 94-473, at 62 (1975) (hereinafter ""Senate Report""). Supreme Court precedent and the legislative history also make
clear that fair use analysis is not appropriately conducted through the use of bright line rules, but must be dealt with ona
case by case basis. Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enter. , 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588
(1985) (holding that publication of verbatim quotes from the ""heart"" of unpublished memoirs, which was intended to supplant
copyright holders commercially valuable right of first publication, was not fair use); Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City
Studios, Inc. 464 U.S. 417 , 448 & n. 31,104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (holding that sale of home video recording
equipment was not contributory infringement where there were substantial non-infringing uses of the equipment); House
Report at 65-66; Senate Report at 62.

Further, the four statutory factors should not be treated in isolation. ""All [the factors] are to be explored, and the results
weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569 , 578, 114 S.Ct.
1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (holding that commercial character of song parody did not create presumption against fair
use). The four statutory factors must be balanced ""in light of the objectives of copyright law, rather than view[ed] as definitive
or determinative tests."" Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp. , 336 F.3d 811 , 818 (9th Cir. 2003).

""Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact."" Harper & Row Publishers, 471 U.S. at 560 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; see Fisher v.
Dees , 794 F.2d 432 , 436 (9th Cir. 1986) (concluding that only where ""[nJo material historical facts are at issue in th[e]
case,"" a court may rule on fair use ""without usurping the function of the jury""); Oracle Am.. Inc. v. Google LLC , 886 F.3d
1179 , 1195 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (concluding that where ""there are no disputed material historical facts, fair use can be decided
by the court alone"" and that ""disputed historical facts represent questions for the jury"") (citing Fisher).

As an initial matter, Defendants appeared to suggest at the hearing that crafting a jury instruction on fair use to adequately
explain the affirmative defense would be difficult if not impossible. The Court disagrees and notes that the Ninth Circuit
model jury instruction on fair use reads as follows:

One who is not the owner of the copyright may use the copyrighted work in a reasonable way under the
circumstances without the consent of the copyright owner if it would advance the public

[401 F.Supp.3d 972]

interest. Such use of a copyrighted work is called a fair use. The owner of a copyright cannot prevent others from
making a fair use of the owner's copyrighted work.

Defendant contends that defendant made fair use of the copyrighted work for the purpose of [criticism]
[comment] [news reporting] [teaching] [scholarship] [research] other purpose alleged |. The defendant has the
burden of proving this defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

In determining whether the use made of the work was fair, you should consider the following factors:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work; and

[ (5) ] Linsert any other factor that bears on the issue of fair use].

If you find that the defendant has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant made a fair use
of the plaintiffs work, your verdict should be for the defendant.

Ninth Circuit Model Jury Instruction 17.22 (emphasis in original).

The model jury instruction also provides a relatively detailed discussion of each of the four main factors and additional
factor(s) that may be relevant.

1. Purpose and character of use

The ""central purpose"" of the first factor is to determine ""to what extent the new work is transformative."" Campbell__510 U.S.
at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (noting that the inquiry is ""whether the new work merely supersede[s] the objects of the original
creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character""). The Ninth Circuit has adopted a
two-step analysis of this first prong. First, courts ask whether the use of the work is commercial in nature. Second, they ask
whether such use is transformative. Kelly, 336 F.3d at 818 —-19. ""A use is considered transformative only where a defendant
changes a plaintiff's copyrighted work or uses the plaintiff's copyrighted work in a different context such that the plaintiff's
work is transformed into a new creation."" Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.__508 F.3d 1146 , 1164 (9th Cir. 2007)



--- Page 12 ---
(quoting_Waill Data Inc. v. L.A. County Sheriff's Dep't 447 F.3d 769 , 778 (9th Cir. 2006). ""The more transformative the new
work, the less important the other factors, including commercialism, become."" Kelly, 336 F.3d at 818 .

Here, there is no doubt that Defendants’ use of Pepe the Frog in the MAGA posters is commercial in nature. The Ninth
Circuit has explained that commercial use provides only slight weight against finding fair use where the use is not ""highly
exploitative"" and intended to ""save the expense of purchasing authorized copies."" Kelly. 336 F.3d at 818 (use of low-
resolution copies in a commercial search engine was incidental and less exploitative in nature than more traditional types of
commercial use); A & M Records_, 239 F.3d at 1015 (""[C]lommercial use is demonstrated by a showing that repeated and
exploitative unauthorized copies of copyrighted works were made to save the expense of purchasing authorized copies."").

Defendants then argue that the depiction of Pepe the Frog in the MAGA poster is transformative in two aspects, physically
and contextually. (Infowars Mot. at 11).

As to physical differences, Defendants note that Mr. Allen used an image of Pepe the Frog drawn by a third party, rather

[401 F.Supp.3d 973]

than one drawn by Plaintiff. ( /d. ). Mr. Allen also made ""alterations to the shading, the shape of the mouth, the pupils, and
the texture to make it look more naturalistic."" ( /d. (internal quotation marks omitted); Infowars Reply at 10). Moreover, Mr.
Allen only used Pepe the Frog's face, ""not the entire body."" (Infowars Mot. at 11).

In opposition, Plaintiff argues that minor physical alterations are insufficient to be transformative because the image of Pepe
the Frog in the MAGA poster was ""instantly recognizable"" and was in fact recognized by Defendants' employees and
customers. (Infowars. Opp. at 10). Plaintiff provides the following side-by-side comparison:

(id. at 11).

As to contextual differences, Defendants argue that ""Pepe the Frog is only one of 12 faces in the MAGA [ploster, and is one
of the least prominent figures in it, taking up only a small percentage of the total poster."" (Infowars Mot. at 13). Defendants
note that Pepe the Frog is depicted as one of many ""political figures and alternative media members,"" far removed from his

original context in the comics. ( /d. ; Infowars Reply at 11). At the hearing, Defendants reaffirmed the highly transformative
nature of Pepe the Frog because their use was complementary to Plaintiff's use of the original character.

In opposition, Plaintiff correctly notes that in order to be transformative, ""the use of some elements of a prior author's
composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's works ."" (Infowars Opp. at 11 (citing

Monge v. Maya Magazines, Inc. , 688 F.3d 1164 , 1175 (9th Cir. 2012) ) (emphasis added)). Plaintiff then argues that Pepe
the Frog's depiction as a commentary on politics undercuts Defendants' own argument that there is contextual

transformation. ( /d. at 11-12). In other words, the MAGA posters are not commentaries on Pepe the Frog himself. ( /d. at
11).

In response, Defendants argue that Mr. Allen included Pepe the Frog in the MAGA poster to, among other things,
""symbolize the sharing of memes during the 2016 presidential election"" and ""express the ridiculousness ... that a cartoon
frog had become a hate symbol."" (Infowars Reply at 10-11). For support, Defendants cite to Mr. Allen's deposition

testimony. ( /d. at 11).

At the hearing, Plaintiff argued that testimony from Defendants’ own representatives indicate that the decision to sell the
MAGA poster was purely driven by profit, supporting a finding that Defendants’ use of the work is commercial in nature. The
Court agrees that Defendants' subjective belief has some relevance, but is not entirely convinced that such a subjective
belief is dispositive. Indeed, Nimmer's analysis is as follows:

Commentators champion additional factors as part of the fair use calculus ...
[401 F.Supp.3d 974]

and that fair use should be found for types of use that engender market failure. One frequent factor recognized
by courts relevant to the ""character"" of the use is the propriety of the defendant's conduct. Characterizing the fair
use doctrine as ""equitable,"" it has been held that defendant's unjustified denial of its use of the plaintiff's work is a
factor militating against permitting defendant to claim a fair use defense.... [But case law] betokens that an
inquiry into defendant's state of mind does not necessarily belong in the fair use calculus.

See 4 Nimmer on Copyright § 13.05[A][1][d] (2019) (citations omitted).

Regardless, the Court concludes that, at minimum, there are disputed issues of fact precluding summary judgment as to
whether the MAGA poster's use of Pepe the Frog was physically and contextually transformative. The parties have
presented widely conflicting evidence on the fair use defense that requires the Court to weigh credibility and resolve factual
disputes. And as already discussed, these factual disputes and credibility determination are more appropriately left to the
jury rather than determined by the Court on summary judgment.

Accordingly, because of numerous factual disputes as to physical and contextual transformative nature of Pepe the Frog,


--- Page 13 ---
this factor does not weigh in favor of a finding of fair use as a matter of law ; the jury may conclude that the factor does
favor fair use.

2. Nature of the copyrighted work

The second factor acknowledges that ""some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with

the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 586 ,
114 S.Ct. 1164 . ""Works that are creative in nature are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than are more

fact-based works."" Kelly_. 336 F.3d at 820 (quoting A & M Records_, 239 F.3d at 1016).

Defendants argue that the nature of Pepe the Frog is ""somewhat unique,"" because the character ""took on a life of its own""
when it became a meme. (Infowars Mot. at 14). Defendants argue that the ""meme-ification of the character"" was widespread
and far different than how Pepe the Frog was depicted in the comics, weighing in favor of a finding of fair use. ( /d.). At the
hearing, Defendants reiterated that the nature of Pepe the Frog changed dramatically once the character became ""meme-
fied"" and numerous third parties began using the character.

The Court disagrees because Defendants have not pointed to any authority for the proposition that ""meme- ification"" of an
image or character destroys or diminishes the original author's copyright interest. ( See Infowars Opp. at 13). Indeed,
Plaintiff's original creation and depiction of Pepe the Frog and subsequent creation of Pepe in Blue Shirt are creative works
that fall within the core of copyright protection, as discussed above. Indeed, ""[n]o matter how popular a character may
become, the copyright owner is entitled to guard against the unauthorized commercial exploitation of that character."" See
United Feature Syndicate, Inc. v. Koons , 817 F. Supp. 370 , 380-81 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (concluding that since Odie, Garfield's
canine companion, is ""a fictional, imaginative work, the second factor strongly militates against finding the Koons' use of that
character in his sculpture constituted a fair use"").

But because this factor has been described as ""not ... terribly significant in the overall fair use balancing,"" it carries little
weight. See Mattel, Inc. v. Walking Mountain Prods. , 353 F.3d 792 , 803 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that ""Mattel's copyrighted

[401 F.Supp.3d 975]

Barbie figure and face can fairly be said to be a creative work,"" but concluding that parodies, like the defendant's allegedly
infringing works, ""almost invariably copy publicly known, expressive works"") (citations omitted).

Accordingly, this factor marginally weighs against a finding of fair use as a matter of law.

3. Amount and substantiality of the portion used

Under the third factor, the Court evaluates the amount of the work used. The Supreme Court in Campbell explained that the
third factor inquires as to whether the ""amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a
whole ... [is] reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" 510 U.S. at 586 -87, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . The attention ""turns
to the persuasiveness of a parodist's justification for the particular copying done, and the enquiry will harken back to the first
of the statutory factors, for, as in prior cases, we recognize that the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose
and character of the use."" /d.

Defendants offer the same arguments they offer in connection with the purpose and character factor. Specifically,
Defendants note that ""the use of a single depiction of Pepe, dissimilar from the vast majority of drawings [Plaintiff] made of
the character,"" and the use of ""a third party's drawing as a reference"" were ""necessary for the authorial purpose of the
MAGA [ploster."" (Infowars Mot. at 16-17; see Infowars Reply at 14-15). And like before, Defendants also note that Mr. Allen
""included Pepe in the MAGA [p]oster to comment on the use of memes in the 2016 presidential election and the prominent
role that the Pepe meme played during that election,"" as well as to comment on the ""absurdity of the 2016 election,
particularly the absurdity that a cartoon frog played such a prominent role ...."" ( /d. at 16).

For the reasons already discussed, the Court concludes that there are numerous disputed issues of fact that preclude the
use of this factor to grant summary judgment.

4. Effect of use on the market

The fourth factor is the ""effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107(4).
The Supreme Court has stated that this factor is ""the single most important element of fair use."" Harper & Row Publishers.
471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . ""Fair use, when properly applied, is limited to copying by others which does not materially
impair the marketability of the work which is copied."" /d. at 566-67, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (quoting 1 Nimmer on Copyright §
1.10[D] ).

As with other factors, the Court concludes that the parties have presented conflicting evidence that raises disputed issues of
facts to preclude summary judgment.

For instance, Defendants point to the fact that Pepe the Frog and the MAGA posters are not market substitutes, and that, if
anything, Pepe the Frog's ""association with political conservatives skyrocketed"" its popularity. (Infowars Mot. at 17-19).
Defendants also point out that ""it does not appear that there was any sort of delayed negative impact on [Plaintiff's] licensing


--- Page 14 ---
market caused by this rightwing affiliation, either, since [he] was recently able to secure an equally lucrative licensing
agreement with another company for Pepe the Frog."" (Infowars Mot. at 18, Ex. 1).

Plaintiff contends that he ""has an active practice of licensing Pepe for use in derivative works,"" suggesting that there is ""a
market for posters featuring his work."" (Infowars Opp. at 15-16). Plaintiff also argues

401 F.Supp.3d 976]

hat Pepe the Frog's association with the MAGA posters ""harms the market for derivative works"" and that connection is

something Plaintiff ""specifically does not approve of."" ( /d. at 16). For support, Plaintiff points to his and Mr. Jones' deposition
estimonies.

Accordingly, this factor does not weigh in favor of finding of fair use as a matter of law, but it also does not necessarily weigh
against a finding of fair use. See, e.g. , Leadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music Pub. , 512 F.3d 522 , 530 (9th Cir. 2008) (recognizing
hat ""it is well established that a court can resolve the issue of fair use on a motion for summary judgment when no material
acts are in dispute"" and concluding that the conflicting allegations and evidence ""do not support a finding of fair use"").

Weighing the four factors together, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law, especially in light of numerous conflicting
actual disputes, that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on their defense of fair use.

Stepping back from the factors, the argument at the hearing by counsel for Defendants was, essentially, that controversial
defendants should not have their defense of fair use decided by the jury; i.e. , there must be some sort of First Amendment
overlay on copyright law to protect political speech. By analogy, counsel was arguing for the creation for copyright law of
something like New York Times Co. v. Sullivan for the law of defamation. That simply is not the law as this Court
understands it.

Accordingly, the Infowars Motion is DENIED to the extent it seeks summary judgment on fair use.

C. Abandonment and Implied License

Defendants argue that the public statements made by Plaintiff showed a clear intention to abandon Pepe the Frog, and even
if there is no abandonment, Plaintiff's ""knowledge and acquiescence of the global use of Pepe the Frog constitutes an
implied license."" (Infowars. Mot. at 20-23; see Reply at 20-21). Defendants' arguments are identical to the ones they raised
in opposing the Furie Motion.

As to the affirmative defense of abandonment, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that Defendants are entitled to
summary judgment for the reasons already discussed. See supra. It is evident that a genuine issue of material fact remains
in dispute as to what Plaintiff's intention was when he made various public statements. As to the affirmative defense of an
implied license, Defendants do not explain why Plaintiff's public statements constitute an offer that is supported by
consideration.

Accordingly, the Infowars Motion is DENIED to the extent it seeks summary judgment on the affirmative defenses of
abandonment and implied license.

D. Statutory Damages and Attorneys’ Fees

Defendants argue that Plaintiff is precluded from seeking statutory damages and attorneys’ fees under 17 U.S.C. § 412.
(Infowars Mot. at 23). Here, both parties agree on the law. ( /d. ; Infowars Opp. at 24 (""As to statutory damages, Infowars
has the law right ...."").

Section 412(2) provides that, in order to recover statutory damages, the copyrighted work must have been registered prior
to commencement of the infringement, unless the registration is made within three months after first publication of the work.
17 U.S.C. § 412(2). Where a defendant commits some infringing acts before registration, and others after, the availability of
statutory damages and attorneys' fees turns on whether there is a

[401 F.Supp.3d 977]

""legally significant difference between [the infringer's] pre and post-registration infringement.""_Derek Andrew, Inc. v. Poof
Apparel Corp. , 528 F.3d 696 , 701 (9th Cir. 2008).

Defendants point out that Plaintiff created Pepe the Frog in 2003; his latest date of first publication is December 20, 2016;
and he did not seek registration until September 2017 at the earliest. (Infowars Mot. at 23). Defendants then argue that
because the alleged infringement did not commence until April 23, 2017, Plaintiff ""sought registration more than 3 months
after even the latest initial publication of his alleged works."" ( /d. at 24).

In response, Plaintiff argues that Defendants are incorrect that there is a legally significant difference between pre- and post-
registration infringement. Plaintiff explains that, pre-registration, Defendants ""sold a first version of the MAGA [p]oster for
$17.76."" (Infowars Opp. at 24). Post-registration, Defendants then ""sold a new ‘Limited edition MAGA poster,’ which it
expressly marketed as infringing, which it advertised as now including Alex Jones's autograph, and for which it charged
$29.95."" ( Id. ). Plaintiff finally argues that, at a minimum, ""whether the pre- and post-registration MAGA Posters are


--- Page 15 ---
sufficiently different is a disputed issue of fact."" ( /d. at 25). The Court disagrees.

As an initial matter, some of Plaintiff's contentions are incorrect. For instance, both the pre- and post-registration versions of
the MAGA poster were advertised as ""limited edition."" In addition, Plaintiff's contention that the post-registration poster was
""expressly marketed as infringing"" based on the language that Defendants will ""be forced to take it down forever"" is
misleading. The actual description of the post-registration poster is as follows:

Limited edition MAGA poster by renowned artist and patriot Jon Allen exclusively available through Infowars.
There's only a few hundred left on this final run — we'll be forced to take it down forever when we run out, so
make sure you get this collectible poster today !

(Docket No. 96-17 (emphasis in original).

Finally, the post-registration poster was also not advertised as including Alex Jones' autograph. Nor is there any evidence
that Alex Jones ever signed any copies of the poster. Indeed, David Jones testified as follows:

Q: How many — how many poster — how many MAGA posters do you still have left?
A: | think we have like 270.

Q: And where are those posters located?

A: They're in the warehouse sequestered in our quarantine area.

Q: Where is the warehouse?

A: It's about a half a mile from here over on Stassney.

Q: Are any of those posters signed by Alex Jones?

A: | don't think so. | don't think he signed any of them.
(Infowars Reply, Ex. 4 at 104:4-16 (Docket No. 102-4) (emphasis added)).

Here, it appears that Plaintiff has pointed only to a difference in price, from $17.76 to $29.95. The pre- and post-registration
posters are otherwise identical. But based solely on the difference in price, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to
show a legally significant difference between the pre- and post-registration posters.

Indeed, even where there are differences between pre- and post-registration works, other district courts have concluded that
there is no legally significant difference. See, e.g. ,

[401 F.Supp.3d 978]

New Name, Inc. v. The Walt Disney Co. , No. 07-CV-5034-PA (RZx), 2008 WL 5587487, at “5 (C.D. Cal. July 23, 2008)
(concluding that where ""the same allegedly infringing design applied to two products that differ only with respect to an
emblem on the sleeve of a t-shirt"" did not ""commence a new infringement under § 412 ); Dyer v. Napier, No. CIV A 06-0011,
2006 WL 680551, at *4 (D. Ariz. Mar.16, 2006) (holding that post-registration customizing of an allegedly infringing sculpture
by changing its size, surface texture, pedestals size, and defendants’ copies ""were sold for varying prices"" did not
commence a new infringement under § 412 );_City of Carlsbad v. Shah, 850 F. Supp. 2d 1087 , 1103 (S.D. Cal. 2012)
(finding that defendant's use of logo on various web sites, business cards, letterheads, t-shirts, and hats ""arose out of [the
defendant's] initial infringement and any post-registration conduct is therefore traceable to [the defendant's] pre-registration
conduct"" precluding statutory damages).

At the hearing, Plaintiff argued that there are significant factual disputes that it would be inappropriate to resolve against
him. Plaintiff pointed to disputes about the number of posters, how they were advertised, and Alex Jones' comment on his
show that he would sign the posters. But these are not disputes of material facts and, as noted above, numerous other
district courts have concluded no legally significant difference between pre-and post-registration works even where there are

differences. More significantly, Defendants’ post-registration infringement ( i.e. , continued sales the MAGA poster) is directly
traceable to their pre-registration conduct ( i.e. , sales of the same MAGA poster).

As the Ninth Circuit has explained, each separate act of infringement of the same kind, like here, does not mark the
""commencement"" of a new infringement within the meaning of § 412 ; rather, the infringement is part of an ongoing,
continuing infringement. Derek Andrew__ 528 F.3d at 701 .

Accordingly, the Infowars Motion is GRANTED to the extent it seeks summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for statutory
damages and attorneys’ fees.

VI. CONCLUSION


--- Page 16 ---
The Furie Motion and Infowars Motion are both GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

As discussed above, by May 29, 2019 , Defendants are ORDERED to report when they came into possession of Exhibits 2—
12, 14-15, 17, and 18 to the Furie Opposition and Exhibits 10-13, 15-21, 26-27, 37, and 43 to the Infowars Motion, and
when they formed the intention to use these exhibits as evidence in this action.

As it did at the hearing, the Court commends counsel on the efforts that they put into the briefing and oral argument on the
two motions.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

Appeals from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
Before: SNEED, CANBY, and FERNANDEZ, Circuit Judges.
SNEED, Circuit Judge:

Southeastern Express Company (""Southeastern"") appeals the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction in favor of
Triad Systems Corporation (""Triad""). The injunction followed a finding that Southeastern was infringing on Triad's software
copyrights. 1

Page 1333

The terms of the injunction substantially prohibit Southeastern from servicing Triad computer systems. In a consolidated
appeal, two of Triad's attorneys, Jeffrey Lederman and Michael Madison (""Lederman and Madison""), appeal the imposition
of Rule 11 sanctions against them for filing a misleading declaration in support of Triad's motion for injunctive relief.

For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction against Southeastern and reverse
the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions against Lederman and Madison.

I.
FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW

Triad manufactures computers for use by automotive parts stores and designs, sells, and licenses unique software to
run its computers. The computer systems enable customers in the automotive parts industry to automate their sales,
inventory, and accounting tasks. Southeastern is what is known as an independent service organization (""ISO"") that services
Triad computers. ? Southeastern and Triad thus compete for the business of servicing and maintaining Triad computers. The


--- Page 2 ---
crux of Triad's complaint is that Southeastern has infringed on its software copyrights and continues to do so by performing
maintenance on Triad computer systems for Triad's licensees.

Triad's copyrighted software includes: (1) operating system software, which is necessary to run any other program on
the computer (""OS software""); (2) applications software, which performs the basic functions like accounting and invoicing for
the Triad customer; and (3) utilities, diagnostic, and auxiliary software, which is used by technicians to repair Triad software
and hardware (""service software""). The OS software and the service software are involved in this dispute.

Triad software customers are subject to three different contractual arrangements. From 1976 to 1985, Triad sold its
software outright to customers (""Regime 1""). Because Regime 1 customers own their software, they have rights under the
Copyright Act to make or authorize the making of copies in the operation of their computers. ° As a result, such copies are
noninfringing, even if they are made by Southeastern in the course of servicing Regime 1 customers' computers. Triad
therefore concedes that Southeastern cannot be barred from making use of software owned by Regime 1 customers.

In 1986, however, Triad began licensing rather than selling its software (""Regime 2""). Under Regime 2 agreements,
customers may not duplicate the software or allow it to be used by third parties. In 1991, Triad added a requirement that
licensees selling their computer systems pay Triad a license transfer fee (""Regime 3""). Thus, Southeastern's performance of
service and maintenance on the computer systems of Regime 2 and 3 customers is at issue. At stake is the business of
servicing these systems.

In order to service a Triad computer, the Southeastern technician uses the OS software and the service software in the
Triad customer's possession. Triad argues that Southeastern has infringed its software copyrights because copies of the
software are made in the computer's random access memory (RAM) when the computer is in use. 4

Triad filed suit against Southeastern in federal district court in April 1992. A year later, while discovery was ongoing,
this Circuit decided MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511 , 518 (9th Cir.1993), cert. dismissed, --- U.S. ----,
114 S.Ct. 671 , 126 L.Ed.2d 640 (1994) . There we held that

Page 1334

the loading of MAI's operating system software into RAM makes a ""copy"" under the Copyright Act, and that therefore Peak,
an ISO, had infringed MAI's copyright by operating its customers’ MAI computers in order to service them. 5

Following the MAI decision, Triad understandably moved for summary judgment on its copyright infringement claim.
Southeastern moved for summary judgment on its fair use and copyright misuse defenses. Both motions were denied. ® The
district court ordered that the trial be bifurcated: Phase One would include Triad's copyright infringement claims, damages,
and Southeastern's fair use defense; Phase Two would include Southeastern's copyright misuse defense and any remaining
counterclaims.

Phase One proceeded before a jury on January 12, 1995. At the close of the evidence, the district court granted
directed verdicts in favor of Triad on Southeastern's fair use defense to infringement of both the OS software and the
service software. Then, on February 3, the jury found that Southeastern had infringed Triad's software copyrights.

On March 15, 1995, the district court granted Triad's motion for a preliminary injunction. 7 This was a long step forward
for Triad. In essence, the injunction bars Southeastern from performing service or maintenance on Triad computer systems
that contain licensed software. § Under the terms of the injunction, the onus is on Southeastern to determine whether a
particular customer's software is subject to a Regime 2 or 3 license agreement. Triad, however, is obligated to provide the
license agreement upon the customer's written request; if it fails to do so within ten business days, Southeastern may
service the customer's computer without violating the injunction.

A panel of this court stayed the injunction pending this appeal. While Phase Two of the trial remains in progress, on
June 8, 1995, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Triad on Southeastern's copyright misuse claim. Only
a few remaining claims are as yet unresolved.

Southeastern timely appeals the preliminary injunction. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)

(1).
I.

DISCUSSION
A. Preliminary Injunction

Southeastern, attacking the preliminary injunction in several ways, argues that (1) Triad cannot show the possibility of
irreparable injury, (2) Triad cannot show the likelihood of success on the merits because of Southeastern's meritorious
affirmative defenses, (3) the preliminary injunction is too broad and will harm Southeastern, and (4) the district court erred in
bifurcating the trial.

A district court's order granting preliminary injunctive relief is subject to limited review: It will be reversed only where the
district court abused its discretion or based its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of
fact. Miller v. California Pac. Medical Cir., 19 F.3d 449 , 455 (9th Cir.1994) (en banc).



--- Page 3 ---
To obtain a preliminary injunction in this case, Triad must show a likelihood of success on the merits of its copyright
infringement action and the possibility of irreparable injury. See Oakland Tribune, Inc. v. Chronicle Publishing Co., 762 F.2d
1374 , 1376 (9th Cir.1985) (quoting Apple Computer, Inc. v. Formula Int'l, Inc., 725 F.2d 521 , 523 (9th Cir.1984)).

1. Irreparable Injury.
Southeastern first argues that Triad cannot show a threat of irreparable injury sufficient
Page 1335

to merit injunctive relief. Southeastern, mindful of the economic stakes involved, argues that Triad will suffer only monetary
damages from lost revenues, which are not usually considered irreparable harm because of the availability of an adequate
legal remedy. Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n v. National Football League, 634 F.2d 1197 , 1202 (9th Cir.1980).

In a copyright infringement action, however, the rules are somewhat different. A showing of a reasonable likelihood of
success on the merits raises a presumption of irreparable harm. Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Phoenix Control Sys., Inc., 886
F.2d 1173 , 1174 (9th Cir.1989).° The cases to the contrary cited by Southeastern are not controlling and are
distinguishable. 1° Thus, Triad need only show a reasonable likelihood of success on its copyright infringement claim to
support the district court's grant of the preliminary injunction. Id.

2. Likelihood of Success on the Merits.

To make its required showing of copyright infringement, Triad must prove (1) ownership of the copyrights and (2)
copying of an expression protected by those copyrights. Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at 1175 . Triad has shown both. Its
ownership of valid copyrights is apparently not in dispute; Triad has produced certificates of registration, '' which raise a
presumption of the validity of Triad's copyrights in its software. 17 U.S.C. Sec. 410(c).

Triad, to show that Southeastern made copies of its protected works, relies on the MAI decision. It is clear that
Southeastern's activities are ""copying"" for purposes of the Copyright Act. MAI, 991 F.2d at 519 . Because Southeastern's
service activities involved copying entire programs, there is no doubt that protected elements of the software were copied.
Sega Enters. Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 , 1525 (9th Cir.1992). Therefore, Triad has shown a likelihood of success
as to its prima facie case.

3. Fair Use. 12

Southeastern argues that, despite Triad's carrying its burden, the preliminary injunction was improper because the
district

Page 1336

court failed to consider adequately its affirmative defenses of fair use and copyright misuse. '? Because those defenses are
clearly meritorious, Southeastern asserts, Triad cannot show that it is likely to succeed on the merits. See Gould v. Lambert
Excavating, Inc.. 870 F.2d 1214 , 1218 (7th Cir.1989).

We agree with the district court that the doctrine of fair use does not apply given the facts of this case. ""The doctrine of
fair use allows a holder of the privilege to use copyrighted material in a reasonable manner without the consent of the
copyright owner."" Narell v. Freeman, 872 F.2d 907 , 913 (9th Cir.1989) (citing Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enters.. 471 U.S. 539 , 549, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 2224-25, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) ); see 17 U.S.C. Sec. 107. 14 Southeastern
relies on the rationale of Sega v. Accolade, supra, to find that its service activities are a fair use of Triad's copyrighted
software.

Sega, however, was a very different case. There, the defendant, Accolade, had made copies of Sega's video game
programs in the process of reverse-engineering them solely in order to figure out the requirements for compatibility with
Sega's ""Genesis"" game console. The functional requirements of compatibility were not protected by copyright, and there was
no other method available to Accolade to discover those requirements. 977 F.2d at 1522 . This court held that the copying at
issue was a fair use. We determined (1) that Accolade had made the copies ""for a legitimate, essentially non-exploitative
purpose,"" that is, determining the compatibility requirements; (2) that the copying resulted in the proliferation of independent,
creative expression, by making Accolade game programs compatible with the Sega Genesis system, an outcome the
Copyright Act was intended to promote; and (3) that the copying neither adversely affected the market for Sega's own video
games, nor pirated those games, but only used the unprotected elements needed to make its own games compatible. Id. at
1523.

Southeastern's activities are wholly unlike the reverse-engineering in Sega. Southeastern did not make a minimal use
of Triad's programs solely to achieve compatibility with Triad's computers for Southeastern's own creative programs. Rather,
Southeastern has invented nothing of its own; its use of Triad's software is, in the district court's words, ""neither creative nor
transformative and does not provide the marketplace with new creative works."" '5 See id. at 1523.

Page 1337

Southeastern is simply commandeering its customers' software and using it for the very purpose for which, and in precisely
the manner in which, it was designed to be used. As a result, the copies made by Southeastern while servicing Triad


--- Page 4 ---
computers have undoubtedly diminished the value of Triad's copyright. See id. As the district court reasoned: ""If ISOs like
Southeastern freely used Triad's copyrighted software on a widespread basis to compete with Triad, this would likely cause
a significant adverse impact on Triad's licensing and service revenues and lower returns on its copyrighted software
investment."" '° To allow Southeastern to use Triad's software as it wishes would cause Triad to lose licensing revenues from
the ISOs, who ""have a substantial motivation to obtain access"" to Triad's software. '” See Advanced Computer Serv.. Inc. v.
MAI Sys. Corp., 845 F.Supp. 356 , 366 (E.D.Va.1994). In short, we detect no appreciable public benefit arising from
Southeastern's practice to justify this continuance under the fair use doctrine. See Sega, 977 F.2d at 1523 . We therefore
agree with the district court's thoughtful analysis and its rejection of Southeastern's fair use claim.

Southeastern also contends that the district court's analysis was flawed because Triad's copyright does not extend to
the service market. We disagree. Triad invented, developed, and marketed its software to enable its customers and its own
technicians to service Triad computers. Southeastern is getting a free ride when it uses that software to perform precisely
the same service. Triad is entitled to licensing fees from Southeastern and other ISOs that make use of Triad's software in
servicing Triad computers. Furthermore, a finding of fair use is unwarranted because the other relevant factors weigh
against such a finding. Not only is Southeastern's use of Triad's software entirely commercial in nature, see Sega, 977 F.2d
at 1522 , but also both the OS and the service software are protected expression, and Southeastern is copying programs in
their entirety, see id. at 1526. See Advanced Computer Serv., 845 F.Supp. at 366 n. 13.

4. Copyright Misuse.

Not surprisingly, we also conclude that Southeastern cannot show that it is likely to prevail on its asserted copyright
misuse defense. The district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim in favor of Triad. It found that, unlike the
case of Lasercomb America. Inc. v. Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970 , 978-79 (4th Cir.1990), Triad did not attempt to prohibit
Southeastern or any other ISO from developing its own service software to compete with Triad. District Court's Order of
June 8, 1995, at 7; see also Advanced Computer, 845 F.Supp. at 366-67 . We agree.

5. Overbreadth and Harm to Southeastern.

Southeastern's most plausible claim, that the injunction is too broad because it effectively prevents Southeastern from
engaging in legitimate service activities even for Regime 1 customers, also fails. We find that Southeastern is not prevented
from performing such service; rather, the injunction properly requires Southeastern to determine which customers own their
software under Regime 1, and which are mere licensees under Regimes 2 and 3. Putting this burden on Southeastern is
appropriate because Southeastern is the infringer. 18

Were Triad able to obscure or manipulate which machines fell under which types of agreement, our attitude with
respect to this issue might have been different. But that is not the case. The injunction requires Triad to ascertain the status
of any computer that Southeastern seeks to service, and it allows Southeastern to perform such service without violating the
injunction where Triad fails to provide the requested information. We find that this arrangement is sufficient to prevent any
abuse. Therefore, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the injunction.

Page 1338

Southeastern, we suppose accurately enough, argues that the injunction will cause it to suffer extensive harm as a
result. Nonetheless, the argument fails. Southeastern cannot complain of the harm that will befall it when properly forced to
desist from its infringing activities. ""Where the only hardship that the defendant will suffer is lost profits from an activity which
has been shown likely to be infringing, such an argument in defense 'merits little equitable consideration [on an appeal from
a preliminary injunction].'"" Concrete Mach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., 843 F.2d 600 , 612 (1st Cir.1988); accord
Apple Computer, 714 F.2d at 1255 (in motion for preliminary injunction, district court should not consider the ""devastating
effect"" of the injunction on the infringer's business).

6. Bifurcation.

Finally, Southeastern contends that the district court erred in dividing the trial into two phases, one involving the
copyright action and the other involving Southeastern's antitrust counterclaims. We review that decision by way of an abuse
of discretion standard. Exxon Co. v. Sofec, Inc., 54 F.3d 570 , 575 (9th Cir.1995), petition for cert. filed, 64 U.S.L.W. 3070
(July 24, 1995) (No. 95-129). Southeastern claims that bifurcation prevented consideration of its copyright misuse defense
and antitrust claims in conjunction with the infringement action. This was error, Southeastern argues, because its
counterclaims will affect the outcome of the case. Once more, we must reject Southeastern's argument.

As Triad correctly points out, a party seeking a preliminary injunction ordinarily is granted relief before trial. That is its
purpose. Therefore, the fact that some claims in this case have already been reached and others not is irrelevant to the
issuance of a preliminary injunction. Furthermore, Triad's copyright infringement claim and Southeastern's antitrust claims
are discrete issues, involving separate, complex bodies of law. The district court justifiably did not want the jury to muddle
the two. There was no abuse of discretion.

B. Rule 11 Sanctions

We turn now to Lederman's and Madison's appeal regarding the sanctions imposed on them under Rule 11 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

1. Facts.


--- Page 5 ---
In October 1992, Triad, in a then unsuccessful motion for a preliminary injunction against Southeastern, supported its
motion with the declaration of David Mullen, Triad's field service coordinator (""the Mullen declaration""). Ten months later,
Southeastern deposed Mullen and questioned him at length about his declaration. Mullen had difficulty answering questions
and at times contradicted his declaration statements.

As a result, Southeastern filed a motion seeking sanctions under Rule 11 and the court's inherent powers against Triad
and both its present counsel, McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen, and its former counsel, Ware & Friedenrich, which had
represented Triad during the preliminary injunction motion. McCutchen, Doyle filed a motion in opposition, arguing that,
under the applicable version of Rule 11, sanctions could only be imposed against the person signing the document and not
against a law firm generally.

On April 7, 1994, the district court granted Southeastern's motion. Acknowledging that it could not sanction the law firm,
Ware & Friedenrich, the district court instead imposed Rule 11 sanctions of $500 each against Lederman and Madison, the
attorneys involved in the preparation of the Mullen declaration.

2. Jurisdiction.

To forestall an argument on the merits, Southeastern first contends that this court lacks jurisdiction over an appeal from
the imposition of sanctions. This is incorrect. We have jurisdiction over the appeal under the collateral order doctrine. Opty!
Eyewear Fashion Int'l Corp. v. Style Cos., 760 F.2d 1045 , 1047 n. 1 (9th Cir.1985). An order imposing Rule 11 sanctions
upon counsel, a nonparty, is final and appealable by the attorney sanctioned upon imposition of the sanction. Rachel v.
Banana Republic, Inc.,

Page 1339
831 F.2d 1503 , 1508 n. 5 (9th Cir.1987); Optyl Eyewear, 760 F.2d at 1047 n. 1.
3. Merits.

Lederman and Madison argue that the district court erred by sanctioning them. They maintain that under the then-
current version of Rule 11, only a person whose signature was on the declaration could be subject to sanctions.
Southeastern, on the other hand, insists that sanctions were appropriate because Lederman and Madison were actively
involved in the preparation of the misleading declaration, and because Triad's brief, which did bear their signatures, was
misleading inasmuch as it relied heavily on the Mullen declaration. We find that the order imposing sanctions on Lederman
and Madison was improper and cannot stand. 19

Until Rule 11 was amended in 1993, subsequent to the Mullen declaration, a bright-line rule applied: Only the individual
attorney who actually signed the court paper could be sanctioned because of its contents. Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel
Entertainment Group. 493 U.S. 120 , 110 S.Ct. 456 , 107 L.Ed.2d 438 (1989) ; Giebelhaus v. Spindrift Yachts, 938 F.2d 962
, 965 (9th Cir.1991); see also id. at 966 (holding that an attorney's typewritten name on a pleading is not a signature for
purposes of Rule 11 and therefore does not subject him to sanctions). As the Supreme Court has explained:

We held in Pavelic & LeFlore that Rule 11 contemplates sanctions against the particular individual who signs his or her
name, not against the law firm of which that individual is a member, because ""the purpose of Rule 11 as a whole is to bring
home to the individual signer his personal, nondelegable responsibility ... to validate the truth and legal reasonableness of
the papers filed.""

Business Guides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 546-47, 111 S.Ct. 922 , 930-31, 112
L.Ed.2d 1140 (1991) (quoting Pavelic & LeFlore, 493 U.S. at 126 , 110 S.Ct. at 459-60 ) (emphasis added); 2° see also
Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 (""Every pleading, written motion, and other paper of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at
least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name...."") (emphasis added) (prior to 1993 amendment).

Inasmuch as Lederman and Madison did not sign the Mullen declaration, they cannot be sanctioned based on its
misleading nature. 2! Southeastern nonetheless urges us to uphold the sanctions order because Triad's brief, which Madison
apparently did sign, must also have been misleading because it relied heavily on the Mullen declaration. We need not
consider whether the district court could have chosen to sanction Lederman and Madison on this basis, because it did not.
The district court's order is based exclusively on the misleading nature of the Mullen declaration. 22 No factual findings were
made regarding

Page 1340

Triad's brief or any other paper filed in this action. Furthermore, the district court clearly stated that it was sanctioning
Lederman and Madison under Rule 11 and not under the court's inherent powers. As a result, there is no available
alternative basis for upholding the sanctions. We must set aside the sanctions imposed on Lederman and Madison.

AFFIRMED AS TO THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION; REVERSED AS TO THE IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.

1 Southeastern also attempts to raise several issues regarding Phase One of the trial in this case; however, because the trial is still underway and no


--- Page 6 ---
final judgment has been entered, see Appellants’ Excerpts of Record (""E.R."") at 134, these issues are premature and not properly before this court on
appeal. See Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 54(b); Williams v. St. Louis Diecasting Corp., 611 F.2d 1223 (8th Cir.1979) .

2 Southeastern also deals in used Triad computers and replacement parts; however, these activities are not at issue on this appeal. The district court
granted summary judgment in favor of Triad on Southeastern's claims of tying and monopolization with respect to the spare parts market. E.R. at 100-07.

3 See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 117.

4 Servicing of the computers can also involve other forms of copying: OS software and service software are sometimes copied onto the hard drive in the
first instance, and thereafter booted up in RAM, and Southeastern technicians also make backup copies for customers by copying programs off the hard
drives onto tapes. See E.R. at 79-81.

5 Peak did not raise a fair use defense, so the issue is not discussed in the MAI opinion.
6 Both parties also sought preliminary injunctions at that time, which were likewise denied.
7 Injunctive relief is specifically authorized by the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 502.

8 It also bars Southeastern from distributing licensed Triad software in the course of selling used Triad computer systems and from performing any
hardware upgrades on Triad computer systems that contain licensed software.

9 ""A copyright plaintiff who makes out a prima facie case of infringement is entitled to a preliminary injunction without a detailed showing of irreparable
harm."" Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240 , 1254 (3d Cir.1983), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 1033 , 104 S.Ct. 690 , 79
L.Ed.2d 158 (1984) ; see also Rent-A-Center, Inc. v. Canyon Television & Appliance Rental, Inc., 944 F.2d 597 , 603 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that
intangible injuries, such as damage to advertising efforts and goodwill, can be irreparable harm for purpose of a preliminary injunction).

10 The case most on point is Belushi v. Woodward, 598 F.Supp. 36 (D.D.C.1984) . There, the plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction to prevent sale of a
book that contained her copyrighted photograph. The court denied a preliminary injunction despite the plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits,
reasoning that the potential harm to defendants from preventing sale of the book was greater than the harm to plaintiff from allowing its sale, that the
legal remedy would be adequate, and that the public interest in free expression weighed against injunctive relief. Id. at 37. Here, there is no compelling
free speech interest; as the Belushi court noted, ""If this were a case in which relief would enjoin the distribution of an average commercial product, [such]
relief would not be so drastic."" Id. Moreover, the entire software programs at issue are infringing, as compared to a single photograph out of an entire
book, and thus the injunction here does not substantially impinge on legitimate, noninfringing activity.

Southeastern's other citations are less pertinent. See LucasArts Entertainment Co. v. Humongous Entertainment Co., 815 F.Supp. 332 , 334, 337
(N.D.Cal.1993) (denying a preliminary injunction because plaintiff failed to show a likelihood of success on its copyright infringement claim); Love v.
Kwitny, 772 F.Supp. 1367 , 1375 (S.D.N.Y.1991) (denying a permanent injunction where the infringement was minimal and the “injurious consequences
to Love's copyright from continued circulation of Kwitny's book [were], if anything, 'trifling.'""), aff'd, 963 F.2d 1521 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113.
S.Ct. 181 , 121 L.Ed.2d 127 (1992) .

11 See Appellee's Supplemental Excerpts of Record (""S.R."") at 364-439.

12 This issue reaches us in a rather strange posture: Before the district court issued the preliminary injunction, it substantially had decided the fair use
issue in favor of Triad by granting it a directed verdict during Phase One of the trial. As a result, Southeastern faces great adverse odds in attempting to
argue that Triad cannot show the likelihood of success on the merits. Nonetheless, we proceed to examine the fair use issue to show that the district
court did not commit reversible error in its analysis of Southeastern's fair use defense in deciding to issue the preliminary injunction.

Southeastern also tries to argue that the district court erred in granting a directed verdict in favor of Triad on the fair use issue. However, that issue is not
properly before the court at this time because the case has not yet reached a final judgment. See Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 54(b); Williams, 611 F.2d 1223 .

13 Southeastern also argues that the district court erred by failing to consider its antitrust counterclaims in its decision to issue the preliminary injunction.

It appears, however, that the district court was not even obliged to consider such counterclaims once Triad showed the likelihood of success on its
copyright infringement claim. See Helene Curtis Indus. v. Church & Dwight Co., 560 F.2d 1325 , 1335 (7th Cir.1977) (affirming grant of preliminary
injunction upon plaintiff's showing of likelihood of success on trademark infringement claim and rejecting defendant's argument that its antitrust
counterclaims should have precluded injunction; ""antitrust violations are not a general defense to a trademark infringement claim""), cert. denied, 434 U.S.
1070 , 98 S.Ct. 1252 , 55 L.Ed.2d 772 (1978) . Even assuming the district court should have considered them, however, Southeastern cannot prevail. The
district court explicitly found that the antitrust counterclaims were not likely to succeed on the merits when it rejected Southeastern's motion for a
preliminary injunction. See E.R. at 108-17. The district court's findings are neither clearly erroneous nor based on an erroneous legal standard. Miller, 19
F.3d at 455 .

14 The Copyright Act sets out four factors for determining whether a use is a fair use:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. Sec. 107.

15 E.R. at 466.

16 E.R. at 468.

17 Id. at 468-69.

18 This arrangement is also appropriate because it appears that the majority of Triad computer owners are subject to license agreements and do not own
their software outright under Regime 1.

19 Though this court reviews orders imposing Rule 11 sanctions for an abuse of discretion, “[a] district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it
based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law...."" Giebelhaus, 938 F.2d at 964 (quoting Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384 , 405, 110 S.Ct.
2447 2461, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990) ).

20 The Court extended this reasoning in Business Guides to apply the certification requirement of Rule 11 to represented parties who sign court papers,


--- Page 7 ---
even where they are not required to do so. 498 U.S. at 543 , 546-47, 111 S.Ct. at 930-31 .

21 Giebelhaus, 938 F.2d at 965 ; see also Pony Express Courier Corp. of Am. v. Pony Express Delivery Serv., 872 F.2d 317 , 319 (9th Cir.1989) (holding
that co-counsel who did not sign the answer could not be held liable under Rule 11 for its contents). Southeastern's argument that Lederman and
Madison were involved in the preparation of the declaration is to no avail. Southeastern relies heavily on a district court case, Mercury Serv., Inc. v. Allied
Bank of Texas, 117 F.R.D. 147 (C.D.Cal.1987), affid, 907 F.2d 154 (9th Cir.1990) . There, the court imposed sanctions under Rule 11 and its inherent
powers against both the bank and its counsel for filing the declaration of one of the bank's vice-presidents, which was later revealed not to be based on
personal knowledge. To the extent that the court's holding rests on its power under Rule 11 (which is not clear from the text of the decision), however,
the case is no longer good law in light of the Supreme Court's decisions in Pavelic & LeFlore and Business Guides. See Giebelhaus, 938 F.2d at 965
(""Absent a signature, [the attorney's] relationship to the litigation is irrelevant under the express terms of Rule 11."") (citing Pavelic & LeFlore ).

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

LaSHANN DeARCY HALL, United States District Judge:

Plaintiffs LMNOPI and Ta'Kaiya Blaney bring the instant action against Defendants XYZ Films LLC (""XYZ Films""), Netflix
LLC (""Netflix""), Amazon.com Inc. (""Amazon""), Apple Inc. (""Apple""), and Google LLC (""Google"") asserting a claim for false
endorsement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125. Separately, LMNOPI asserts a claim for copyright infringement
under the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. § 106 ; and Blaney asserts a state-law claim for violation of a right of publicity
under New York Civil Rights Law §§ 50 - 51. Defendants move pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.

BACKGROUND +

Blaney is an internationally-known ""indigenous activist,"" actress, and singer-songwriter. (Complaint (""Compl."") 4 12, ECF No.
1.) LMNOPI is an artist and activist nationally recognized for producing works that evince her commitment to human rights
and social justice. ( /d. 4 11.) One such work, a mural (the ""Mural"") on a building located at the intersection of Wycoff and
Starr Streets in Bushwick, Brooklyn depicts Blaney. ( /d. ) LMNOPI's ""tag,"" or artistic signature, is affixed to the bottom of the
Mural. ( /d. ¥ 33.) In March 2017, LMNOPI obtained a certificate of copyright for the Mural. ( /d. § 22.)

In January 2018, Plaintiffs discovered that the Mural had appeared, without their permission, in Bushwick (the ""Film""), a film
produced by Defendant XYZ Films. 2( /d. ¢ 13.) The Film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2017, was
released in theaters in August 2017, and was later distributed for streaming by Defendants Netflix, Amazon, and Google. (
Id. 4§ 13, 15.) Plaintiffs allege that the

[449 F.Supp.3d 90]

Mural appears for three-and-a-half seconds in the opening scene of the Film, in a full-screen shot, in perfect focus and
unobstructed to the viewer. ( /d. J 13.) Plaintiffs further allege that the Mural ""appears to have been intentionally selected for
the opening sequence of the [Film] because it is one of the oldest, most well-recognized graffiti murals in Bushwick and
visually locates the viewer at the Jefferson Street subway station in Bushwick."" ( /d. § 14.) According to Plaintiffs, the Film's
plot is antithetical to the message of peace that forms the bases of both Plaintiffs' work, and neither Plaintiff would have
agreed to be associated with it. ( /d. ¢ 16.) Also, according to Plaintiffs, Defendants intentionally avoided depicting other
murals in the neighborhood during the Film's opening sequence. ( /d. J 18.)

STANDARD OF REVIEW

To withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint ""must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to
‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’ "" Ashcroft v. Iqbal 556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868

(2009) (quoting_Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 , 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) ). A claim is facially
plausible when the alleged facts allow the court to draw a ""reasonable inference"" of defendants’ liability for the alleged
misconduct. /d. While this standard requires more than a ""sheer possibility"" of defendants' liability, id. , ""[iJt is not the [clourt's
function to weigh the evidence that might be presented at trial"" on a motion to dismiss. Morris v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
37 F. Supp. 2d 556 , 565 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). Instead, ""the [c]ourt must merely determine whether the complaint itself is legally
sufficient, and, in doing so, it is well settled that the court must accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true."" /d.

DISCUSSION
|. COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT


--- Page 2 ---
""The Copyright Act principally offers copyright protection for original works of authorship."" Keeling v. Hars , 809 F.3d 43 , 47—
48 (2d Cir. 2015) ; 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). Specifically, the Copyright Act grants copyright holders several rights with respect to
their copyrighted works, including the exclusive right to: (1) reproduce the copyrighted work in copies; (2) prepare derivative
works based on the copyrighted work; and (3) display the copyrighted work publicly. Perry v. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. , 765 F.
App'x 470, 471 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 106 ). To state a claim for copyright infringement, a plaintiff must
demonstrate that (1) she has a valid copyright, (2) which the defendant copied, and (3) the defendant's copying was illegal
because a substantial similarity exists between the allegedly infringing work and the protectable elements of the copyrighted
work. /d. at 471 (citing Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Dev. Corp. . 602 F.3d 57 , 63 (2d Cir. 2010) ).

Defendants do not dispute that LMNOPI has a valid copyright in the Mural, or that they copied the Mural. Defendants
maintain, rather, that LMNOPI has not established a sufficient similarity between the Mural and the Film to overcome
Defendants' motion to dismiss. (Defs.' Mot. 3.) The Court agrees. 3

[449 F.Supp.3d 91]

To demonstrate a substantial similarity, LMNOPI must show ""(i) that it was protected expression in the earlier work that was
copied[,] and (ii) that the amount that was copied is ‘more than de minimis.’ "" Gottlieb__590 F. Supp. 2d at 631 (quoting
Tufenkian Import/ Export Ventures, Inc. v. Einstein Moomjy, Inc., 338 F.3d 127 , 131 (2d Cir. 2003) ). Even where copying
undeniably occurs, courts nevertheless consider whether the copying was extensive enough to warrant litigation. Gottlieb
Development._590 F. Supp. 2d at 631 . That is, ""de minimis non curat lex—the law does not concern itself with trifles.""
Gottlieb Dev. LLC v. Paramount Pictures Corp. , 590 F. Supp. 2d 625 , 632 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (internal quotation marks
omitted) (quoting_Ringgold v. Black Entm't Television, Inc. , 126 F.3d 70 , 74 (2d Cir. 1997) ) (""Ringgold II""). Notably,
substantial similarity cannot be found where the copying falls below a qualitative and quantitative threshold of observability.
Id. While there are no bright line rules demarcating that threshold, courts are counseled to assess observability from the
viewpoint of an ""average lay observer"" considering ""the length of time the copyrighted work is observable, and other factors
such as focus, lighting, camera angles, and prominence."" Gayle v. Home Box Office, Inc. , No. 17-CV-5867, 2018 WL
2059657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 1, 2018), appeal dismissed , No. 18-1536, 2018 WL 6048022 (2d Cir. Sept. 13, 2018), cert.
denied , No. 18-9089, — U.S. ——, 139 S.Ct. 2709 , 204 L.Ed.2d 1099 , 2019 WL 2412932 (U.S. June 10, 2019).

Plaintiffs allege that ""the focus, lighting, camera angles, and prominence disfavor a finding of de minimis infringement.""
(Compl. ¥ 26.) To this point, LMNOPI argues in Plaintiffs' opposition that the Mural's prominence combined with its cinematic
clarity on screen, colorfulness, and distinctiveness is sufficient to meet the observability threshold necessary to demonstrate
a substantial similarity between the works. (PI.'s Opp. 6.) Not so. Indeed, Plaintiffs' description of the Mural as it appears in
the Film is grossly overstated. According to the complaint, the Mural is ""presented in a full-screen shot, in perfect focus, and
unobstructed to the viewer for several seconds."" (Compl. 4 13.) A review of the opening scene, however, reveals a work that
is far less observable than Plaintiffs contend. 4 During its brief cameo, the Mural appears one time for a total of
approximately three-and-a-half seconds of a film that runs 93 minutes. The Mural is at all times in the background.
Obscuring the view of at least one-third of the Mural rests a red pickup truck. In addition, throughout the entirety of the three-
and-a-half-second scene, an actress prominently positioned in the foreground runs about further obscuring the Mural. And,
contrary to Plaintiffs’ allegation that

[449 F.Supp.3d 92]

Defendants’ intentionally avoided depicting other murals in the neighborhood, (Compl. § 18), the Mural appears among
several other murals during the Film's opening sequence. In addition, the focus of the scene in which the Mural appears is
undeniably a female actress — not the Mural. The Mural is never referenced in the Film and is completely irrelevant to the
Film's plot.

This case is not unlike Gayle , 2018 WL 2059657. In that case, the court dismissed the plaintiff's copyright action finding in
part that ""the overall scene [was] brief, and the graffiti at issue appeared on screen for no more than two or three seconds[,]
... the graffiti [was] never pictured by itself ... and [the graffiti] play[ed] absolutely no role in the plot."" /d. at *3. Similarly, in
Gottlieb , the court held that the plaintiff did not have a plausible claim of copyright infringement because the copyrighted
material (1) appeared ""sporadically; for no more than a few seconds at a time"" during a scene that lasted only three-and-a-
half minutes; (2) always appeared in the background; (3) never appeared alone; (4) was never mentioned; and (5) played no
role in the movie's plot. 590 F. Supp. 2d at 632 . These facts are virtually identical to those present here.

In an attempt to persuade the Court to deny the instant motion, LMNOPI directs the Court to several cases in which courts
in this circuit have rejected a de minimis argument. (Pls. Opp. 4-5.) Defendants aptly distinguish those cases to reveal that
LMNOP''s reliance on them is misplaced. (Defs.' Reply. 1-3.) First, in the cases cited by LMNOPI, the copyrighted works
held prominent, unobstructed positions in the allegedly infringing works. Here, as discussed above, the Mural appears in the
background of the scene and in a partially obscured view. Second, the Mural appears only briefly, whereas in the cases
cited by LMNOPI, the copyrighted works appeared for greater portions of the entire challenged works. In Hirsch, the
copyrighted material appeared for four seconds of a 1:44 minute video, or, in other words, 3.8% of the total time. Hirsch v.
Complex Media, Inc. , No. 18 CV. 5488, 2018 WL 6985227 at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 2018). Similarly, in Twentieth Century
Fox , several clips of copyrighted material, each lasting less than three seconds, appeared in multiple short advertisements
made by the defendant. 5 Twentieth Century Fox, 155 F.Supp. 2d at 1. In Ringgold , copyrighted material appeared nine


--- Page 3 ---
times, cumulatively for approximately twenty-seven seconds of a twenty-four-minute television episode. Ringgold IL 126
F.3d at 73 . In Dyer, copyrighted material appeared for less than three seconds of a one-minute video. Dyer v. V.P. Records
Retail Outlet, Inc. , No. 05-CV-6583, 2008 WL 2876494, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 24, 2008). The 3.5 second appearance of the
Mural in a 93-minute film is simply not comparable.

Even if the use of the Mural in the Film could not be deemed de minimis , Defendants contend that its use was fair,
warranting dismissal. (Defs.' Mot. 8.) While ""[c]ourts most frequently address a proffered fair use defense at summary
judgment,"" the Second Circuit ""has acknowledged

[449 F.Supp.3d 93]

the possibility of fair use being so clearly established by a complaint as to support dismissal of a copyright infringement
claim."" TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum , 839 F.3d 168 , 178 (2d Cir. 2016). Such is the case here. When analyzing
whether an alleged infringement is fair use, courts consider: ""(1) the purpose and character of the use; (2) the nature of the
copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential
market for the copyrighted work."" Cariou v. Prince , 714 F.3d 694 , 705 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 107 ).

In assessing the purpose and character of the use, courts must determine ""whether and to what extent the new work is
transformative."" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. 510 U.S. 569 , 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) .A
transformative use is ""one that communicates something new and different from the original or expands its utility[.]"" Authors
Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 214 (2d Cir. 2015) ;see also Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust , 755 F.3d 87 , 96 (2d Cir.
2014) (""[It is] one that serves a new and different function from the original work and is not a substitute for it.""). ""[T]he critical
inquiry is whether the new work uses the copyrighted material itself for a purpose, or imbues it with a character, different
from that for which it was created."" TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168 , 180 (2d Cir. 2016) ;see also
Campbell__510 U.S. at 569 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal citations, modifications and quotation marks omitted) (the proper
inquiry is ""whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with
a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message[.]"").

Plaintiffs’ own allegations support a finding that the work is transformative. According to the complaint, as used in the Film,
the Mural's purpose was to ""locate the viewer at the Jefferson Street subway station in Bushwick."" (Compl. § 14.) And, as
argued by Plaintiffs, the Mural's use in the Film is starkly different from the expressive function of the Mural as originally
conceived to convey a message of peace. (Pls. Opp. 19; see also Id. 12-13 (indicating that the Mural's message of
""environmental justice, peace and human rights is anti-thematically relevant to the Film."") Because the use of the Mural in
the Film was transformative, the first factor weighs in favor of fair use.

Having found the use to be transformative, the other factors to be considered are of less significance. § Campbell__510 U.S.
at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (""[T]he more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like
commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.""). Nonetheless, at least one other factor weighs heavily in
Defendants’ favor—market effect. That is, courts analyze whether the infringing work functions practically as a market
substitute, such that ""potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in

[449 F.Supp.3d 94]

preference to the original."" Authors Guild v. Google , 804 F.3d at 223 . The relevant inquiry is ""whether the secondary use
usurps the market of the original work."" Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust , 755 F.3d at 96 (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 593
, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). Market usurpation is evident ""where the infringer's target audience and the nature of the infringing content
is the same as the original."" Cariou_._714 F.3d at 709 .

A fair reading of Plaintiffs' complaint allows only for the conclusion that the target audience of the Film is drastically different
from that of the Mural. The Film targets moviegoers of ""action thrillers"" with a plot ""antithetical to the message of peace that
forms the basis of both Plaintiffs’ work[.]"" (Compl. {| 15-16.) The Mural, by contrast, targets ""street art enthusiasts"" drawn to
the graffiti culture of Brooklyn. ( /d. 4 18.) The Film, according to Plaintiffs, was first viewed at a film festival and later
distributed to its audience at theaters and through streaming providers such as Netflix, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.
(Compl. ¥ 15.) The Mural's target audience, conversely, views the Mural at a destination near the entrance of the Jefferson
Street subway station in Brooklyn. LMNOPI's argument that ""[b]ackgound use in documentaries and other movies is an
important component of her licensing revenue stream,"" (Pls. Opp'n 15.), does not undermine the Court's conclusion,
because ""[t]he possibility, or even the probability or certainty, of some loss of sales does not suffice to make the copy ... [a]
substitute."" Authors Guild v. Google . 804 F.3d at 224 . Accordingly, Defendants' use was fair.

Il. FALSE ENDORSEMENT

Defendants urge dismissal of Plaintiffs’ false-endorsement claims contending that given the circumstances under which they
appear, no viewer could reasonably conclude that Plaintiffs endorsed the Film despite the inclusion of LMNOPI's tag and
Blaney's likeness. 2 (Defs.' Mot. 17.) Here again, the Court agrees.

To state a claim for false endorsement, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant ""(1) in commerce, (2) made a false or
misleading representation of fact (3) in connection with goods or services (4) that is likely to cause consumer confusion as to


--- Page 4 ---
the origin, sponsorship, or approval of the goods or services."" _Burck v. Mars, Inc. 571 F. Supp.2d 446 , 454 (S.D.N.Y.
2008). In Rogers v. Grimaldi , the Second Circuit, held that ""in general the [Lanham] Act should be construed to apply to
artistic works only where the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression.""
875 F.2d 994 , 999 (2d Cir. 1989). Admittedly, a determination of the likelihood of consumer confusion is generally a factual
issue. However, a Lanham Act claim may be dismissed, where, as here, a plaintiff fails to sufficiently plead confusion as to
source or ownership. See Cummings v. Soul Train Holdings, LLC , 67 F. Supp. 3d 599, 605 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (""Although
consumer confusion is normally a factual question, claims may be dismissed as a matter of law where the plaintiff cannot
possibly show confusion as to source or ownership.""); Louis Vuitton, 868 F. Supp. 2d at 182 (""Although many courts have
considered the Rogers test on a summary judgment motion, not on a motion to dismiss, the circuit has never stated that a
court cannot properly apply the Rogers test (or the

[449 F.Supp.3d 95]

likelihood of confusion factors) on a motion to dismiss.""). As such, ""where an expressive work is alleged to infringe a
trademark, ‘the likelihood of confusion must be particularly compelling’ "" in order for a plaintiff to successfully bring a Lanham
Act claim. Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. Warner Bros. Entm't Inc. 868 F. Supp. 2d 172 , 182 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Twin
Peaks Prods., Inc. v. Publications Int'l, Ltd. , 996 F.2d 1366 , 1379 (2d Cir. 1993) ).

As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs fail to allege a danger of consumer confusion, and instead merely assert that Defendants’
use of their marks falsely implies that Plaintiffs ""authorized the use of the [Mural]"" in the Film. (Compl. { 33.) This allegation
is insufficient to invoke the Lanham Act, which proscribes deception as to affiliation, connection, association or origin.
Cummings , 67 F. Supp. 3d at 605. Nonetheless, in Plaintiffs’ submission, they contend that Defendants ""created the false
impression in the mind of the viewer that the Plaintiffs endorsed the [Film] ... and that this false impression is harming the
good will they have developed over the years in association with their respective ‘brands.’ "" (Pls.' Opp. 18.) Even assuming
his allegation was actually pleaded, it cannot overcome Defendants' motion.

The case of Cummings is instructive here. In Cummings , the plaintiff, a former musician, alleged that the use of his image,
likeness, and voice in DVD sets and related promotional materials created the false impression that he approved of,
sponsored, or was otherwise associated with the DVD sets. 67 F. Supp. 3d at 604. The court dismissed the plaintiff's claims,
inding that he failed to sufficiently allege that the defendants’ inclusion of him in the promotional material was explicitly
misleading as to source or content of the DVD sets, especially given that the plaintiff was depicted along with many other
artists, and the defendants' trademarks appeared on the DVD sets' packaging and contents. /d. at 606. The same result is
warranted in this case.

Here, the Mural appears briefly in the Film in a scene with several other works of street art. Additionally, Plaintiffs have not
alleged a single plausible fact that the inclusion of the Mural in the Film would serve to confuse consumers that Plaintiffs

sponsored, endorsed, or were otherwise associated with the Film. Indeed, as was the case in Cummings , undercutting any
such potential allegation, the Film displays, among other things, trademarks associated with its production and distribution
companies. Because Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts sufficient to allege consumer confusion, Plaintiffs’ false
endorsement claims must fail. ®

Ill. Blaney's State Law Claim
Having dismissed all of the federal claims in this action, the Court declines to

[449 F.Supp.3d 96]

exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Blaney's state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3). See Brzak v. United
Nations , 597 F.3d 107 , 113-14 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Cave v. E. Meadow Union Free Sch. Dist. , 514 F.3d 240 , 250 (2d
Cr. 2008) ) (""We have said that if a plaintiff's federal claims are dismissed before trial, ‘the state claims should be dismissed
as well.’""); see also First Capital Mamt.. Inc. v. Satinwood, Inc. , 385 F.3d 159 , 182 (2d Cir. 2004) (""The exercise of
supplemental jurisdiction is left to the discretion of the district court[.]"").

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a claim is GRANTED.
Accordingly, Plaintiffs complaint is dismissed in its entirety.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:

1The following facts are taken from Plaintiffs' complaint and, unless otherwise indicated, are assumed to be true for purpose of the memorandum and
order.

2 Plaintiffs mistakenly refer to Defendant XYZ Films as Defendant XYZ Productions in paragraph 13 of the complaint, though Defendant XYZ Films is
properly identified at all other times in the complaint and in the case caption.

3LMNOPI incorrectly asserts that it would be premature to dismiss her copyright claim without discovery. (Pls.' Opp. 16-17.) However, ""a district court


--- Page 5 ---
may grant a motion to dismiss a copyright infringement claim if it determines that the two works are not substantially similar as a matter of law, [and it]
can properly conclude that the plaintiffs complaint, together with the works incorporated therein, do not plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.""
Perry v. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. , 765 F. App'x 470, 471-72 (2d Cir. 2019) (summary order) (quoting_Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Dev.
Corp. . 602 F.3d 57 , 63 (2d Cir. 2010) ); see also Gottlieb Dev. LLC v. Paramount Pictures Corp. . 590 F.Supp.2d 625 , 631 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (collecting
cases where courts in this circuit have dismissed copyright infringement claims where a substantial similarity between the works was lacking.).

4 See Gaito_, 602 F.3d at 64 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (""It is well settled that in ruling on [a motion to dismiss], a district court may
consider the facts as asserted within the four corners of the complaint together with the documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and any
documents incorporated in the complaint by reference. In copyright infringement actions, the works themselves supersede and control contrary
descriptions of them, any contrary allegations, conclusions or descriptions of the works contained in the pleadings."").

5Notably, the quote Plaintiffs rely on from Twentieth Century Fox , (Pls. Opp. 7), was made by the court in reference to the plaintiff's motion for a
preliminary injunction, not in addressing the defendant's motion to dismiss as the defendants in that case did not move to dismiss the plaintiff's claim
based on the defendant's alleged use of the plaintiff's video clips as Plaintiffs imply. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Marvel Enterprises, Inc. , 155 F.
Supp. 2d 1 , 22 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (""[D]efendants do not move to dismiss the copyright claim based on their alleged use of the video clips[.]""), aff in part
and remanded_, 277 F.3d 253 (2d Cir. 2002) .

& Courts in the Second Circuit have rarely ascribed significance to the nature of the work, especially when a use has already been deemed
transformative. See Hirsch , 2018 WL 6985227, at *7 (collecting cases); see also Authors Guild v. Google . 804 F.3d at 220 (""The second factor has
rarely played a significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute.""); Author's Guild v. Hathitrust 755 F.3d at 98 (""The second ... factor ... is not
dispositive."");_Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. _ 448 F.3d 605 , 612 (2d Cir. 2006) (""The second factor may be of limited usefulness where
the creative work ... is ... transformative.""). Because the Court has determined that the use of the Mural in the Film was transformative, a discussion of
the nature of the Mural is unnecessary.

Z It is not altogether clear that LMNOPI's trademark appears in the Film at all given that Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that her tag is affixed to the bottom of
the Mural, and, as noted above, the view of the bottom one-third of the Mural is obstructed.

8 Additionally, LMNOPI's false endorsement claim is dismissed as duplicative of her copyright infringement claim to which Blaney does not join. See
Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth-Century Fox Film Corp. , 539 U.S. 23 , 34, 123 S.Ct. 2041 , 156 L.Ed.2d 18 (2003) (""We have been careful to caution against
misuse or overextension of trademark ... into areas traditionally occupied by ... copyright""); Oliveira v. Frito-Lay. Inc. _ 251 F.3d 56 , 63 (2d Cir. 2001)
(""We perceive no need in the interests of fairness to ... expand the scope of trademark, because the law affords ... artists a number of other protections,
[including copyright protection]."") LMNOPI emphasizes that the inclusion of her tag indicates ""falsely ... that [she] authorized [its] use ... when [she] did
not."" (Compl. 33.) Without more, such language mimics her initial contention that her copyrighted material was used ""without [her] permission or
consent."" ( /d. ) The apparent similarity between the claims precludes LMNOPI from alleging false endorsement in the present action. See generally
Dastar Corp.__ 539 U.S. at 23 , 123 S.Ct. 2041 ;_Oliveira v. Frito-Lay, Inc. . 251 F.3d at 56 .

Appeals from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
Before FAY and KRAVITCH, Circuit Judges, and THOMPSON “, District Judge.
FAY, Circuit Judge:

This consolidated appeal presents the recurring problem of piracy of satellite television programming. Defendants-
appellants helped to create, promote, distribute and import for financial gain various pirate, computer software chips and
devices, which enabled display of plaintiffs-appellees' programming intended for their paying subscribers by disrupting the
functioning of their copyrighted computer program designed to scramble satellite transmissions. Plaintiffs-appellees brought
this action alleging violations of the copyright and communications laws. The district court granted summary judgment to
plaintiffs-appellees and awarded them statutory damages and their requested attorneys' fees. In addition to appealing these
rulings, defendants-appellants also appeal the district court's denial of their motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction
and denial of their motion for extended time to respond to the summary judgment motion. After thorough review of the
record, we affirm.

|. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A. The Programmers

Plaintiffs-appellees Home Box Office, Inc. (HBO) and Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. (Showtime) provide pay
television programming through electromagnetic signals via a communications satellite to subscription television services,
such as cable television systems, and to individual subscribers. In order to prevent individuals who have not subscribed to
their service from viewing their programming, HBO and Showtime use the VideoCipher TMII system to scramble or encrypt
the audio and video portions of their satellite transmissions. Subscribers with satellite dish antennas use the VideoCipher
TMII to decode programming for which they have paid. Upon a customer's payment of the subscription fee, the program
providers cause the subscriber's VideoCipher TMIl to descramble their programming.

The core of the VideoCipher TMIl decryption technology is a computer program, Control Microprocessor Software
(CMS), which is stored in a key integrated circuit, the U-30 chip, in the VideoCipher TMII descrambler module. Plaintiff-
appellee M/A-COM, Inc. (M/A-COM) is the owner of two versions of the CMS computer program work registered with the
United States Copyright Office under numbers TX1-952-652, dated December 18, 1986, and TX1-971-759, dated January
27, 1987. The copyright notice is affixed to the chassis of the VideoCipher TMIl descrambler or to the integrated circuit
board on which the U-30 chip is located, and a copyright notice is embedded in the CMS program itself. M/A-COM has
authorized as its licensee plaintiff-appellee Cable/Home Communication Corporation (Cable/Home), a wholly owned
subsidiary of plaintiff-appellee General Instrument Corporation. Cable/Home sells the VideoCipher TMII in Florida and
elsewhere, with annual sales generating approximately $100,000,000.00.

B. The Pirates and Their Chips

Defendant-appellant Shaun Kenny is the president, sole director and shareholder of defendant-appellant Network
Productions, Inc. (Network), a video producer. In addition to making video tapes for such uses as corporate seminars and
legal depositions, Network produces a weekly news program, known as Boresight News (Boresight).

Page 835


--- Page 2 ---
This program, transmitted by satellite to the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean Islands presents industry
news to satellite dish dealers, distributors and private owners. Producer Kenny has marketed Boresight as a consumer-
oriented news program and has utilized the show to comment upon and to criticize the practices and products of
programmers.

Following the advent of scrambling signals by programmers, Kenny decided that scrambled programming was not
being offered to home satellite dish owners at a reasonable price competitive with those offered to cable television
subscribers. He commenced an informative consumer campaign, which included discussion on Boresight as well as sales of
devices designed to break or defeat the programmers' methods of scrambling signals. His alleged purposes in providing
such information have been to instigate legislation protecting competition in the marketplace by insuring programming to
consumers at a fair price and to show viewers that the VideoCipher TMIl is compromised easily and, therefore, is a poor
investment.

Integrated circuit chips, designed to replace the U-30 chip in the VideoCipher TMII and to alter the functioning of the
VideoCipher TMIl enabling a user to descramble encrypted pay television programming, are generally and collectively
referred to as pirate chips. Two methods have been employed to utilize pirate chips: the ""Three Musketeers"" technique,
whereby subscription to a single programming service, usually the least expensive, is used to access all other programming
services without further payment or authorization, and ""cloning,"" whereby multiple units are altered and linked so that any
one unit subscribing to pay programming acts as the conduit for receipt of such services by all the units without additional
payment or authorization. ' Kenny has testified that ""[u]sing a pirate chip is totally illegal if you're receiving programming
you're not paying for."" With knowledge of the potential legal consequences, Kenny pursued his publicity and sale of pirate
chips.

Kenny had another business known as Bag-O-Parts, which sold a kit used to decode the VideoCipher TMII by allowing
users to unscramble video portions of scrambled transmissions to which they did not subscribe. During 1986, Bag-O-Parts
not only was Kenny's sole source of income, but also supported Boresight for a time. Kenny profited $17,000.00 from sales
of Bag-O-Parts.

Kenny advertised and promoted his Bag-O-Parts business on Boresight as well as the Dealer Demo chip, which also
unscrambled the video transmissions of the VideoCipher TMI. This device, designed for dealers' showroom display,
simultaneously overlays the middle of the screen with a solid black box, which allows insertion of a message. The Dealer
Demo chip is an 86% copy of the CMS program of VideoCipher TMI and contains a copy of the M/A-COM copyright notice.

Kenny also publicized on Boresight a small plastic socket for insertion into the slot containing the U-30 chip to allow
easy removal and insertion of the U-30 chip. Additionally, the socket ""facilitates the --- the person to install a pirate chip"" in
place of the U-30 chip. 3 Because the process of inserting the socket into the VideoCipher TMIl involved soldering, a
procedure some individuals are unqualified to perform, Kenny offered the service of removing the U-30 chip and installing
the socket for customers who sent their VideoCipher TMI circuitry boards to him for the procedure. Kenny advertised this
service for $39.00 per unit, payable to cash. He

Page 836

boasted that this was another ""way for Shaun to make money during all this,"" and even offered to remove the pirate chip and
socket and to replace the U-30 chip if customers ever had to return their circuitry boards to M/A-COM because Kenny was
""sneaky."" 4

While these descrambling methods for video reception were profitable, Kenny recognized that the ability to unscramble
both audio and video would be more valuable. 5 Kenny and former defendant Bob Cooper, Jr., a commentator on Boresight
and publisher of Coop Satellite Digest, a publication similar in information and commentary to Boresight, became interested
in a method to ""break the VCII."" © In approximately May, 1986, Kenny learned of the formation of DESUG (Data Encryption
Standard Users Group), a group composed of individuals committed to breaking the VideoCipher TMII as an academic
exercise. Through Boresight, Kenny collected funds and equipment for DESUG to enable the group to conduct their
research. Kenny sent $1,250.00 to DESUG member and former defendant Stephen Bepko, who purchased a VideoCipher
TMII and devised pirate chips for compromising M/A-COM's VideoCipher TMIl. Bepko developed the Rabbit Writer and the
Rabbit Video chips, respectively 94% and 98% copies of the CMS program within the U-30 chip, and used as his marketing
name, Rabbit Trading Company.

DESUG member and former defendant William Ward requested money from Kenny for a computer and burner in order
to make pirate chips to compromise the VideoCipher TMII system. Kenny ultimately sent Ward $900.00 with which Ward
made a Three Musketeers chip, a 93% copy of the CMS program of the U-30 chip, to compromise the VideoCipher TMI.
Ward marketed this chip under the name Comtech, Ltd. When Kenny learned that Ward intended to reduce the price on his
pirate chip, Kenny informed Ward that he could not advertise his product on Boresight. Ward inferred that Kenny would
denigrate his pirate chip on Boresight and interpreted Kenny's admonition as a definite ""commercial threat."" 7

In addition to publicizing and financially assisting the production of pirate chips on Boresight, Kenny also demonstrated
the use of pirate chips on the show. On the December 4, 1986 show, for example, Kenny, Cooper and former defendant
Karen Howes, a reporter and journalist on Boresight, discussed and demonstrated three pirate chips, two of the Three
Musketeers type and one clone, which enabled the user also to receive the audio transmission on the VideoCipher TMI. ®
Kenny actually demonstrated with a VideoCipher TMII the ""minor surgery"" necessary for inserting a pirate chip and advised


--- Page 3 ---
his audience to tape that segment of Boresight for future use. 9 Kenny announced on Boresight the availability
Page 837
of pirate chips to break the VideoCipher TMII and acknowledged the profit in these chips:

Well are you ready? Is the industry ready? Is [sic] M/A-COM ready? Is cable ready? Is programmers ready? Are they all
ready? And most, most importantly is the Motion Picture Association ready for this? Because what this is ... is a broken VC-
Il, and no longer is it a requirement for you to pay for services that you feel are over-priced. Unfortunately, you're still gonna
have to pay the $400 for the decoder and you're gonna make some people rich by paying $250 to $400 for a system that
breaks the VC-II, but that's the price you gotta pay if you want to cheat in the world.

Boresight News Transcript at 9-10 (Dec. 4, 1986). R3-80-Ex.D-9-10.

Kenny ultimately publicized and endorsed on Boresight two Three Musketeers chips, X-ACT and Integrated Digital
Systems or IDS, manufactured by separate Canadian companies. On Boresight, Cooper warned the audience that pirate
chips should be purchased from companies outside the United States ""[b]ecause it's plainly illegal to be dealing in this sort of
device from within the United States."" 1° Viewers of Boresight were informed repeatedly of the illegality of pirate chips. ""!
With concern over impending lawsuits, Kenny used Boresight to request contributions from viewers for a legal defense fund.
12 Therefore, not only were Kenny and the other former defendants aware of the unlawful sale and use of pirate chips, but
also the Boresight audience, potential purchasers and users of pirate chips, were so informed.

C. The Descrambling Summit

Kenny used Boresight to promote attendance at a Descrambling Summit, held in three successive sessions from
January 14 through 22, 1987, on the Islands of Providenciales, Turks and Caicos in the British West Indies. Cooper, who
maintained an office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, organized the summit. The purpose of the summit was to educate those
attending on the descrambling system, including how the VideoCipher TMII had been broken, and the availability of various
pirate chips. Each of the three hundred attendees paid a fee of $1,500.00, which included round-trip air fare from Fort
Lauderdale to the island of Providenciales through a Fort Lauderdale travel agency, all accommodations, and four
descrambling or pirate chips with an advertised street value of $1,400.00. Additionally, Boresight viewers were informed that
they would be instructed at the summit on treating the descrambler business as a ""profit center"" or ""how to make money with
the chips."" 8 Cooper paid Kenny $14,500.00 to videotape the entire summit.

Page 838
The videotapes were to be sold for $195.00 each, and Kenny and Cooper planned to divide the profits.

On the first day of the summit, Cooper explained to the attendees that the summit was being held outside the United
States in order to avoid prohibitive American laws. ‘4 Interestingly, a portion of the summit program was devoted to
education in American copyright and communications laws by a Canadian attorney. He instructed that, under American
statutory and case law, anyone manufacturing, distributing, selling or installing equipment enabling a party to intercept
encoded transmissions could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. He advised that ""it will be very difficult to obtain any
financial gain through exploitation of this technology without risking some potentially serious consequences."" 15

Regarding American copyright laws, the attorney explained that the basis for a copyright violation in descrambling
encoded transmissions is the unauthorized use of the programming for which the programmer holds the copyright. He
further reported that ""[t]hose who claim to have extracted the software from the memory chips inside of VideoCipher TM
acknowledge finding copyright notices contained in the data."" '® He advised the summit attendees that breaking the
VideoCipher TMIl and watching a copyrighted program without paying for it violated the programmer's copyright.

Furthermore, Cooper informed the summit audience of a lawsuit filed January 7, 1987, in federal district court in
Arizona by plaintiffs-appellees Cable/Home, M/A-COM and HBO against individuals and their respective companies through
which they did business for unauthorized descrambling of VideoCipher TMIl transmissions. '” He advised that the suit
sought to prevent the defendants from manufacturing or selling decoding devices, to recover the defendants' profits from
their unlawful sales and to award the plaintiffs monetary damages for the alleged violations of the copyright and
communications laws. He also told the attendees that a spokesman for Cable/Home had admonished that the Arizona civil
suit was the first action in a concerted effort by Cable/Home to stop piracy in satellite television.

Despite the legal instruction given at the Descrambling Summit and the knowledge of a lawsuit filed for the use of
decoding devices, the attendees received their promised pirate chips on the last day of the summit. They were given the
option of taking the pirate chips with them or having the pirate chips mailed to them in the United States. Cooper instructed
those electing to take their pirate chips with them on completion of their customs declaration, and told them that the pirate
chips had not been purchased. He assured these individuals that, if their pirate chips were confiscated, then he would
replace them. The United States Customs Service seized pirate chips in the possession of those who had attended the
second session of the Descrambling Summit and returned to the United States on January 19, 1987.

D. Prior Procedure

Upon learning of the Descrambling Summit, where pirate chips were distributed


--- Page 4 ---
Page 839

and sold, plaintiffs filed their original complaint in the Southern District of Florida, seeking, among other requests, a
preliminary and permanent injunction, statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. 18 Defendants filed motions to dismiss
on several grounds, including lack of personal jurisdiction over them in Florida. The district court denied these motions to
dismiss in an omnibus order.

On June 17, 1987, the district court entered a preliminary injunction generally enjoining defendants from manufacturing,
installing, marketing, using, importing, and distributing any device capable of assisting in the unauthorized interception of
transmission signals carrying pay programming by compromising the copyrighted CMS program within the U-30 chip.
Furthermore, defendants were prevented from destroying or concealing any records regarding transactions and profits
resulting from defendants' involvement with such intercepting devices. 19 Despite the preliminary injunction, Kenny continued
to promote pirate chips to his viewing audiences, including availability from a Mexican company.

In answering the second amended and controlling complaint, basing jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. sections 1331 and 1338,
defendants asserted the affirmative defense of First Amendment protection for information regarding pirate chips that they
had disseminated. Alleging defendants’ willful violation of the copyright and communications laws, plaintiffs moved for
summary judgment. The district court granted plaintiffs' unopposed motion for summary judgment by default against
defendants, and denied the motion for extension of time to respond to plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion by defendants
Kenny and Network because of their repeated failure to comply with the terms of the court and the local rules. 2° Defendant
Cooper did not oppose entry of summary judgment against him.

Defendants Network and Kenny moved to vacate or amend the judgment entered against them pursuant to Rule 59(e)
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Admittedly, their motion was made outside of ten days after entry of judgment as
required by Rule 59(e). Defendants, however, explained that they recently had acquired new counsel, who had not had
sufficient time to oppose plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion. The district court entered an order giving defendants’ new
counsel ten days, with no extensions, to respond to plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion on the merits. Nevertheless,
defendants’ new counsel moved for an additional ten days to respond to plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion. The district
court denied this motion for a second extension of response time.

Defendants Network and Kenny filed their opposition to plaintiffs' summary judgment motion within the first extension of
time granted to them by the district court. Among their grounds for opposition, defendants claimed that they were

Page 840

protected by the First Amendment and their warnings of illegality. Upon consideration of defendants’ opposition, the district
court denied defendants’ motion to vacate or amend its previous entry of summary judgment.

Following the district court's confirmation of summary judgment for plaintiffs, they applied for joint and several
assessment of attorneys' fees and costs. Since they had elected statutory damages because of their inability to obtain profit
information from defendants, plaintiffs also moved for reconsideration of trying the issues of damages and attorneys' fees.
Because statutory damages, attorneys' fees and the scope of the permanent injunction, the remaining issues in the case,
were committed by statute to the district court's discretion, plaintiffs contended that a trial was not warranted.

The district court held a status conference on all pending motions, wherein plaintiffs requested maximum statutory
damages. On June 27, 1988, the district court issued final judgment and a permanent injunction, which reiterated the original
preliminary injunction. The court also vacated its order setting trial, and awarded plaintiffs joint and several statutory
damages with interest against defendants Network, Kenny and Cooper in the amount of $20,000.00 for their willful, direct
and contributory copyright infringements and their for-profit violations of the communications laws, with additional damages
and interest against Network and Kenny for separate willful, for-profit violations of the communications laws. Referring
plaintiffs’ request for attorneys' fees and costs to the magistrate for determination, the district court retained jurisdiction over
these issues pending resolution.

Following a hearing, including expert testimony, review of the record, and weighing precedential guidelines for
awarding attorneys’ fees, the magistrate recommended granting plaintiffs' requested attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount
of $451,789.06. 2! The magistrate acknowledged that plaintiffs' successful litigation strategy was for the purpose of
protecting their copyrighted asset. They sought not only to enjoin the conduct of these defendants, but also to deter others
in future attempts to compromise the VideoCipher TMIl for profit. After reviewing the magistrate's order as well as responses
thereto by defendants and plaintiffs, the district court's final judgment affirmed and adopted the magistrate's report and
recommendation of attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $451,789.06. 22

Page 841

From these proceedings, defendants-appellants Network and Kenny have appealed five issues to this court. First, they
contend that the district court erred in entering summary judgment against them. Second, defendants-appellants argue that
they were entitled to a jury or bench trial regarding damages. Third, they claim that the district court abused its discretion by
awarding excessive attorneys’ fees to plaintiffs. Fourth, they fault the district court for denying their motion to dismiss on the
ground that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants in Florida. Fifth, Network and Kenny assert that the
district court abused its discretion in denying defendants' motion for additional time within which to respond to the motion for
summary judgment. We will address these appellate issues seriatim.

Il. ANALYSIS
A. The Grant of Summary Judgment to Plaintiffs

Summary judgment is appropriate ""if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The Supreme Court has specified procedural and substantive
standards for deciding when summary judgment is proper. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett. 477 U.S. 317 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91
L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) ; Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.. 477 U.S. 242 , 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) . The movant
""pears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion"" by identifying those portions of the
record that demonstrate the absence of genuine issues of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323 , 106 S.Ct. at 2553 . When
a motion for summary judgment has been made properly, the burden of production shifts to the nonmoving party ""to go
beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,’
designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'"""" Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 , 106 S.Ct. at 2553
(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c, e)).

Anderson explains how the district court should evaluate the evidence submitted with a summary judgment motion.
Analogizing a summary judgment decision with directed verdict analysis, the Court defined a factual dispute as genuine ""if
the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party."" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248 , 106
S.Ct. at 2510 ; see Everett v. Napper, 833 F.2d 1507 , 1510 (11th Cir.1987); Dominick v. Dixie Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 809 F.2d
1559 , 1572 (11th Cir.1987). Clarifying the definition of a genuine factual dispute preventing summary judgment under Rule
56(c), the Court explained: ""By its very terms, this standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute
between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that
there be no genuine issue of material fact."" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48 , 106 S.Ct. at 2510 (emphasis in original).
Furthermore, the Court instructed that ""the substantive law will identify which facts are material"" and that the trial judge
""must view the evidence presented through the prism of the substantive evidentiary burden"" in ruling on a summary
judgment motion. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248 , 254, 106 S.Ct. at 2510 , 2513.

Appellate review of a grant of summary judgment is plenary, and we must apply the same legal standards used by the
district court. Livernois v. Medical Disposables, Inc., 837 F.2d 1018 , 1021-22 (11th Cir.1988); Carlin Communication, Inc. v.
Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 802 F.2d 1352 , 1356 (11th Cir.1986). This court has reviewed thoroughly the ample record in
the case, and we have found that the undisputed, operative facts concerning the open promotion and sale of pirate chips by
defendants for financial gain, even when viewed most favorably as to defendants, as well as reasonable inferences drawn
therefrom do not create a genuine issue of material fact warranting trial. See Augusta Iron & Steel Works, Inc. v. Employers

Ins. of Wausau, 835 F.2d 855 , 856 (11th Cir.1988) (per curiam); Carlin Communication, 802 F.2d at 1356 ; Warrior
Tombigbee Transp. Co. v. M/V Nan Fung, 695 F.2d 1294 , 1296-97 (11th Cir.1983). Therefore, the copyright and
communications claims must be analyzed under the controlling substantive law in order to determine if the district court's
decision was correct as a matter of law. Everett, 833 F.2d at 1510 ; see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

1. Copyright Violations

The Copyright Act of 1976 (Copyright Act), 17 U.S.C. Secs. 101 et seq., is the congressional implementation of an
affirmative constitutional duty under the copyright and patent clause ""[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,
by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."" U.S.
Const. art. |, Sec. 8, cl. 8; Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Scoreboard Posters. Inc., 600 F.2d 1184 , 1187 (5th
Cir.1979); 23 see Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 428-29, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 782, 78 L.Ed.2d 574
(1984) ; Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201 , 219, 74 S.Ct. 460 , 471, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954) ; Washingtonian Publishing Co. v.
Pearson, 306 U.S. 30 , 36,59 S.Ct. 397 , 400, 83 L.Ed. 470 (1939) . The Copyright Act provides a fair return to authors and
inventors by protecting their works from exploitation by others. 24 See Harper & Row, Publishers. Inc. v. Nation Enterprises
471 U.S. 539 , 546, 105 S.Ct. 2218 2223, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) ; Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151,
156, 95 S.Ct. 2040 , 2043-44, 45 L.Ed.2d 84 (1975) . The district court issued its final judgment and permanent injunction
based on defendants’ willful, direct and contributory copyright infringements. Accordingly, we must examine the substantive
law of direct and contributory copyright infringement in order to determine if defendants’ acts violated plaintiffs' copyrighted
CMS computer program, stored in the U-30 chip.

a. Direct Copyright Infringement

The Copyright Act extends protection to computer programs. 17 U.S.C. Secs. 101 & 102(a) (1982) 25 ; Apple Computer.
Inc. v. Formula Int'l Inc., 725 F.2d 521 , 524 (9th Cir.1984); Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Artic Int'l, Inc., 685 F.2d 870 , 875
(3d Cir.1982). The seminal case of Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99 , 25 L.Ed. 841 (1879) , requires federal courts to
distinguish between unprotected ideas and protected expression, a concept which has been incorporated in the Copyright
Act. 2° See Harper

Page 843

& Row, 471 U.S. at 556 , 105 S.Ct. at 2228 ; Miller v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 650 F.2d 1365 , 1368 (5th Cir. July 1981);
see also Mazer, 347 U.S. at 217 , 74 S.Ct. at 470 (""Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed;



--- Page 6 ---
protection is given only to the expression of the idea--not the idea itself."" (citation omitted)). Courts have struggled with this
dichotomy in the context of computer programs, given the various types and functions of these programs. See, e.g., Whelan
Assocs., Inc. v. Jaslow Dental Laboratory, Inc., 797 F.2d 1222 , 1236-40 (3d Cir.1986), cert. denied,479 U.S. 1031 , 107
S.Ct. 877 , 93 L.Ed.2d 831 (1987) ; Formula, 725 F.2d at 523-25 ; Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.. 714
F.2d 1240 , 1252-54 (3d Cir.1983), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 1033 , 104 S.Ct. 690 , 79 L.Ed.2d 158 (1984) . We find
persuasive and applicable in this case the reasoning of the Third Circuit in Franklin, analyzing not only the copyrightability of
a program embedded on a ROM (Read Only Memory) or semi-conductor chip inserted into the circuitry of a computer, but
also the copyright protection for a program communicating with the operating system of a computer as opposed to the user.
27 Franklin, 714 F.2d at 1249-54 ; see also Formula, 725 F.2d at 525 (""The computer program when written embodies
expression; never has the Copyright Act required that the expression be communicated to a particular audience."");
Tennessee Fabricating Co. v. Moultrie Mfg. Co., 421 F.2d 279 , 281 (5th Cir.) (""[LJack of artistic merit is no bar to
copyright.""), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 928 , 90 S.Ct. 1819 , 26 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970) .

Defendants-appellants' direct copyright infringement relates to the use, demonstration, promotion, and sale by Kenny
through Network of the Dealer Demo chip, an 86% copy of the CMS program within the U-30 chip of the VideoCipher TMII.
28 Public distribution of a copyrighted work is a right reserved to the copyright owner, and usurpation of that right constitutes
infringement. 17 U.S.C. Sec. 106(3); 2 Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 8.11[A] (1988). Because Kenny demonstrated and
promoted the Dealer Demo chip on Boresight, there is irrefutable evidence of direct copyright infringement in this case.

Defendants-appellants have claimed that their affirmative defense of fair use precludes a finding of copyright
infringement. ""Fair use"" describes ""limited and useful forms of copying and distribution that are tolerated as exceptions to
copyright protection."" Pacific & Southern Co. v. Duncan, 744 F.2d 1490 , 1494 (11th Cir.1984), cert. denied,471 U.S. 1004 ,
105 S.Ct. 1867 , 85 L.Ed.2d 161 (1985) ; see also Tennessee Fabricating, 421 F.2d at 284 (""[T]o constitute ‘fair use’ the
permitted use must be for some legitimate, fair and reasonable purpose."").

Page 844

The Copyright Act mandates four nonexclusive factors which courts shall consider case by case in determining fair use, a
mixed question of fact and law:

[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies ... for purposes such as criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an
infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be
considered shall include--

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. Sec. 107 (1982); Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 549 , 560-61, 105 S.Ct. at 2225 , 2230-31; Duncan, 744 F.2d at
1494-95 & n. 8. With respect to the first factor, the Supreme Court has clarified that ""a commercial or profit-making purpose""
is presumptively unfair. Sony, 464 U.S. at 448-49 , 104 S.Ct. at 792 ; Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. at 2231 ;
Duncan, 744 F.2d at 1496 . Implicit in this presumption is some meaningful likelihood that future market harm exists. Sony,
464 U.S. at 451 , 104 S.Ct. at 793 . ""The crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is
monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the
customary price."" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. at 2231 . Not only did Kenny have a commercial purpose,
evidenced by his own statements on Boresight, but also he utilized the show to encourage others to make a profit by selling
pirate chips, complete with demonstrations of how to descramble programming on the VideoCipher TMII using pirate chips.
Kenny's flagrant commercial purpose whereby he exploited the subject CMS computer program cannot be disguised as fair
use.

The second factor that we must consider is the nature of the copyrighted work. This factor is ""highly relevant to whether
a given use is fair."" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 552-53 , 105 S.Ct. at 2226 . In this case, the copyrighted computer program
embedded in the U-30 chip descrambles satellite-transmitted programming for paying subscribers. The subject computer
program secures plaintiffs-appellees' product, audio-visual programming, for these subscribers, and it has copyright
protection. Because the CMS computer program is copyrighted, a pirate chip copying this program and performing its
function violates the copyright laws. Any decoding pirate chip is unlawful, not fair use. See also Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at
564 , 105 S.Ct. at 2232 (""A use that so clearly infringes the copyright holder's interests in confidentiality ... is difficult to
characterize as ‘fair.'""); Duncan, 744 F.2d at 1497 (Even the societal importance of receipt of news did not save the copying
and sale of a television station's news reports as fair use.).

Regarding the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion of the copyrighted work used, the Supreme
Court has directed a qualitative evaluation of the copying of the copyrighted work. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564-65 , 105
S.Ct. at 2233 . That is, a small degree of taking is sufficient to transgress fair use if the copying is the essential part of the
copyrighted work. See, e.g., Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 539 , 565-66, 105 S.Ct. at 2233 (13% of defendant's article copied


--- Page 7 ---
from plaintiff's manuscript held sufficient for copyright infringement because it contained the heart of the book); Meeropol v.
Nizer, 560 F.2d 1061 , 1071 (2d Cir.1977) (although copyrighted letters were less than 1% of the infringing work, they were
displayed prominently), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1013 , 98 S.Ct. 727 , 54 L.Ed.2d 756 (1978) ; Roy Export Co. Establishment
of Vaduz, Liechtenstein, Black. Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys.. Inc., 503 F.Supp. 1137 , 1145 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (fifty-

Page 845

five seconds taken from a one-hour and twenty-nine-minute film deemed qualitatively substantial for copyright infringement),
aff'd, 672 F.2d 1095 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 826 , 103 S.Ct. 60 , 74 L.Ed.2d 63 (1982) ; see also Sheldon v. Metro-
Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 81 F.2d 49 , 56 (2d Cir.) (""[NJo plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his work
he did not pirate.""), cert. denied, 298 U.S. 669 , 56 S.Ct. 835 , 80 L.Ed. 1392 (1936) . Furthermore, copying a substantial
portion of the copyrighted work evidences the qualitative value of the copied work, both to the copyright owner and to the
infringer ""who seeks to profit from marketing someone else's copyrighted expression."" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 565 , 105
S.Ct. at 2233 ; see also Southern Bell, 756 F.2d at 810 (Substantial copying raises the issue of fair use.). The Dealer Demo
chip, used and promoted by Kenny on Boresight, copies 86% of the CMS computer program within the U-30 chip. Because
virtually all of the copyrighted work is used, evidenced by the essential or majority of the video picture being displayed, the
fair-use defense is unavailing. See id.

The fourth factor, the effect on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, is considered by the Supreme
Court as ""undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use,"" since a proper application of fair use does not impair
materially the marketability of the copied work. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566-67 , 105 S.Ct. at 2233-34 (citing 1 Nimmer on
Copyright Sec. 1.10[D]. Under section 107, ""potential market"" means either an immediate or a delayed market, and includes
harm to derivative works. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 568 , 105 S.Ct. at 2234 ; Duncan, 744 F.2d at 1496 . Plaintiffs-
appellants' business consists of selling programming to paying subscribers, and the subject, copyrighted CMS computer
program secures their product for customers. Obviously, receipt of plaintiffs-appellees' scrambled programming without
payment injures their present and future customer markets, and denies them considerable revenue to which they are
entitled for the services that they provide. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 567 , 105 S.Ct. at 2234 .

Moreover, ""every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation"" of the copyright
owner's monopoly privilege. Sony, 464 U.S. at 451 , 104 S.Ct. at 793 ; Duncan, 744 F.2d at 1496-97 . On Boresight, Kenny
openly touted the inroads that had been and could be made into the VideoCipher TMII market as well as the profitability of
pirate chips. The actual and future detrimental market effects coupled with the commercial-use presumption negates the fair-
use defense. We, therefore, conclude that plaintiffs-appellees' unrefuted prima facie case of willful, direct copyright
infringement merited summary judgment because none of the four statutory factors supported defendants-appellants'
affirmative defense of fair use.

b. Contributory Copyright Infringement

Contributory infringement necessarily must follow a finding of direct or primary infringement. 3 Nimmer on Copyright
Sec. 12.04[A] at 12-42 to -42.1. This court has stated the well-settled test for a contributory infringer as "" ‘one who, with
knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another.’ "" Casella
v. Morris, 820 F.2d 362 , 365 (11th Cir.1987) (quoting Gershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management, Inc., 443
F.2d 1159 , 1162 (2d Cir.1971)); Columbia Pictures Indus.. Inc. v. Redd Horne, Inc., 749 F.2d 154 , 160 (3d Cir.1984); see
also Sony, 464 U.S. at 437 , 104 S.Ct. at 786 (The Supreme Court has defined a contributory infringer as one who ""was in a
position to control the use of copyrighted works by others and had authorized the use without permission from the copyright
owner.""); 3 Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 12.04 (generally discussing contributory infringement). Furthermore, this court
explicated that ""[t]he standard of knowledge is objective: 'Know, or have reason to know.’ "" 2° Casella,

Page 846

20 F.2d at 365 (quoting Gershwin, 443 F.2d at 1162 ). Contributory infringement will not be found if the product in question is
capable of ""substantial noninfringing uses,"" the determinative issue in Sony, and clarified in that case as wide use ""for
legitimate, unobjectionable purposes."" Sony, 464 U.S. at 442 , 104 S.Ct. at 789 ; see 3 Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 12.04[A]
at 12-42 to -45. In Sony, the Court was impressed by the district court's finding that the petitioner, Sony Corporation, had not
""influenced or encouraged"" unlawful copies. Sony, 464 U.S. at 438 , 104 S.Ct. at 787 .

The facts in this case demonstrate that Kenny actually knew that the CMS computer program was copyrighted, and that
he acted in direct defiance of this knowledge. Kenny encouraged the duplication of the CMS program of the U-30 chip by
giving funds and equipment to Bepko and Ward in order to break the VideoCipher TMI. In his descriptions of pirate chips on
Boresight, he frequently warned that these chips were unlawful. Furthermore, Kenny recommended the purchase of pirate
chips abroad in order to avoid American laws.

Even if he could prove that he did not know that the subject computer program was copyrighted, actual knowledge is
not required. All that must be shown is that Kenny had reason to know. Casella, 820 F.2d at 365 . At the Descrambling
Summit, Cooper discussed the recent copyright infringement suit in Arizona, involving some of the plaintiffs-appellees in this
case as well as a defendant from which Kenny had acquired a pirate chip. Additionally, an attorney there, as part of the
instructive program, specifically addressed the inherent legal problems of pirate chips and advised that the use of pirate
chips to break the VideoCipher TMIl would violate American copyright and communications laws. The Descrambling Summit
was held outside the United States in order to avoid American laws, and attendees were informed that their distributed
pirate chips could be mailed to them to evade the United States Customs Service.


--- Page 8 ---
There is ample, undisputed evidence in this case to show that defendants-appellants had actual or apparent knowledge
that the CMS computer program located in the U-30 chip was copyrighted and that they were violating the copyright laws by
promoting and selling pirate chips designed to break the VideoCipher TMII. Furthermore, we find particularly reprehensible
Kenny's continuing to hawk pirate chips to his audiences not only after suit was filed in this case, but also following entry of
the preliminary injunction. We are not persuaded by defendants-appellants' arguments of noninfringing uses. °° While there
may be other uses for some of the devices promoted by Kenny, we conclude that Kenny utilized and advertised these
devices primarily as infringement aids and not for legitimate, noninfringing uses. An ostensible

Page 847

purpose of Boresight was to inform its audience of the latest developments in the pirate chip business and to instruct
viewers in methods to compromise the VideoCipher TMIl by using pirate chips. Kenny even offered to install the socket in
circuitry boards to facilitate the insertion of a pirate chip to replace the U-30 chip. Accordingly, we conclude that Kenny's use
of Boresight to promote various pirate chips as well as other infringing aids, and his participation in the Descrambling
Summit constituted obtrusive contributory infringement, warranting granting summary judgment. 3

2. Communications Violations

The district court found defendants-appellants Kenny and Network liable for willful, for-profit violations of section 705 of
the Federal Communications Act of 1934 (Communications Act), as amended, 47 U.S.C. section 605 (Supp. V 1987). 32
Section 605(a) prohibits the unauthorized receipt, assistance in receiving, or further transmission of radio communications
for benefit by a person (individual, partnership, association, joint-stock company, trust or corporation) or that of another
unentitled individual or entity. °° 47 U.S.C. Sec. 153(i) (1982); 47 U.S.C. Sec. 605(a) (Supp. V 1987). ""Radio
communication,"" as defined by section 3(b) of the Communications Act, has been interpreted to include television
transmissions. 47 U.S.C. Sec. 153(b) (1982); ON/ TV of Chicago v. Julien, 763 F.2d 839, 842 (7th Cir.1985). The act of
viewing subscription programming on a television set equipped with an unauthorized decoder has been held to be disclosure
of the "" 'existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning’ "" of the signal of the subscription television service to
nonsubscribers. National Subscription Television v. S & H TV, 644 F.2d 820 , 827 (9th Cir.1981) (quoting 47 U.S.C. Sec.
605(a)). Under section 605(d)(4), the importation, manufacture, sale, or distribution of equipment intended to be used to
assist in any intercepting and/or divulging activity proscribed by section 605(a) creates liability to the same penalties and
remedies as the person or entity engaging in such prohibited activities. 54

Page 848

The prohibitions of section 605, however, ""shall not apply to the receiving, divulging, publishing, or utilizing the contents
of any radio communication which is transmitted by any station for the use of the general public..."" 47 U.S.C. Sec. 605(a)
(Supp. V 1987). Confronted with decoding or descrambling devices in the context of subscription television, other circuits
have construed communication transmissions for the use of the general public to mean intended for, rather than available
to, the general public in order to find unauthorized decoders violative of section 605. See, e.g., ON/TV, 763 F.2d at 842 ;
Movie Sys., Inc. v. Heller, 710 F.2d 492 , 494 (8th Cir.1983); National Subscription Television, 644 F.2d at 823-25 ;
Chartwell Communications Group v. Westbrook, 637 F.2d 459 , 465 (6th Cir.1980). We are persuaded by the rationale of
the Seventh Circuit, affirming the grant of injunctive relief against the seller of decoder kits to unscramble plaintiff's
subscription television signal:

ON/TV collects its revenues by renting decoders to its subscribers. Typically, viewers who purchase pirate decoders do so to
evade paying the monthly rental fee to ON/TV. Thus, ON/TV loses a potential customer whenever a pirate decoder is sold.
The sale of pirate decoders threatens the viability of the subscription television industry and there is no countervailing social
or policy consideration that would justify these sales.

ON/TV, 763 F.2d at 844 .

This circuit has addressed unauthorized viewing of certain satellite transmissions, including Showtime, by using an
earth satellite dish owned in common by individual unit owners of a condominium association. Showtime/_The Movie
Channel, Inc. v. Covered Bridge Condominium Ass'n, Inc., 881 F.2d 983 (11th Cir.1989) (per curiam). 35 This court held that
section 605(a) ""prohibits the unauthorized third party reception of satellite transmissions intended for fee-paying
subscribers."" Id. at 988. Combining the statutory language, the interpretive reasoning of other circuits specifically addressing
unauthorized decoding or descrambling devices for subscription television, and the decision by this court, we hold that
section 605 readily applies to proscribe pirate chips and other unauthorized decoding devices, which enable third parties to
receive television satellite transmissions intended for paying subscribers. National Subscription Television, 644 F.2d at 826 ;
see also Chartwell Communications, 637 F.2d at 466 (""It is clear that by selling decoders or decoder schematics the
appellees are assisting third parties in receiving communications to which they are not entitled."").

Defendants-appellants have argued that sales of Dealer Demo chips and Bag-O-Parts kits do not violate section 605
because these devices descramble only the video portion of the satellite transmission and because the Dealer Demo chip
overlays a portion of the video picture with a black box. These assertions, however, ignore the plain meaning of the statutory
language, which defines ""encrypt"" as modifying aural, visual, or both transmissions to prevent unauthorized programming
receipt. 9° See National Subscription Television, 644 F.2d at 826-27 . We conclude that defendants-appellants

Page 849


--- Page 9 ---
have not refuted their obvious violations of section 605.

Kenny's words and demonstrations on Boresight encouraged and assisted third parties in their purchase and use of
decoding devices to compromise the VideoCipher TMII. Furthermore, he directly assisted Bepko and Ward with funds and
equipment to aid them in the manufacture of pirate chips for the intended sale to and use by third parties. Kenny and those
manufacturers of chips, whom he assisted, unquestionably profited from their activities. Kenny even bragged on Boresight
that his charge for installing a socket in a circuitry board for easy removal of the U-30 chip was another way for him to make
money. He also informed his audiences of the names and addresses of sources of pirate chips outside the United States.
With such overwhelming, undisputed evidence, including Kenny's words and actions, we conclude that the district court
correctly granted summary judgment as to defendants-appellants' willful and profitable communications violations of section
605. See Covered Bridge, 881 F.2d at 989 .

3. The First Amendment Defense

From the outset of this litigation and their assertion of a First Amendment affirmative defense regarding both the
copyright and communications violations, defendants-appellants have claimed that Kenny's discussions on Boresight of the
encryption technology, the existence and availability of pirate chips, and the Descrambling Summit amount to nothing more
than informational reporting and editorial commentary, or protected speech. In their effort to support their defense of the
public's right to a free exchange of information and ideas, Kenny and Network have argued that their speech did not lose its
protected character because some individuals may have listened to it, chosen to attend the summit, obtained pirate chips,
and used them ""to commit some illegal act."" Appellants’ Brief at 43. Furthermore, they assert that Kenny warned his
audiences that the various decoding devices might be unlawful. Defendants-appellants protest that the final judgment and
permanent injunction in this case constitute an unconstitutional application of statutory law to abridge their right to free
speech.

With respect to copyright protection, ""[t]he first amendment is not a license to trammel on legally recognized rights in
intellectual property."" Dallas Cowboys, 600 F.2d at 1188 . Since the Copyright Act is the congressional implementation of a
constitutional directive to encourage inventors by protecting their exclusive rights in their discoveries, copyright interests also
must be guarded under the Constitution, and injunctive relief is a common judicial response to infringement of a valid
copyright. U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 8; Dallas Cowboys, 600 F.2d at 1187 ; see also Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 555-60 ,
105 S.Ct. at 2228-30 ; Duncan, 744 F.2d at 1498-99 (discussing generally a refusal to revisit fair-use arguments under the
guise of the First Amendment). In the context of communications law, a First Amendment right of access to transmitted
signals argument has been rejected as to subscription television. California Satellite Sys. v. Seimon, 767 F.2d 1364 , 1367-
68 (9th Cir.1985). Upholding the injunctive relief, the court determined that the defendant enjoyed no right of access, when
""the sole and exclusive use to which the defendant has put his equipment is the unlawful pirating of plaintiff's signal."" Id. at
1368. The court found that the district court's injunction was targeted specifically at the infringing activity and, therefore, did
not infringe on any First Amendment interests of the defendant. We also have determined that the permanent injunction
entered in this case is limited in scope, including only defendants-appellants' actions which violate section 605. See id.

Moreover, commercial speech, accorded lesser protection than other constitutionally guaranteed expression, may be
banned if it relates to illegal activity. Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557 , 563-64,
100 S.Ct. 2343 2350, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980) ; Florida Businessmen for Free Enter.

Page 850

v. City of Hollywood, 673 F.2d 1213 , 1217 (11th Cir.1982). Although defendants-appellants do not characterize their speech
as commercial, we find that Kenny's commentary, regarding various pirate chips and other decoding devices, appropriately
comports with the Supreme Court's description of commercial expression, which ""not only serves the economic interest of
the speaker, but also assists consumers and furthers the societal interest in the fullest possible dissemination of
information."" Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 561-62 , 100 S.Ct. at 2349 . The involvement of the First Amendment in
commercial speech ""is based on the informational function of advertising."" Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 563 , 100 S.Ct. at
2350 . In this case, Kenny promoted descrambling devices for plaintiffs-appellees' subscription programming, and assisted
in the creation, advertisement and sale of pirated chips to compromise the copyrighted CMS program within the U-30 chip of
the VideoCipher TMII. ""If that [commercial] activity is deemed ‘speech,’ then it is speech proposing an illegal transaction,
which a government may regulate or ban entirely."" Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.. 455 U.S.
489 , 496, 102 S.Ct. 1186 1192, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982) ; see also Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human
Relations. 413 U.S. 376 , 389, 93 S.Ct. 2553 2561, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973) (""Any First Amendment interest which might be
served by advertising an ordinary commercial proposal and which might arguably outweigh the governmental interest
supporting the regulation is altogether absent when the commercial activity itself is illegal and the restriction on advertising is
incidental to a valid limitation on economic activity."").

Because we have concluded that Kenny's commercial speech through Network not only violated the copyright and
communications laws, but also encouraged third parties to do so, we hold that defendants-appellants have no protection
under the First Amendment for their unlawful expression. Kenny's weak warnings of illegality are meaningless in his overall
sales pitch, especially when he was aware that pirate chips and decoding devices were unlawful and advised his audience
on methods to evade American laws, such as purchase abroad. Since the First Amendment provides no defense to Kenny
and Network, our conclusion that summary judgment was proper as to their violation of the copyright and communications
laws stands.

B. The Award of Statutory Damages Without Trial


--- Page 10 ---
The district court's final judgment and decree of permanent injunction awarded plaintiffs statutory damages of
$20,000.00 against defendants Kenny, Network and Cooper based on their willful, direct and contributory copyright
infringements and for-profit violations of the communications laws. The district court also awarded plaintiffs additional
statutory damages against Kenny and Network for their separate willful, for-profit communications violations. As a
procedural matter, the plaintiff copyright owner must have registered the copyright prior to the infringement in order to obtain
statutory damages. 17 U.S.C. Sec. 412 (1982); Evans Newton Inc. v. Chicago Sys. Software, 793 F.2d 889 , 897 (7th Cir.),
cert. denied, 479 U.S. 949 , 107 S.Ct. 434 , 93 L.Ed.2d 383 (1986) .

Both the copyright and communications statutes allow the aggrieved party to elect either actual or statutory damages.
17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(b), (c) (1982); 47 U.S.C. Sec. 605(d)(3)(C)(i) (Supp. V 1987). Under each statute at the time of this
action, the statutory damages to be awarded per copyright infringement or communications violation are not less than
$250.00 or more than $10,000.00, ""as the court considers just."" 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(c)(1); 47 U.S.C. Sec. 605(d)(3)(C)(i) (II).
In this case, plaintiffs elected statutory damages, which they may choose whether or not adequate evidence exists as to the
actual damages incurred by plaintiffs or the profits gained by defendants. Harris v. Emus Records Corp., 734 F.2d 1329 ,
1335 (9th Cir.1984); 3 Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 14.04[A]. Generally, statutory damages are awarded when no actual
damages are proven, or actual damages and profits are difficult or impossible to calculate. F.W. Woolworth Co. v.
Contemporary

Page 851

Arts, Inc., 344 U.S. 228 , 231-33, 73 S.Ct. 222 , 224-25, 97 L.Ed.2d 276 (1952) ; Warner Bros. Inc. v. Dae Rim Trading. Inc.
877 F.2d 1120 , 1126 (2d Cir.1989). Plaintiffs-appellees have represented that profits could not be calculated because of
defendants-appellants' failure to produce the necessary documentation.

The Copyright Act provides that ""where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that
infringement was committed willfully, the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not
more than $50,000.00"" for each infringement. 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(c)(2); Fitzgerald Publishing Co. v. Baylor Publishing Co.
807 F.2d 1110, 1116-17 (2d Cir.1986). ""Willfully,"" in the context of section 504(c)(2), means that the defendant ""knows his
actions constitute an infringement; the actions need not have been malicious."" Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Xanthas, Inc., 855
F.2d 233 , 236 (5th Cir.1988); RCA/Ariola Int'l, Inc. v. Thomas & Grayston Co., 845 F.2d 773 , 779 (8th Cir.1988); 3 Nimmer
on Copyright Sec. 14.04[B]; see also Fitzgerald Publishing Co., 807 F.2d at 1117 (""The statute does not distinguish between
those who maliciously infringe another's copyright or those who simply act knowing that they are infringing upon the
copyright.""). Furthermore, when the infringement is willful, ""deterrence of future violations is a legitimate consideration""
because "" ‘defendants must not be able to sneer in the face of copyright owners and copyright laws."" "" International Korwin
Corp. v. Kowalezyk, 855 F.2d 375 , 383 (7th Cir.1988) (quoting and affirming International Korwin Corp. v. Kowalczyk, 665
F.Supp. 652 , 659 (N.D.III.1987)); see F.W. Woolworth Co., 344 U.S. at 233 , 73 S.Ct. at 225 . In this case, we have no
doubt that Kenny knew that M/A-COM's CMS program within the U-30 chip was copyrighted and that he not only assisted in
the production of pirate chips by giving funds and equipment to Bepko and Ward, but also that he openly publicized and
encouraged the purchase of these pirate chips as well as others on Boresight in blatant defiance of the copyright laws.
Given the alleged educational function of Boresight and Kenny's touted knowledge of the satellite programming industry,
any assertions that he did not know that the CMS program of the U-30 chip was copyrighted are not credible.

Under the Communications Act, in a case where the court finds ""that the violation was committed willfully and for
purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain, the court in its discretion may increase the
award of damages, whether actual or statutory, by an amount of not more than $50,000.00."" 47 U.S.C. Sec. 605(d)(3)(C)(ii).
The Supreme Court's definition of ""willful"" in the context of a civil statute as conduct showing "" ‘disregard for the governing
statute and an indifference to its requirements’ "" has been utilized for communications violations under section 605. ON/TV,
763 F.2d at 844 (quoting Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111 , 127,105 S.Ct. 613 , 625, 83 L.Ed.2d 523
(1985) ). Commercial advantage or private financial gain is not pertinent to finding a violation of section 605(a), but is
material in determining an enhanced civil damage award. 47 U.S.C. Sec. 605(d)(3)(C)(ii).

Kenny's flagrant violations of section 605 show his disregard for the statutory requirements with which he was familiar
given his knowledge of the satellite programming industry and the information that he disseminated over Boresight. He has
conceded that his sole source of income during 1986 was proceeds from his Bag-O-Parts business, and that he profited
more than $17,000.00 from sales of Bag-O-Parts and various chips advertised on Boresight. Kenny also has admitted that
he was paid $14,500.00 to videotape the instructive sessions at the Descrambling Summit. The anticipated receipt of
additional revenues from videotape sales provided Kenny and Network a significant financial incentive for promoting the
Descrambling Summit on Boresight in order to assure its success. Furthermore, Kenny openly referred to his monetary
interests in publicizing on Boresight his various devices and services, such as removing the U-30 chip from a customer's

Page 852

circuitry board and installing a socket to facilitate the insertion of pirate chips. We have no difficulty in determining that
defendants-appellants' section 605 violations were willfully committed for direct and indirect financial gain not only because
of Kenny's boastful statements to this effect on Boresight, but also because of the actual profits obtained from these
violations.

""[T]he employment of the statutory yardstick, within set limits, is committed solely to the court which hears the case,
and this fact takes the matter out of the ordinary rule with respect to abuse of discretion."" Douglas v. Cunningham, 294 U.S.
207 , 210,55 S.Ct. 365 , 366, 79 L.Ed. 862 (1935) ; see also Xanthas, 855 F.2d at 237 (""The statute by its terms places no



--- Page 11 ---
further limits on the district court's discretion.""); Harris, 734 F.2d at 1335 (""The court has wide discretion in determining the
amount of statutory damages to be awarded, constrained only by the specified maxima and minima."" (citing L.A.
Westermann Co. v. Dispatch Printing Co., 249 U.S. 100 , 39 S.Ct. 194 , 63 L.Ed. 499 (1919) )). In awarding statutory
damages, the court ""may take into account the attitude and conduct of the parties."" Warner Bros., 877 F.2d at 1126 ; see
also F.W. Woolworth Co., 344 U.S. at 233 , 73 S.Ct. at 225 (""The statutory rule ... is designed to discourage wrongful
conduct.... Even for uninjurious and unprofitable invasions of copyright the court may, if it deems it just, impose a liability
within statutory limits to sanction and vindicate the statutory policy."") Fitzgerald Publishing Co., 807 F.2d at 1117 (""[T]he
potential for discouraging the defendant is factored into the determination of the award.""). In its broad discretion for
determining statutory damages, the district court should consider both the willfulness of the defendant's conduct and the
deterrent value of the sanction imposed. In this case, we are mindful not only of Kenny's open promotion on Boresight of the
purchase of pirate chips and other devices to compromise the VideoCipher TMIl, but also of his continued advertisements
following entry of the preliminary injunction. Cf. Transgo, Inc. v. Ajac Transmission Parts Corp., 768 F.2d 1001 , 1022-23 (9th
Cir.1985) (The court held an infringer in civil contempt for violating an injunction for using a trademark name and imposed
investigation costs.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1059 , 106 S.Ct. 802 , 88 L.Ed.2d 778 (1986) .

The district court did not describe how it arrived at the statutory damages that it awarded by clarifying the number of
copyright infringements and communications violations which occurred and the value within the statutory limits assigned to
each infringement or violation, as some courts meticulously have done. See, e.g., Xanthas, 855 F.2d at 236 , 240. While an
explanation would have been helpful, we cannot say that the joint and several award of $20,000.00 against Kenny, Network
and Cooper for willful, direct and contributory copyright infringements and for-profit communications violations as well as the
$110,000.00 award against Kenny and Network for separate willful, for-profit communications violations are outside the
statutory limitations under various combinations of the number of infringements and communications violations multiplied by
the court's assigned values under the respective statutes. We cannot justify remand and the expenditure of judicial effort in
order to delineate numbers and values for infringements and communications violations when the resulting statutory award
likely would remain the same. Given the wide latitude accorded the district court in awarding statutory damages, bounded
only by the statutory limits, and especially with defendants-appellants' conduct warranting enhancement under both statutes,
we hold that the statutory awards by the district court are not an abuse of discretion. Harris, 734 F.2d at 1335 .

Defendants-appellants complain on appeal that they were entitled to a bench or jury trial on the issue of statutory
damages. We quickly dispense with this contention. The former Fifth Circuit has held that, in an equitable copyright
infringement action seeking only minimum statutory damages and injunctive relief, there is ""no constitutional or statutory
right to a jury trial."" Twentieth Century Music

Page 853

Corp. v. Frith, 645 F.2d 6 , 7 (5th Cir. Unit B May 1981) (per curiam). Accordingly, we now hold that the latitude granted the
district court's great discretion in awarding statutory damages does not entitle defendants to a jury or bench trial as to an
award of damages within the statutory limits of both the Copyright Act and the Communications Act, provided that the
parties may submit all of their supporting evidence to the district court.

C. The Award of Attorneys' Fees

The district court awarded $451,789.06 in attorneys’ fees and costs, after reviewing and adopting the magistrate's
report and recommendation. The magistrate independently reviewed the entire record and conducted an evidentiary hearing,
including expert testimony, in making his determination. He was impressed by the deletions that plaintiffs made in their
attorneys’ fee request, such as investigation of original claims subsequently abandoned and settlement negotiations with
other defendants. He also was influenced by the value to M/A-COM and Cable/Home of the copyrighted CMS program,
evidenced by revenue generated from sales of the VideoCipher TMI, and their desire to protect against infringement. The
magistrate considered the precedential Johnson factors in deciding upon the award. 3” Johnson v. Georgia Highway
Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 , 717-19 (5th Cir.1974).

With the prerequisite of a registered copyright before infringement, the Copyright Act explicitly provides that ""the court
in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party ... [and] may also award a reasonable attorney's
fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs."" 17 U.S.C. Secs. 412, 505; Sony, 464 U.S. at 434 , 104 S.Ct. at 784 . An
attorneys’ fee award is ""generally discretionary, seldom mandatory."" Casella, 820 F.2d at 366 . In this circuit, a showing of
bad faith or frivolity is not a precondition to awarding attorneys' fees. Id.; Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Toy Loft, Inc.,
684 F.2d 821 , 832 (11th Cir.1982). We have adhered to the only two statutory requirements: the fee award should be
granted to the prevailing party and the amount should be reasonable. Casella, 820 F.2d at 366 ; Original Appalachian
Artworks, 684 F.2d at 832 .

Generally, the prevailing party under the attorneys' fee authorization of section 505 of the Copyright Act is identified as
the party succeeding on a significant litigated issue that achieves some of the benefits sought by that party in initiating the
suit. Warner Bros., 877 F.2d at 1126 ; see Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 , 429, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933 , 1937 1939. 76
L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) ; Hartman v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., 833 F.2d 117 , 122 (8th Cir.1987). ""A party's success on a claim that is
‘purely technical or de minimis ' does not qualify him as a ‘prevailing party.’ "" Warner Bros., 877 F.2d at 1126 (quoting Texas
State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. School Dist., --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 1486 1492, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989) ). Given
plaintiffs-appellees' success in protecting the subject copyrights and their programming, the principal objectives of this
lawsuit, we have no difficulty in concluding that they are the prevailing parties in this action.

In this circuit, the reasonableness of the attorneys’ fee award is controlled by consideration of the Johnson factors.

Southern Bell, 756 F.2d at 813 ;
Page 854

see United Feature Syndicate, Inc. v. Sunrise Mold Co., 569 F.Supp. 1475 , 1481 (S.D.Fla.1983). Furthermore, while
willfulness does not compel a fee award, it is an ""important factor"" in the district court's ""discretionary decisionmaking.""
Casella, 820 F.2d at 366 ; see also Roulo v. Russ Berrie & Co., 886 F.2d 931 , 942 (7th Cir.1989), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----,
110 S.Ct. 1124 , 107 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1990) ; International Korwin, 855 F.2d at 384 (The Seventh Circuit has determined that
a finding of willfulness will support an attorneys’ fee award.). The magistrate, to whom the district judge referred this case for
the specific purpose of recommending an attorneys’ fee award, not only reviewed the entire record, but also conducted an
evidentiary hearing on this issue. His report and recommendation explained that he weighed the Johnson factors in
determining the attorneys’ fee award and that he was concerned with defendants’ flagrantly willful conduct. See Casella, 820
F.2d at 366-67 ; Southern Bell, 756 F.2d at 813 . This recommendation was reviewed and adopted by the district court.
Thus, we are presented with a detailed explanation and basis for the award, which is supported fully by the record. The
ruling completely complies with the discretion accorded under section 505. °° Southern Bell, 756 F.2d at 813 ; Frith, 645 F.2d
at 7 ; see also Casella, 820 F.2d at 367 (This court remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the attorneys’ fee
issue and to “articulate its rationale for granting or denying attorney's fees."").

Furthermore, we are concerned, as were the reviewing magistrate and district court, with defendants-appellants'
outrageously willful conduct in assisting in the development of pirate chips, advertising these pirate chips and other devices,
participating at the Descrambling Summit for the purpose of compromising the VideoCipher TMIl, and instructing Boresight
audiences on ways to break the VideoCipher TMIl, in blatant disregard of the copyright laws. We view defendants-
appellants’ willfulness as an important factor in the district court's attorneys’ fee award. See Casella, 820 F.2d at 366 ; Lieb v.
Topstone Indus.. Inc., 788 F.2d 151 , 156 (3d Cir.1986). As we have stressed, "" 'the court's choice of discretionary ruling
should be in furtherance of the policies of the law that are being enforced, as informed by the court's familiarity with the
matter in litigation and the interest of justice.’ "" Casella, 820 F.2d at 367 (quoting S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. v. Carter-Wallace
Inc.. 781 F.2d 198 , 201 (Fed.Cir.1986)).

D. Denial of the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction
Defendants-appellants Kenny and Network have claimed that the district court
Page 855

erred in denying their motion to dismiss on the basis of personal jurisdiction. They have argued that neither is a citizen of
Florida and that they do not engage in business, or have offices, agents or employees in Florida. Additionally, defendants-
appellants assert that the transmission of their programming into the state does not constitute the conduct of substantial
activities within the state. The district court denied defendants-appellants' motion to dismiss, based on lack of personal
jurisdiction as well as other grounds, in an omnibus order without explanation.

Our review of the denial of a motion to dismiss founded on lack of personal jurisdiction is de novo. See Alexander
Proudfoot Co. World Headquarters L.P. v. Thayer, 877 F.2d 912 , 916 (11th Cir.1989). When the district court does not
conduct a discretionary evidentiary hearing on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff must establish
a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant. Morris v. SSE, Inc., 843 F.2d 489 , 492 (11th
Cir.1988); Delong Equip. Co. v. Washington Mills Abrasive Co., 840 F.2d 843 , 845 (11th Cir.1988). ""A prima facie case is
established if the plaintiff presents sufficient evidence to defeat a motion for directed verdict."" Morris, 843 F.2d at 492 . The
district court must accept the facts alleged in the complaint as true, to the extent that they are uncontroverted by the
defendant's affidavits. Id.; Delong Equip. Co., 840 F.2d at 845 . Where the parties’ affidavit and deposition evidence conflict,
the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Morris, 843 F.2d at 492 ; Delong Equip. Co.,
840 F.2d at 845 .

The determination of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant requires a two-part analysis by the federal
courts. Alexander Proudfoot Co., 877 F.2d at 919 ; see Omni Capital Int'l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97 , 104-05,
108 S.Ct. 404 , 409-10, 98 L.Ed.2d 415 (1987) ; Williams Electric Co. v. Honeywell, Inc.. 854 F.2d 389 , 391 (11th Cir.1988)
(per curiam); Delong Equip. Co., 840 F.2d at 847 . First, we must examine the jurisdictional issue under the state long-arm
statute. Alexander Proudfoot Co., 877 F.2d at 919 ; Delong Equip. Co., 840 F.2d at 847 ; see Omni Capital Int'l, 484 U.S. at
104-05 , 108 S.Ct. at 409-10 ; Williams Electric Co., 854 F.2d at 391 . Second, we must ascertain whether or not sufficient
""minimum contacts"" exist to satisfy the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment so that ""maintenance of the suit
does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'"" International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310
, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154 , 158, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457 , 463, 61 S.Ct. 339 , 342, 85 L.Ed. 278
(1940) ); Alexander Proudfoot Co., 877 F.2d at 919 ; see Omni Capital Int'l, 484 U.S. at 104 , 108 S.Ct. at 409 ; Williams
Electric Co., 854 F.2d at 391 ; Delong Equip. Co., 840 F.2d at 847 .

When jurisdiction is based on a federal question arising under a statute that is silent regarding service of process, Rule
4(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that both assertion of jurisdiction and service of process be determined
by state amenability standards, or the state long-arm statute. 9°? Max Daetwyler

Corp. v. R. Meyer, 762 F.2d 290 , 295 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 980 , 106 S.Ct. 383 , 88 L.Ed.2d 336 (1985) ; DeMelo



--- Page 13 ---
v. Toche Marine, Inc., 711 F.2d 1260 , 1265-66 (5th Cir.1983); see Omni Capital Int'l, 484 U.S. at 105 , 108 S.Ct. at 410 ;
Delong Equip. Co., 840 F.2d at 847 . While jurisdiction exists in the district court for copyright and communications statutory
violations, there is no service of process provision for either statute. See 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1331, 1338 (1982). Accordingly,
Rule 4(e) directs us to the Florida long-arm statute in order to determine the amenability of nonresident defendants-
appellants to jurisdiction in Florida. Fla.Stat. Sec. 48.193 (1987); see Bangor Punta Operations, Inc. v. Universal Marine Co.,
543 F.2d 1107 , 1108 (5th Cir.1976); see also Rebozo v. Washington Post Co., 515 F.2d 1208 , 1212 (5th Cir.1975) (The
intent of the Florida long-arm statute has been interpreted to ""further facilitate the state's power to act extraterritorially."").

Since the extent of the long-arm statute is governed by Florida law, ""federal courts are required to construe it as would
the Florida Supreme Court."" Oriental Imports & Exports, Inc. v. Maduro & Curiel's Bank, N.V., 701 F.2d 889 , 890-91 (11th
Cir.1983). The Florida Supreme Court has explicated section 48.193, explaining that complying with the long-arm statute
and determining federal constitutional minimum contacts are discrete analyses:

By enacting section 48.193, the legislature has determined the requisite basis for obtaining jurisdiction over nonresident
defendants as far as Florida is concerned. It has not specifically addressed whether the federal constitutional requirement of
minimum contacts has been met. As a practical matter, it could not do so because each case will depend upon the facts.

Venetian Salami Co. v. Parthenais, 554 So.2d 499, 500 (Fla.1989). Without addressing the potential appropriateness
of other provisions of the Florida long-arm statute to nonresidents Kenny and Network, we limit our analysis to the tortious
act provision because it is applicable and sufficient. 4° Fla.Stat. Sec. 48.193(1)(b).

Nonresident defendants have been found liable under the tortious act provision when the precise location of the
alleged tort within the state has been difficult to identify. See Oriental Imports & Exports, 701 F.2d at 894 . In Rebozo and
Bangor Punta, the respective torts of alleged libel in an out-of-state newspaper circulated in Florida and violation of property
rights in building trawlers advertised and sold by a foreign corporate defendant in Florida constituted tortious acts under the
long-arm statute. The former Fifth Circuit stressed that ""the breach of a common law copyright subjects the wrongdoer to
liability in tort"" within the reach of the Florida long-arm statute. Bangor Punta, 543 F.2d at 1109 . Additionally, the long-arm
statute is not limited to an act in Florida causing injury in Florida, but includes ""the situation in which a foreign tortious act
causes injury within the forum."" Rebozo, 515 F.2d at 1212 ; Bangor Punta, 543 F.2d at 1109 ; see also Edy Clover Prods.
Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 572 F.2d 119 (3d Cir.1978) (On an interlocutory appeal from a denial of a motion to
dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction, the court found no unfairness in requiring a television producer to answer a
copyright infringement charge in a remote forum receiving the broadcast.); German Educ. Television Network, Ltd. v. Oregon

Service"" and subjected marketers of infringing programming proposals to personal jurisdiction under New York's tortious act

defendant can be held personally liable for acts committed in the forum, not whether his contacts with the forum arose in his
personal capacity."" Delong Equip. Co., 840 F.2d at 852 .

In this case, we have found violations of both the copyright and communications laws. This court has recognized that ""
[flor personal jurisdiction to attach under the ‘tortious activity’ provision of the Florida long-arm statute, the plaintiff must
demonstrate that the non-resident defendant 'committed a substantial aspect of the alleged tort in Florida’ by establishing
that the activities in Florida 'w[ere] essential to the success of the tort.'"" Williams Electric Co., 854 F.2d at 394 (quoting
Watts v. Haun, 393 So.2d 54 , 56 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1981)). The cumulative receipt of Boresight programming, which caused
the purchase of pirate chips and other devices to compromise the VideoCipher TMIl for the profit of defendants-appellants,
made the sales in individual states essential. We, therefore, find the Boresight broadcasts, which stimulated Florida
purchases in violation of the copyright and communications laws, to be substantial. Furthermore, connections through a
Florida travel agent were essential for attending the Descrambling Summit, which Kenny promoted through Boresight and
from which he derived profits. Given these tortious acts committed by defendants-appellants in Florida, we conclude that
section 48.193(1)(b) is applicable to them.

Having found the tortious act provision of the Florida long-arm statute applicable to defendants-appellants, we must
analyze this long-arm jurisdiction under the due process requirements of the federal constitution. The Florida Supreme Court
has acknowledged that ""[t]he mere proof of any one of the several circumstances enumerated in section 48.193 as the basis
for obtaining jurisdiction of nonresidents does not automatically satisfy the due process requirement of minimum contacts,""
although implicit within some of the provisions are sufficient facts, which if proved would suffice. Venetian Salami Co., 554
So.2d at 502 . This court has recognized that the instruction of International Shoe Co. and its progeny is that the
determination of whether or not the assumption of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant conforms with due
process, requires a dual analysis: first, we must ascertain if defendants-appellants have established "" ‘minimum contacts
with Florida, the forum state; second, we must decide if the exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants-
appellants in Florida would offend "" 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'"" Williams Electric Co., 854 F.2d at

orum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws."" Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235 , 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228

personal jurisdiction in the forum state. See Burger King Corp., 471 U.S. at 476 , 105 S.Ct. at 2184 ; Morris, 843 F.2d at 495

Guided by these constitutional principles, we examine defendants-appellants' activities in Florida. Weekly, Boresight
programming was directed purposefully to Florida as well as to the rest of the broadcast area. Because arrangements for
and transportation to and from the Descrambling Summit, in which defendants-appellants participated, were through a
Florida travel agent, the benefits and protections of that state were utilized. Therefore, Florida has a reasonable interest in
this litigation. We find that the quality and nature of defendants-appellants' activities in Florida included instruction on
methods for compromising the VideoCipher TMIl, advertisement and sale of pirate chips, other devices and services for that
purpose, culminating in the Descrambling Summit. All of these activities, violating the copyright and communications laws,
are determinative of the amenability of defendants-appellants to personal jurisdiction in Florida. We are convinced that
defendants-appellants had constitutional minimum contacts with Florida for personal jurisdiction there.

Having determined that defendants-appellants have sufficient minimum contacts with Florida, we must complete our
analysis by ascertaining whether or not the exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants-appellants would transgress
traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. ""When minimum contacts have been established, often the interests of
the plaintiff and the forum in the exercise of jurisdiction will justify even the serious burdens placed on the alien defendant.""
Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102 , 114, 107 S.Ct. 1026 1034, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987) ; Williams Electric

purposefully has directed his activities at forum residents seeks to defeat jurisdiction, he must present a compelling case that
the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.""). Furthermore, ""modern transportation
and communication have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a State where he engages in
economic activity."" McGee v. International Life Ins. Co.. 355 U.S. 220 , 223, 78 S.Ct. 199 , 201, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957) ;

Co., 854 F.2d at 393 . Significantly, a purposeful journey to Florida for a reason related to the litigation has been considered
a deliberate choice placing defendants on notice that they were subject to suit in Florida. Williams Electric Co., 854 F.2d at
393.

Defendants-appellants have not presented compelling reasons for finding that personal jurisdiction in Florida would be
unreasonable. They purposefully have directed unlawful activity in violation of the copyright and communications laws to
Florida. Moreover, Kenny traveled to Florida in order to participate in the Descrambling Summit, the purpose of which was to
instruct in further deliberate violations of the copyright and communications laws and from which defendants-appellants
profited.

We find applicable the reasoning of the former Fifth Circuit in an analogous case, where the out-of-state defendant
sought to escape liability on the basis of lack of personal jurisdiction:

The legal principle urged upon us by appellants would allow a publisher, fully aware of the strong possibility of resulting legal
action, to print libelous matters directed at persons in distant localities, yet remain free from suit in such localities in spite of
the pecuniary benefits gained in that very jurisdiction where it asserts it cannot be held legally accountable.

Rebozo, 515 F.2d at 1215 (quoting Curtis Publishing Co. v. Golino, 383 F.2d 586 , 591 (5th Cir.1967)). Holding
defendants-appellants amenable to personal jurisdiction in Florida does not contravene basic notions of fair play and
substantial justice. Furthermore, we conclude that plaintiffs-appellees have established a personal jurisdiction prima facie
case, which defendants-appellants have not rebutted convincingly. Our review of the record does not leave us with the ""



--- Page 15 ---
‘definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed’ "" by the district court in denying the motion by Kenny and
Network to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction; we agree that the district court did have personal jurisdiction over them.
Williams Electric Co., 854 F.2d at 393 (quoting Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 , 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504 1511
84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) ).

E. Denial of the Motion for Additional Time to Respond to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment

Defendants-appellants complain that they were ""severely prejudiced"" by the district court's ""forc[ing]"" them to respond
to plaintiffs' summary judgment motion within ten days, shortly after their recent acquisition of new counsel. Appellants’
Reply Brief at 25. We note that the subject motion was defendants' second request for enhanced time to respond to
plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion. Their first motion for an extension of time was denied because of their repeated failure
to comply with court orders and local rules. Although the district court granted plaintiffs' unopposed motion for summary
judgment, it allowed their new counsel ten days to file an opposition. We are aware that defendants’ Rule 59(e) motion,
based upon their failure to respond timely because of the acquisition of new counsel, also was dilatory. Despite the district
court's admonition that no additional response time would be allowed, defendants' new counsel moved for an additional ten
days to respond to plaintiffs' summary judgment motion. This request was denied by the district court. Interestingly,
defendants’ counsel filed their opposition to plaintiffs' summary judgment motion within the first extension of time granted by
the district court.

We find that the district court was abundantly generous with the time that it granted defendants to file a response to
plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion in the face of obstructionist and delinquent conduct by defendants. This appellate issue
by defendants-appellants is completely without merit. We conclude that the district court's denial of a second request for
extension of time to respond to plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion, after it had advised that it would not do so when
granting an extension pursuant to defendants’ Rule 59(e) motion, was not an abuse of discretion because it was not
arbitrary or unreasonable. See Hashwani v. Barbar,

Page 860

822 F.2d 1038 , 1040 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (affirming denial of the continuance of a summary judgment hearing as
being within the broad discretion of the district court); see also Instituto Nacional de Comercializacion Agricola v. Continental
Illinois Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 858 F.2d 1264 , 1271-72 (7th Cir.1988); United States v. Kasuboski, 834 F.2d 1345 , 1351-52
(7th Cir.1987) (finding no abuse of discretion by the district court in not allowing an extension of time to oppose a summary
judgment motion).

In summary, the district court's orders granting summary judgment to plaintiffs-appellees, awarding them damages
without trial, awarding them requested attorneys' fees, denying defendants-appellants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal
jurisdiction, and denying their motion for a second extension of time to respond to plaintiffs' summary judgment motion are
AFFIRMED.

17 Cable/Home Communications Corp. v. Heller, No. CIV 87-0017 PHX-CLH (D.Ariz. filed Jan. 7, 1987). Kenny purchased a pirate chip from a defendant
in this lawsuit for $400.00.

18 In addition to defendants-appellants, the original complaint included former defendants Cooper, Howes and Bepko. Subsequently, former defendant
Bepko and plaintiffs agreed to a final consent judgment and permanent injunction, and former defendant Howes was dismissed from the case by the
district court pursuant to her settlement with plaintiffs. Former defendant Ward was added as a defendant in the second amended complaint, the
operative complaint in this action. Ward was dismissed from the case pursuant to his entering into a final consent judgment and permanent injunction
with plaintiffs. Although he remained a defendant in the case, Cooper has not appealed to this court.

19 Upon plaintiffs’ application for temporary amplification or modification of the preliminary injunction, the district court subsequently enlarged the
preliminary injunction to require defendants to place all proceeds from a potential sale or transfer of any right or interest in Network in an interest-bearing
escrow account identified to the court. Furthermore, defendants Network and Kenny were enjoined from removing their assets from the United States
and concealing or encumbering their assets within the United States.

20 We note that the five orders appealed in this case are bare rulings without factual findings or legal conclusions by the district court. We recognize that
Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary for decisions on motions under
Rules 12 and 56. Nevertheless, with particular regard to a grant of summary judgment, it is helpful to understand the reasoning of the district court.

21 Plaintiffs were represented by two law firms, one requesting a fee of $397,523.00 and costs of $8,338.07, and the other requesting a fee of
$39,859.65 and costs of $6,068.34. Testimony at the evidentiary hearing revealed that the firms consciously avoided duplicating research time spent on
the legal issues in the case. Furthermore, time for which the clients were billed, such as investigation of original claims, subsequently relinquished,
settlement negotiations with other defendants, and communications with the United States Customs Service and the press, was deleted from plaintiffs’
requested fees. The magistrate found that plaintiffs' explanatory testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing regarding attorneys' fees and costs was
unrebutted.

22 Following his review of the entire record from the perspective of the twelve guidelines in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 ,
717-19 (5th Cir.1974), the magistrate's order explains his reasoning for the recommended award of attorneys’ fees and costs for the defendants’
copyright and communications violations:

This is not Goliath taking revenge on David. Significantly, defendants utalized [sic] satellite broadcasts to reach viewers throughout the United States as
well as international audiences. Defendants did not hesitate to solicit funds from their viewing audience in attempting to defend this lawsuit. Additionally,
documentation exists in the record to demonstrate that a substantial number of persons attended the ""Descrambling Summit"" sponsored by defendants.

This Court is impressed with the quality of pleadings it has reviewed and the meticulous documentation presented by plaintiffs in substantiation of the
costs and fees sought. Plaintiffs’ expert was familiar with the record and offered credible testimony in support of plaintiffs’ applications for fees and costs.
In contrast, defendants have not offered, and this Court is unable to locate, any evidence which demonstrates plaintiffs' requests for fees and costs are
unreasonable.

27 Franklin includes a thorough discussion of computer programming technology and legislative history of the 1980 amendments to the Copyright Act
incorporating computer programs in its coverage. Because the Third Circuit instructively has explicated these areas, we will not duplicate that insightful
exposition. Franklin, 714 F.2d at 1249-54 .

28 There has been no issue in this case of the validity of M/A-COM's copyright for the CMS program within the U-30 chip contained in the VideoCipher
TMII, or of the Dealer Demo chip being an 86% copy of that CMS program, elements of a prima facie, copyright infringement case establishing copying.
Donald Frederick Evans & Assocs., Inc. v. Continental Homes, Inc., 785 F.2d 897 , 903 (11th Cir.1986); Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Toy Loft
Inc.. 684 F.2d 821 , 824 (11th Cir.1982); see 17 U.S.C. Sec. 501 (1982); Sony, 464 U.S. at 433 , 104 S.Ct. at 784 . Defendants-appellants allege,
however, that they were not aware that the CMS program within the U-30 chip was copyrighted. They apparently claim that the copyright notice inside the
VideoCipher TMIl or on the CMS program was not evident. We note that a copyright notice on a compilation is sufficient; even a defective or omitted
notice does not impair copyright protection under the Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C. Sec. 405 (1982); Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Associated Tel. Directory
Publishers, 756 F.2d 801 , 811 (11th Cir.1985); Original Appalachian Artworks, 684 F.2d at 826-27 ; see also Tennessee Fabricating, 421 F.2d at 280-81
(Defendants were found to have infringed plaintiff's copyrighted architectural metal casting unit, although the unit that they used as a mold had the
copyright notice obscured by paint.). While the notice was not apparent within the CMS computer program, it would have been obvious to anyone who
removed the chip for the purpose of duplicating it in detail.

29 See, e.g., Columbia Pictures Indus.. Inc. v. Aveco, Inc.. 800 F.2d 59 , 62 (3d Cir.1986) (Although defendant's customers actually placed the video
cassette of copyrighted motion pictures in the video cassette player and operated the controls, defendant was liable for contributory infringement for
renting rooms for this purpose.); Wales Indus. Inc. v. Hasbro Bradley, Inc., 612 F.Supp. 510 , 518 (S.D.N.Y.1985) (Independent sales representatives,
who advertised and promoted infringing products, may be held jointly and severally liable upon proof that they knew or should have known of the
infringer's conduct whether or not they had any interest in or control over the infringer.); Screen Gems-Columbia Music, Inc. v. Mark-Fi Records, Inc.
256 F.Supp. 399 , 404-05 (S.D.N.Y.1966) (Advertising agency, radio station that advertised the infringer's pirated records, and the packager that boxed
and mailed the infringing records may all be held jointly and severally liable with the infringing manufacturer for copyright infringement if they knew or
should have known of the infringement by such indications as a price suspiciously below the market price.).

30 Defendants-appellants have argued that they advertised and sold noninfringing products. For example, they contend that Kenny sold the Dealer Demo
chip to satellite dish dealers for the purpose of demonstrating programming, that the installation of a socket in the slot containing the U-30 chip facilitated
the insertion of a repair or diagnostic chip, and that the Bag-O-Parts kit was a device to ""clean up"" old video tapes, although they concede that these
devices also decode the scrambled signals of the VideoCipher TMII. Appellants’ Brief at 15-19. While these alternative uses may be legitimate, we are
not convinced that defendants-appellants used, promoted and sold these devices for any purpose other than to compromise the VideoCipher TMII.

31 We note that granting summary judgment for contributory infringement has been upheld in cases with facts less compelling than the facts of this case.
See, e.g., Redd Horne, 749 F.2d at 160-61 (affirming summary judgment for contributory infringement and permanent injunction against corporate
defendant that advertised and promoted the infringing company's renting video cassette viewing booths for viewing plaintiffs' copyrighted films, despite
imputed knowledge of infringing activities through defendant's president who participated in the infringement and ignored plaintiffs’ persistent requests
that the infringing activity cease); Gershwin Publishing Corp., 443 F.2d at 1160-63 (affirming summary judgment for contributory infringement and
permanent injunction against promoter that provided audiences for concerts in which performing artists infringed music copyrights).

32 The Comprehensive Cable Telecommunications Act of 1984, P.L. No. 98-549, 98 Stat. 2802 (1984 Cable Act), substantially amended and
redesignated section 605 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 as section 705. These amendments, however, are codified at 47 U.S.C. section
605. Through the amendments, Congress sought to address the problems created by the newly developed satellite cable technology. American
Television & Communications Corp. v. Floken, Ltd., 629 F.Supp. 1462 , 1468 (M.D.Fla.1986). The 1984 Cable Act preserves former section 605 virtually
intact as subsection (a), and the amended section confirms the case law under the previous section. H.R.Rep. No. 934, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted
in 1984 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 4655, 4746; Floken, 629 F.Supp. at 1469 .

33 In pertinent part, Sec. 605(a) provides:

37 In Johnson, the following considerations were found to be relevant to the determination of a reasonable attorneys’ fee award:

3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;

4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to the acceptance of the case;

5) the customary fee;

6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent;

7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances;

8) the amount involved and the results obtained;

38 Defendants-appellants also have argued that the district court erred in failing to award only a proportionate share of the attorneys’ fees against Kenny
and Network, since the suit originally was brought against four other defendants. Not only are we, as were the magistrate and district judge, impressed by
plaintiffs-appellees' deletions of time spent on original arguments not pursued and settlements with other defendants from their attorneys’ fee request,
but also this circuit has recognized that, in cases involving joint liability, counsel for prevailing parties often cannot account accurately for time spent
litigating various issues with other defendants and unsuccessful claims, which may have been relevant to successful claims. See, e.g., Freeman v. Motor
Convoy, Inc., 700 F.2d 1339 , 1357 (11th Cir.1983) (In rejecting an analogous challenge to an attorneys’ fee award against a defendant employer solely
for time spent litigating issues involving only defendant unions, this court agreed with the district court that ""plaintiffs had already excluded, to the extent
possible, the time spent on issues which only involved the defendant unions.""); Marion v. Barrier, 694 F.2d 229 , 232 (11th Cir.1982) (per curiam)
(Affirming an award of attorneys' fees, this court acknowledged that ""where evidence gathered in preparing an unsuccessful issue may also have been
relevant to the successful claim, compensation should be provided for the time spent gathering that evidence.""); 2 M. Derfner & A. Wolf, Court Awarded
Attorney Fees p 17.03[a] n. 5.1 (1988) (""[W]here time spent on claims against a prevailing defendant also contributed to success against a losing
defendant, that time will be compensated by those defendants who have not escaped liability.""); cf. Dean v. Gladney, 621 F.2d 1331 , 1340 (5th

Cir.1980) (Because the Fifth Circuit determined that the defendants were not joint tortfeasors, the case was remanded to the district court to ""apportion
the amounts of attorneys’ fees owed to appellants by each of the officers.""), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 983 , 101 S.Ct. 1521 , 67 L.Ed.2d 819 (1981).

39 The applicable language of Rule 4(e) has been analyzed as follows in concluding that the state long-arm statute governs service in federal question
cases, based on federal statutes, which do not contain a service of process provision:

Whenever a statute or rule of court of the state in which the district court is held provides ... for service of a summons, or a notice, or of an order in lieu of
summons upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state, ... service may ... be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in
the statute or rule.

circumstances,"" in the above-quoted second sentence of Rule 4(e), has been interpreted to mean amenability to service and consequent personal
jurisdiction under the long-arm statute of the state in which the district court is located. Omni Capital Int'l, 484 U.S. at 105 , 108 S.Ct. at 410 ; Max

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

YANDLE, District Judge:

Plaintiff Catherine Alexander filed the instant lawsuit against Defendants Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., 2K Games,
Inc., 2K Sports Inc., Visual Concepts Entertainment (the ""Take-Two Defendants""), and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.
(""WWE"") asserting copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. § 501. The case is now before the Court for consideration of
Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 139) and the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by the Take-Two
Defendants (Doc. 141). The parties have filed responses (Docs. 170 and 215). For the following reasons, Plaintiff's Motion is
GRANTED, and Defendants’ Motion is DENIED .+

Material Facts

Catherine Alexander is a former tattoo artist who inked six tattoos on WWE professional wrestler Randy Orton between 2002
and 2008 (Doc. 142-17, at pp. 93, 97-98, 110, 113; Doc. 142-5, at J 8, 10, 12-17). The tattoos include tribal tattoos on
Orton's forearm, a Bible verse on his arm, a dove, a rose, and a skull. /d. at p. 124; Doc. 142-5, at ff 10, 12. Orton had a
""tribal design"" on his back created by another tattooist which Alexander also extended at Orton's request (Doc. 142-17, pp.
93, 97-98, 110, 113, 124).

Defendant Take-Two is the creator of the WWE 2K series of video games (Doc. 142-1 at § 2). WWE 2Kis a realistic
depiction of WWE wrestling and includes elements that appear in real world wrestling (Doc. 142-18, at pp. 71-72; Doc. 142-
20, at p. 43; pp. 106-107). To depict Orton in WWE 2K as he appears in real life, Take-Two replicated his likeness, including
the Alexander tattoos (Doc. 142-20, at p. 43, pp. 106-107). Take-Two accomplished this by copying Orton's tattoos and
reproducing them digitally in the video games. /d. at 154. This process is referred to as ""photo reference"" in the video game
industry and required no artistic input other than a ""rote"" recreation of a reference

[489 F.Supp.3d 818]

photograph of Orton's tattoos. /d. at 149. The in-game reproduction of Orton in WWE 2K games is neither a photograph,
video, nor live broadcast; it is a digitally created, authentic, re-creation of photographs of Orton (Doc. 142-20, pp. 139-144).

Take-Two obtained a license to portray Orton's likeness in WWE 2K from WWE, which itself was licensed by Orton (Doc.
142-5, at ] 22; Doc. 142-1, at ] 7; Doc. 145-22, Doc. 145-23). WWE's agreement with Take-Two obligated WWE to approve
or disapprove of the subject video games before Take-Two could release and market the games. (Doc. 217-1, pp. 24-25;

pp. 36-44). WWE's review process included reviewing Orton's tattoos to make sure they were accurate. /d. at pp. 68-73.
WWE would have rejected Orton's videogame persona if it appeared without his tattoos or appeared with tattoos that were

different than Orton's actual tattoos as WWE would not have considered it an accurate depiction of Orton. Id.

Alexander has not worked in the tattoo industry full time since 2009 and has never licensed any tattoo to be included in
video games or anywhere else. (Doc. 142-17, at pp. 179-181, 188). During her deposition, Alexander testified she has never
told a client they needed her permission to appear in different media, such as photographs, tv shows, or videogames (Doc.
142-17, pp. 65-66, pp. 182-183), nor has she ever given permission to any of her clients to use copies of her tattoo work in
video games. /d. , at 204. She would ""take issue"" if any client were to replicate her tattoos in a manner other than in photos
or videos, including using her tattoo works to print and sell other commercial items, such as T-shirts. /d. , at 203.



--- Page 2 ---
In 2009, Alexander contacted WWE's legal department to negotiate about a possible faux sleeve product depicting her tattoo
works (Doc. 215-3, p. 25). A WWE representative laughed at her and stated she had no grounds and that they could do
what they wanted with Orton's images because he was their wrestler. /d. at pp. 30-31. WWE then offered Alexander $450 for
extensive rights to use and produce the tattoo designs on WWE products. Alexander declined the offer and advised WWE
that she did not grant it any permission to copy, duplicate, or otherwise reproduce any of her designs. Defendants have

released and promoted wrestling video games titled ""WWE 2K16"", ""WWE 2K17"", and ""WWE 2K18"" which feature Orton. /d.
at p. 205.

Discussion

Alexander moves for partial summary judgment on the issue of copying. Defendants move for summary judgment, arguing
Alexander's copyright claim fails as a matter of law for three independent reasons: Take-Two's use of the tattoos was
authorized by an implied license; the fair use doctrine insulates their utilization of the tattoos in the WWE 2k videogames;
and the tattoos are a de minimis part of WWE 2k. Defendants further argue Alexander cannot prove actual damages.

Summary judgment is proper only if the moving party can demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) ;_Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 , 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . The moving
party is entitled to summary judgment where the non-moving party ""has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential
element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof."" Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 . If the
evidence is merely colorable, or is not sufficiently probative, summary judgment may be granted. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby.
Inc., 477 U.S. 242 , 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) . Any doubt as to the existence of a genuine issue of
material

[489 F.Supp.3d 819]

fact must be resolved against the moving party. Lawrence v. Kenosha County. 391 F.3d 837 , 841 (7th Cir. 2004).

Alexander's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 139)

The owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 106(1). Copyright
infringement occurs when anyone violates the exclusive rights of a copyright owner. 17 U.S.C. § 501(a). ""A plaintiff alleging
copyright infringement must establish two elements: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of the constituent
elements of the work that are original."" Design Basics, LLC v. Lexington Homes, Inc. , 858 F.3d 1093 , 1099 (7th Cir. 2017).

""Some minimal degree of creativity,"" or ""the existence of ... intellectual production, of thought, and conception"" is required for
copyright protection. JCW Investments, Inc. v. Novelty. Inc., 482 F.3d 910 , 914-15 (7th Cir. 2007) (quoting Feist
Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340 , 362, 111 S.Ct. 1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) ).
Copyright protection begins at the moment of creation of ""original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of
expression,"" including ""pictorial, graphic, and sculptural"" works and sound recordings. 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). A work is ""fixed""
in a tangible medium of expression ""when its embodiment in a copy ... is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be
perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration."" JCW Investments, 482
F.3d at 915 ; 17 U.S.C. § 101. A certificate of copyright is "" prima facie evidence"" of the copyright's validity. /d. ; 17 U.S.C. §
410(c). If a plaintiff establishes a valid copyright, copying of the protected work by a defendant can be proven either by direct
evidence or inferred where the defendant had access to the copyrighted work and the work is substantially similar to the
copyrighted work. /d. ; see also Susan Wakeen Doll Co., Inc. v. Ashton Drake Galleries, 272 F.3d 441 , 450 (7th Cir. 2001).

Alexander argues there is no dispute of material facts as to the issue of copying because Defendants have admitted to
copying her original copyrighted tattoo artworks without permission. Defendants admit to copying Alexander's tattoos in their
entirety in order to depict Orton in WWE 2K as he appears in real life (factual copying). However, citing Second and Fifth
Circuit decisions, they argue Alexander cannot establish legally actionable copying, which she must also prove.

Defendants’ argument is contrary to Seventh Circuit copyright law under which Alexander only needs to show that
Defendants used her property; the burden of proving the use was authorized falls squarely on Defendants. See Muhammad-
Ali v. Final Call, Inc., 832 F.3d 755 , 761 (7th Cir. 2016) (The burden is on the alleged infringer to show that the use was
authorized — not on the plaintiff to show it was not). It is undisputed that Alexander holds valid copyrights for the five tattoos
at issue and that Defendants copied her copyrighted works. Accordingly, Alexander's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
as to the copying element is GRANTED .

Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 141)

Because Defendants admit to copying Alexander's copyrighted tattoos, they are liable for copyright infringement unless they
can establish an affirmative defense to their usage. In that vein, Defendants assert three affirmative defenses to their
utilization of the tattoos. First, Defendants claim the use of the tattoos was authorized

[489 F.Supp.3d 820]

by an implied license. Next, they contend the use of the tattoos is protected by the fair use doctrine. Finally, Defendants
argue the use of the tattoos is de minimis.


--- Page 3 ---
Implied License

A copyright owner holds exclusive rights to copy or distribute copies of their work. 17 U.S.C. § 106 ; Final Call,_832 F.3d at
762 . The owner may authorize another person to do so through an exclusive written license, 17 U.S.C. § 101, ora

nonexclusive oral or implied license._/.A.E.. Inc. v. Shaver, 74 F.3d 768 , 775 (7th Cir. 1996). An implied nonexclusive
license does not transfer ownership of the copyright to the licensee. Final Call__832 F.3d at 762 . It merely permits the use of

a copyrighted work in a particular manner. /d. An implied license is created when ""(1) a person (the licensee) requests the
creation of a work, (2) the creator (the licensor) makes that particular work and delivers it to the licensee who requested it,

and (3) the licensor intends that the licensee-requestor copy and distribute her work."" /d. at 776 (citing_Effects Assocs., Inc.
v. Cohen , 908 F.2d 555 , 558 (9th Cir. 1990) ). A factfinder may look to objective evidence of the copyright owner's intent in
determining the existence of an implied license. /d.

According to Defendants, Alexander impliedly licensed Orton to disseminate and display the tattoos as part of his likeness.
They contend that Alexander created the tattoos at Orton's request and never told him that further use of the tattoos would
be infringement. Orton granted WWE the right to license his likeness to third parties and WWE then licensed Take-Two to
use Orton's likeness in the WWE 2k games. The first and second prongs of the analysis are not contested; the dispute
surrounds Alexander's intent and the scope of any implied license.

By Declaration, Orton states that he understood the tattoos were his personal expression and that Alexander never told him
he needed her permission any time his likeness would be shown with his tattoo visible. Alexander testified that she has
never given permission to any of her clients to use copies of her tattoo works in videogames and argues that Defendants
are conflating Orton's rights to his own likeness and right to appear in media with an implied license to use her copyrights in
unlimited and other commercial ways, such as in video games.

It is unclear whether Alexander and Orton discussed permissible forms of copying and distributing the tattoo works or
whether any implied license included sublicensing rights such that Orton could give permission for others to copy
Alexander's tattoo works. Thus, the evidence raises a triable issue of fact as to the existence and scope of an implied license
and Defendants’ motion is denied as to this affirmative defense.

Fair Use

The broad exclusive rights afforded copyright owners do not extend to certain forms of copying which are considered
indispensable to education, journalism, history, criticism, humor and other informative endeavors. The doctrine of fair use

encapsulates this category of permissible copying. 17 U.S.C. § 107 ; see also Kienitz v. Sconnie Nation LLC , 766 F.3d 756 ,
758 (7th Cir. 2014). Under the doctrine, using another's copyrighted work is ""fair"" for such purposes as ""criticism, comment,

news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research"" and is therefore ""not an infringement of copyright."" /d. ; Campbell v.
Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569 , 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) .

In determining whether the doctrine applies, courts consider the following non-exhaustive factors: (1) the purpose and
character of the use, including whether

[489 F.Supp.3d 821]

such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the
amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use

upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107 ; see Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy
Partners , 682 F.3d 687 , 692-93 (7th Cir. 2012). ""Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, which means that it may be
resolved on summary judgment if a reasonable trier of fact could reach only one conclusion--but not otherwise."" Ty, Inc. v.

Publ'ns Int'l, 292 F.3d 512 , 516 (7th Cir. 2002) (quoting Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises , 471 U.S. 539 ,
560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) )

The inquiry into the purpose and character of the use entails an examination of the extent to which the use is
complementary rather than merely substitutive of the original work and whether the use is for a nonprofit educational
purpose, as opposed to a commercial purpose. A use is appropriate or ""fair"" where a defendant changes a plaintiff's
copyrighted work or uses the work in a different context such that the plaintiff's work is transformed into a new creation.
Here, Defendants contend that Take Two's use of the copyrighted tattoos is ""transformative; that Alexander inked the tattoos
at Orton's request to reflect his personal expression whereas Defendants depicted the tattoos in WWE 2K to depict Orton
realistically. More specifically, relying on_Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605 , 607 (2d Cir. 2006),
they contend their use is transformative because the size of the tattoos are small and difficult to observe, the videogame is
an entire virtual world whereby the tattoos are an element utilized to create a ""fun, lush experience for game users,"" and the
tattoos are a tiny fraction of the videogames.

In Bill Graham , the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed summary judgment in favor of the defendant publishers of
Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip, a 480—page coffee table book that provides a history of the Grateful Dead through the
use of a timeline and over 2000 images. Bill Graham. 448 F.3d at 606 . The plaintiff claimed to own the copyright to seven

of the images which the defendants reproduced without permission. /d. at 607. The court concluded that the first factor
weighed in the defendants’ favor because their purpose in using the copyrighted image (as historical artifacts to document



--- Page 4 ---
the Grateful Dead concert events featured in the book's timeline) was plainly different from the plaintiff's dual purposes of
artistic expression and promotion — the images were originally used as concert posters to generate public interest in the
band's upcoming events. /d. at 609.

Unlike in Bill Graham, there is a factual dispute in this case as to Defendants’ purpose in using the tattoo works. Alexander
contends she created the tattoos for the purpose of displaying them on Orton's body and that Defendants used the tattoos
for the same purpose; to display them on Orton's body in the videogames. Alexander also disputes Defendants’
characterization of the size of the tattoos and maintains they are prominently displayed and clearly visible in the
videogames. These are material factual disputes.

The second factor focuses on the nature of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107(2). ""In general, the more creative the
work, the more protection it should be accorded from copying; correlatively, the more informational or functional the plaintiff's
work, the broader should be the scope of the fair use defense."" (internal quotation omitted).

[489 F.Supp.3d 822]

Neri v. Monroe , 2014 WL 793336, at *7 (W.D. Wis. Feb. 26, 2014) aff'd, 567 Fed.Appx. 465 (7th Cir. 2014). Defendants

argue the tattoos are not, or at best minimally, protected by copyright law. The Court disagrees. Alexander has a copyright
for five of Orton's tattoos. The art of creating a tattoo naturally entails creative and expressive efforts. Although Orton gave
Alexander direction and input as to the tattoos, it was Alexander's creativity and design choices that were ultimately inked.

The third factor involves consideration of the portion of the work used by the alleged infringers ""in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole"" in order to determine whether the portion used was reasonable given the purpose of copying. 17 U.S.C. §
107(3). See, Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586 —-87, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (""the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and
character of the use.""). Thus, the focus is not on how much of the work was taken, but the extent to which the protected
elements were copied from the original and whether that amount was needed to further the purpose of the use. Neri, 2014
WL 793336, at *7. Defendants assert that it was necessary to copy each tattoo in its entirety in order to depict real life
accurately. But Alexander argues that Defendants made no attempt to copy just those elements of the tattoo works
necessary to create the realism Defendants’ sought. Although wholesale copying does not preclude fair use per se, it
militates against a finding of fair use. Id. See also, Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp. , 336 F.3d 811 , 820 (9th Cir. 2003).

The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, ""requires courts to
consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether
unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant ... would result in a substantially adverse
impact on the potential market for the original."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . ""The ‘market’ in fair use cases
includes the potential market for not only the original work, but also derivative uses and licensing rights."" Red Label Music
PubI'g, Inc. v. Chila Productions , 388 F. Supp. 3d 975, 987 (N.D.IIl. 2019). Defendants argue that Alexander is attempting to
create a market in this case that has never existed before and would not be reasonable or likely to be developed — a market
for licensing tattoos. Alexander maintains that Defendants’ use will create a trend whereby other video game manufacturers,
and others similarly situated, take advantage of and fail to pay licensing fees for copyrighted works (above and beyond just
tattoos) unilaterally deemed necessary to create ""realism.""

Market harm is a matter of degree and the importance of this factor varies depending on the amount of harm and relative

strength of the showing on the other factors."" /d. at 590 n.21, 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Here, as previously noted, the remaining
factors do not weigh in favor of fair use as a matter of law. As such, Defendants’ fair use defense cannot be properly
resolved on summary judgment.

De Minimis Use

Defendants also argue that Alexander's copyright claim fails because Take-Two's use of the tattoos is de minimis. More

specifically, Defendants assert that Orton is one of many wrestlers in WWE 2K, that it is difficult to see his tattoos during the
videogame, and that the tattoos are a small percentage of the videogame data.

The de minimis defense, recognized in some circuits, protects a defendant from liability for technical copyright
[489 F.Supp.3d 823]

violations if the copying is ""so trivial as to fall below the quantitative threshold of substantial similarity, which is always a
required element of actionable copying."" See Ringgold v. Black Entertainment Television, Inc., 126 F.3d 70 , 77 (2d Cir.
1997). The qualitative component concerns the degree of similarity between the two works, focusing on ""whether an
average lay observe would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated form the copyrighted work."" Knitwaves,
Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd. (Inc.)_. 71 F.3d 996 , 1002 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted).
""The quantitative component generally concerns the amount of the copyrighted work that is copied, a consideration that is
especially pertinent to exact copying."" Ringgold, 126 F.3d at 75 (internal citation omitted).

Whether the Seventh Circuit recognizes this defense to copyright infringement claims is an open question. The parties cite
no Seventh Circuit decisions applying the defense and this Court is aware of none. Given the overlap between the defense


--- Page 5 ---
and actionable copying, which Alexander is not required to prove to sustain her case in this circuit, the Court doubts the
defense is viable generally. That said, the Court finds Defendants’ specific de minimis argument unavailing. The defense
has been successfully invoked to allow copying of a small and usually insignificant portion of the copyrighted works, not the
wholesale copying of works in their entirety as occurred here. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion is also denied as to this
affirmative defense.

Damages

""The Copyright Act permits a copyright owner to recover actual damages suffered as a result of the infringing activity and
any profits of the infringer resulting from the infringement that are not otherwise taken into account in calculating actual
damages."" Bell v. Taylor, 827 F.3d 699 , 709 (7th Cir. 2016) (quoting McRoberts Software, Inc. v. Media 100, Inc._ 329 F.3d
557 , 566 (7th Cir. 2003) ). Actual damages are ""usually determined by the loss in the fair market value of the copyright,

measured by the profits lost due to the infringement or by the value of the use of the copyrighted work to the infringer."" /d. A
jury may consider either a hypothetical lost license fee or the value of the infringing use to the infringer to determine actual

damages, provided the amount is not based on ""undue speculation."" /d. At minimum, the plaintiff must prove a causal
connection or nexus between the infringement and defendant's gross revenues. See Bell, 827 F.3d at 710 .

Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment because Alexander cannot show that she is entitled to actual
damages or Take-Two's profits. While Alexander testified that she was not aware of any business she lost due to the

depiction of the tattoos in WWE 2K, she may establish actual damages using either a hypothetical lost license fee or the
value of the infringing use to the infringer.

There is disputed evidence regarding the value of the copyright tattoo works to the videogames. Defendants argue the
evidence establishes that consumers do not purchase WWE 2K because of the tattoos. But other evidence shows that
consumers did purchase WWE 2K for its authenticity to the wrestlers’ appearance. In particular, Defendants admit that

consumer response is a consideration to their development of WWE 2K and the design choices made. They also
acknowledge that consumers expect there to be authenticity in the videogames and that WWE would have rejected Orton's
videogame persona if it appeared without his tattoos or appeared with tattoos that were different

[489 F.Supp.3d 824]

than Orton's actual tattoos. Additionally, Alexander's expert addresses the importance of authenticity to drive sales and
profits. Thus, an issue of material fact exists as to whether Alexander suffered actual damages based on the value of the
infringing use, defeating summary judgment.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

Synopsis

Background: Musician and entities holding rights to the
musical composition and sound recording of his song
sued political candidate and his campaign organization
for copyright infringement, alleging that defendants made
unauthorized use of musician's song by sharing on social
media, as part of candidate's re-election campaign, an
animated video created by a third party in which the song was
used. After the District Court, John G. Koeltl, J., 563 F. Supp.
3d 278, denied defendants' motion to dismiss, defendants
moved for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claim for
infringement of the sound recording's copyright, contending
that plaintiffs had not properly registered their copyright
in the sound recording, and plaintiffs moved for summary
judgment on liability, as to which the only disputed issue was
defendants' fair-use defense.

Holdings: The District Court, John G. Koeltl, J., held that:

he copyright in song's sound recording had been registered
with the Copyright Office when then-licensee registered, as
a sound recording, a compilation of musician's greatest hits
that included the song;

the first fair-use factor—the purpose and character of the
challenged use—favored plaintiffs;

the second fair-use factor—the nature of the copyrighted
work—favored plaintiffs;

WESTLAW

the third fair-use factor—the amount and substantiality of the
portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole—
favored plaintiffs; and

the fourth fair-use factor—the effect of the otherwise
infringing use on the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work—favored plaintiffs.

Defendants’ motion denied; plaintiffs’ motion granted.

Procedural Posture(s): Motion for Summary Judgment.

OPINION AND ORDER
JOHN G. KOELTL, District Judge:

*1 The plaintiffs, Eddy Grant (“Grant”); Greenheart
Music Limited, a United Kingdom Company (“Greenheart
UK”); and Greenheart Music Limited, an Antigua and
Barbuda Limited Company (“Greenheart Antigua”) brought
this copyright infringement action against former President
Donald J. Trump and Donald J. Trump For President, Inc.
(‘the Campaign”) (collectively, “the defendants”) for the
unauthorized use of Grant's music in an animated video
created by a third party during the 2020 presidential election
campaign and posted by former President Trump on his
personal Twitter account (“the Video”). See ECF No. 1.

The plaintiffs assert claims for copyright infringement of
the musical composition of “Electric Avenue” (Count I) and
copyright infringement of the sound recording of “Electric
Avenue” (Count II). See id.

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

In an Opinion and Order dated September 28, 2021, this Court
denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss. See Grant v. Trump,
563 F. Supp. 3d 278 (S.D.N.Y. 2021).

The parties have now filed cross-motions for partial summary
judgment. The defendants move for summary judgment
dismissing Count II of the complaint on the grounds that the
plaintiffs lack a valid copyright registration for the sound
recording of “Electric Avenue.” See Defs.’ Mot., ECF No.
100. The plaintiffs move for summary judgment on the issue
of liability. See Pls.” Mot., ECF No. 105. The Court heard oral
argument on the motion on September 6, 2024.

For the reasons explained below, the defendants’ motion
for partial summary judgment is denied, and the plaintiffs’
motion for partial summary judgment is granted.

The following facts are based on the parties’ Rule 56.1
statements, counterstatements, and supporting papers, and
are undisputed unless otherwise noted. The Court also
assumes familiarity with the Court's prior decision denying
the defendants’ motion to dismiss, including the extensive
description of the facts of this case. See Grant, 563 F. Supp.
3d at 282-83.

A.

Plaintiff Grant is the sole owner of Greenheart Antigua and
Greenheart UK, the licensing arm of Greenheart Antigua. See
Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Rule 56.1 Statement, 4] 6-8 (“Defs.’
Resp.”), ECF No. 115. Plaintiff Grant wrote, recorded, and
produced the 3-minute-48-second song entitled “Electric
Avenue.” See Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Rule 56.1 Statement { 1,
ECF No. 119 (“Pls.’ Resp.”).

In or about 1983, Grant assigned all of his rights and
interests in the musical composition (the “Composition”) and
sound recording (the “Recording”) of “Electric Avenue” to
Greenheart Antigua. Defs.’ Resp. §] 8. In February 1983, the
Composition was registered in the United States Copyright
Office under Registration Number PA0000164029. Id. | 5.

WESTLAW

The song was also released to the public in the United States
in or about 1983. Pls.’ Resp. j 4.

Pursuant to an agreement dated May 3, 2001, Greenheart UK
licensed the copyright in the Recording, among other works,
to Warner Music UK Limited (“Warner Music”) for a territory
including the United States for a period of five years from
the date of the first release of the Recording in the United
Kingdom. Defs.’ Resp. 4 11; see also Van Benthysen Decl.,
Ex. 4, ECF No. 103-3 (“Agreement”). The sound recording
of Electric Avenue was among the Recordings included in
a compilation entitled “Eddy Grant: The Greatest Hits” that
was covered by the Agreement. Agreement at 1, 12. The
Agreement provided, among other things, that Warner Music
was “exclusively entitled to exploit and publicly perform
the Recordings in the form of the Compilation ... for the
Rights Period throughout the Territory.” Agreement at § 1(f).
During the term of the Agreement, on March 22, 2002,
London Records, an affiliate of Warner Music, registered
the album “Eddy Grant: The Greatest Hits” containing the
Recording in the Copyright Office under registration number
SR0000344006. Defs.’ Resp. {| 12; Pls.’ Resp. 4 6; see also
Kasner Decl., Ex. C, ECF No. 101-3 (“Registration”).

*2 By September 20, 2006, the Agreement expired. Pls.’
Resp. 4 13. At that point, the copyright registration reverted
back to the plaintiffs. See id. The plaintiffs allege that
Greenheart Antigua has received considerable sums of money
licensing “Electric Avenue.” Defs.’ Resp. {J 13-14, 17.

B.

On August 12, 2020, Daniel Scavino, Director of Social
Media and Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications of the
Executive Office of the President, published a tweet to former
President Trump's Twitter account containing a 55-second
video in which the Recording, embodying the Composition,
can be heard starting at the 15-second mark and continuing
for the duration of the video. Id. 4] 19. Scavino testified that he
saw the Video on a Trump supporter's social media page either
on the same day or the day before he posted the Tweet. Id. 4
20. Scavino also testified that he spoke with former President
Trump before posting the Tweet and that former President
Trump “let [him] go with [his] instinct on it and post it.” Id.

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

Former President Trump testified that the Video was taken
from the internet and posted on Twitter. Id. 4 21.

The plaintiffs allege that the Video was a campaign video
attempting to denigrate the Democratic Party's 2020 nominee,
Current President Joseph Biden. Id. § 22. The Video
contains an animation of a high-speed red train bearing the
words “Trump Pence [Keep America Great] 2020,” in stark
contrast to a slow-moving handcar bearing the words “Biden
President: Your Hair Smells Terrific.” Id. The handcar is
powered by an animated likeness of President Biden, and
excerpts of President Biden's speeches and interviews are
played over the Recording. Id.

At the time, Trump's Twitter account had nearly 100 million
followers. Id. 4 35. According to Twitter, the Video has
been viewed more than 13.7 million times, and the Tweet
containing the Video has been “liked” more than 350,000
times and re-tweeted more than 139,000 times, and has
received close to 50,000 comments. Id. 4 36.

Cc.

By letter dated August 13, 2020, the plaintiffs, through their
counsel, demanded that the defendants cease and desist from
any further allegedly infringing conduct. Id. 4 37.

As of September 1, 2020, neither the Video nor the Tweet
containing the Video had been removed from Twitter. Id. 4
38. On September 1, 2020, the plaintiffs filed this action. ECF
No. 1.

IL.

The standard for granting summary judgment is well
established. “The court shall grant summary judgment if the
movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any
material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter

of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the
initial burden of “informing the district court of the basis for
its motion” and identifying the materials in the record that
“it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of
material fact.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323,
106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). At the summary

WESTLAW

judgment stage, the court must resolve all ambiguities and
draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party. See
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475
U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The
substantive law governing the case will identify those facts
that are material and, “[o]nly disputes over facts that might
affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will

properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.” Anderson
v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91
L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).

*3 When, as in this case, both parties seek summary
judgment, “the Court must assess each of the motions and
determine whether either party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law.” Ramos v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 447 F. Supp.
3d 153, 155 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).

Ill.

The defendants move for partial summary judgment
dismissing Count II, arguing that the plaintiffs never
registered the sound recording of “Electric Avenue.” See
Defs.’ Mot. at 1, ECF No. 100. The plaintiffs respond that the
Recording was registered when London Records registered
the sound recording of the compilation entitled “Eddy Grant:
The Greatest Hits” in 2002. See Pls.’ Opp'n at 1, ECF No. 118.

In order to establish a claim of copyright infringement, a
plaintiff must demonstrate (1) ownership of a valid copyright
and (2) unauthorized copying of the copyrighted work. See
Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony Records, 351 F.3d 46, 51 (2d Cir.
2003). In this case, there is no dispute that the defendants
used “Electric Avenue” without authorization, although the
defendants rely on the defense of “fair use.” That defense is
discussed below in connection with the plaintiffs’ motion for
summary judgment on liability.

However, the Copyright Act provides that “no civil action
for infringement of the copyright in any United States work
shall be instituted until ... registration of the copyright claim
has been made in accordance with [the Copyright Act].”
17 U.S.C. § 411(a). Therefore, “without a valid copyright
registration, a plaintiff cannot bring a viable copyright
infringement action.” Sohm v. Scholastic Inc., 959 F.3d 39, 53

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

Music, Inc. v. Nealy, 601 U.S. 366, 144 S.Ct. 1135, 218
L.Ed.2d 363 (2024).

The question in this case is whether the registration of the
album “Eddy Grant: The Greatest Hits” in 2002 also effected
the registration of the sound recording of “Electric Avenue”
that was contained in that album.

A.

Courts in this Circuit have held that the registration of a

“collective” or “derivative” work~ covers registration of the

constituent parts if the registrant has copyright ownership of

the constituent parts. 3

*4 For example, the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit found in Morris v. Bus. Concepts, Inc. that a publisher
that filed collective works copyright registrations for issues
of its magazine would have thereby obtained copyright
registration for a journalist's articles contained in the issues if

the publisher owned the copyright for those articles. See 259
F.3d 65, 69-72 (2d Cir. 2001), as clarified on denial of reh'g,
283 F.3d 502 (2d Cir. 2002), abrogated on other grounds, Reed
Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154, 130 S.Ct. 1237, 176
L.Ed.2d 18 (2010).

And in Streetwise Maps, Inc. v. VanDam, Inc., the Court of
Appeals held that a registration certificate for a derivative
Streetwise Manhattan map permitted the copyright owner to
maintain an action for infringement of an earlier Streetwise

Manhattan map that was included in the derivative maps. 159
F.3d 739, 746-47 (2d Cir. 1998).

The Court of Appeals explained:

because Streetwise is the owner of
the copyright of both the derivative
and pre-existing work, the registration
certificate relating to the derivative
work in this circumstance will
suffice to permit it to maintain an
action for infringement based on
defendants’ infringement of the pre-

existing work. That plaintiff need

WESTLAW

not produce a separate registration
relating to the pre-existing work is
a proposition which finds support
in other courts and in the writings
of scholarly commentators. See, e.g.,
Greenwich Film Prods., S.A. v. DRG
Records, Inc., 833 F. Supp. 248,
251-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (copyright
registration

of derivative work
sufficient for copyright infringement
action based on pre-existing work
where plaintiff owned the copyrights
for both the derivative and pre-existing
work); 2 Melville B. Nimmer & David
Nimmer, Nimmer_on Copyright §
7.16[B][2] (1997) (copyright owners
of derivative work that own pre-
existing work should be able to
pursue copyright infringement action
against individuals infringing the
pre-existing work, even when only
derivative work [is] registered); see
also Woods v. Universal City Studios.
Inc., 920 F. Supp. 62, 64 (S.D.N.Y.

1996) (registration of copyright for

collective work satisfies requirements
of 17 US.C. § 411(a) to bring
copyright infringement action based
on constituent parts where owner of
copyright for collective work also
owns constituent parts).

Streetwise Maps, 159 F.3d at 747; see_also Sylvestre _v.
Oswald, No. 91 CIV 5060, 1993 WL 179101, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.
May 18, 1993) (finding that the registration of a fifteen-
song cassette tape established a valid registration for a song
contained in the cassette).

Nimmer on Copyright, an authoritative treatise on copyrights,
also supports the conclusion that a valid registration for a
collection is a sufficient registration for a constituent part so
long as the copyright holder for the collection also holds the
copyright for the constituent part at issue:


--- Page 5 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

{If] the copyright owner of the
derivative or collective work ... is
itself also the copyright owner [of the
pre-existing work,] ... validating the
registration solely of the derivative
or collective work [would seem]
sufficient to permit maintenance of
an infringement action [for the pre-
existing work] .... At least one court
reached that result based on the
language of the 1909 Act. [See
Rexnord, Inc. v. Mod. Handling
Sys., Inc., 379 F. Supp. 1190 (D.
Del. 1974).] Although there is no
comparable language in the current
Act, the same rule should be followed.
As the Fourth Circuit puts it, when
the same party owns the derivative
or collective work plus the underlying
elements incorporated therein, its
registration of the former is sufficient

to permit an infringement action on
the underlying parts, whether they
be new or preexisting. [See Xoom,
Inc. _v. Imageline, Inc., 323 F.3d
279, 284 (4th Cir. 2003), abrogated
on_other grounds, Reed_ Elsevier,
Inc. _v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154,
130 S.Ct. 1237, 176 L.Ed.2d 18
(2010), although Nimmer notes an
inconsistent footnote.] That rule is

consistent moreover with the current
provision [17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1)] that,
for the purpose of computing statutory
damages, all the parts of a compilation
or derivative work constitute one
work.

*5 2 Melville B. Nimmer and David Nimmer, Nimmer on
Copyright § 7.16[B][5][c] (Matthew Bender, Rev. Ed. 2024).
In this case, London Records registered “Eddy Grant: The
Greatest Hits” in 2002. See Defs.’ Resp. §] 12; Pls.’ Resp.

WESTLAW

4] 6; see _also Registration at 1. “Eddy Grant: The Greatest
Hits” undisputedly contains the sound recording of “Electric
Avenue.” See Agreement at 12. At the time of the registration
on March 22, 2002, London Records, as an affiliate of Warner
Music, was a licensee with all rights in the sound recording
of “Electric Avenue.” See id. at | (“[Greenheart UK] hereby
grant[s] to [Warner Music] the license of the full copyright
in the Recordings for the period of five (5) years from the
date of the first release of the Single “Electric Avenue” in the
UK ....”). The Agreement also provided that Warner Music
was “exclusively entitled to exploit and publicly perform the
Recordings [including Electric Avenue] in the form of the
Compilation ... for the Rights Period throughout the territory.”
Agreement § 1(f). Accordingly, the 2002 registration of
“Eddy Grant: The Greatest Hits” also registered the sound
recording of “Electric Avenue.” When the Agreement expired
by its terms no later than September 20, 2006, see Defs.’ Resp.
4] 13, the copyright ownership of the Recording reverted back
to the plaintiffs.

B.

In their papers, the defendants argued that the Registration
itself did not cover “Electric Avenue.”

“{IJn general, the nature of authorship defines the scope of
the registration ....” Ward v. Barnes & Noble, Inc., 93 F.
Supp. 3d 193, 204 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). “Minor mistakes in a
registration statement, made in good faith and unaccompanied
by deceptive intent, will not serve to invalidate registration.”
Greenwich Film Prods., 833 F. Supp. at 252 (citing Gund, Inc.
vy. Swank, Inc., 673 F.Supp. 1233, 1273 (S.D.N.Y. 1987)).

The defendants argue that the Registration does not cover the
sound recording of “Electric Avenue” because the plaintiffs
conceded in the “authorship” field that the Registration is for
a “compilation.” See Defs.’ Reply at 2. However, as explained
above, registration of a compilation may nevertheless be
sufficient to register a constituent work.

The defendants also argue that the Registration explicitly
“disclaimed” registration of certain “preexisting” recordings.
See id. However, the Registration does not “disclaim” any
registration. Rather, as plaintiffs’ counsel explained, the
Registration did not seek to register a copyright for any work


--- Page 6 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

that was previously copyrighted and the sound recording of
Electric Avenue was not previously registered. Given the
lenient nature of the registration requirement, see Sylvestre,
1993 WL 179101, at *2, the registration should not be
construed to exclude previously published but unregistered
works.

Accordingly, the registration of “Eddy Grant: The Greatest
Hits” in 2002 effected the registration of the sound recording
of “Electric Avenue” that was contained in that compilation.

Cc.

The defendants argue that the registration for a collective
work does not include the registration for any previously
published part but have failed to point to any case that
supports that proposition.

*6 The defendants cite to the Compendium and other
Copyright Office documents to argue that, for the registration
of a collective or derivative work to cover the constituent
parts, the constituent parts must have previously been
unpublished at the time of registration. See Defs.’ Mot. at
9-10.

As an initial matter, Copyright Office documents are not
binding on courts but are owed deference to the extent they
are persuasive. See, e.g., EMI Christian Music Grp., Inc. v.
MP3tunes, LLC, 844 F.3d 79, 97 (2d Cir. 2016).

Courts in the Second Circuit have not interpreted copyright
laws to require that constituent parts must have been
unpublished at the time of the registration of the collective
or derivative work. In Streetwise Maps, the constituent work
—the Streetwise Manhattan map from 1984 or 1985—was
clearly published before the registration of the derivative
work in 1989. See 159 F.3d at 747-78. The fact that
the constituent work had been published previously was
irrelevant. Furthermore, in Woods, the court found that the
registration of a collection was sufficient registration for a
drawing that had been published previously. See 920 F. Supp.
at 64.

While the Compendium does provide that “[a]n applicant
may register a collective work together with the separate

WESTLAW

and independent works contained therein ... if the component
works have not been previously published,” Compendium §
509.1 (regarding collective works), this provision appears to
reflect only the Copyright Office's policy-based preference
for separate registrations where possible. The Compendium
also provides that “[iJf a collective work contains an
appreciable amount of [previously published material], the
applicant generally should limit the claim to the new material
that the author contributed to the work and the [previously
published] material should be excluded from the claim.” Id.
§ 509.2 (emphasis added).

The defendants quote the Compendium to say that “a
registration for a compilation does not cover any previously
published material ....”. Compendium § 508.2. However,
that quote appears between citations to Feist Publications.
Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 111
S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991), and the Compendium's
warning that “[t]he data, facts, or other uncopyrightable
material that appears in a compilation is not protected by the
copyright in that work” and “that the copyright in a factual
compilation is thin.” Compendium § 508.2. Therefore, the

reference to “previously published material” in section 508.2
of the Compendium likely refers to data or facts published
in a compilation like a phonebook, where the previously
published material is factual material that is not able to be
copyrighted. That type of material is distinguishable from the
prior recording in this case.

Accordingly, the defendants’ argument that “Electric
Avenue” must have been unpublished at the time of the
registration of “Eddy Grant: The Greatest Hits” is not

persuasive.

In short, the Agreement gave London Records the right to
register the copyright on the Compilation that included the
sound recording of Electric Avenue. London Records filed
that registration and there is nothing in the registration or
the law that precluded the application of that registration
to the sound recording of Electric Avenue. Therefore, the
defendants’ motion for summary judgment dismissing the
claim for copyright infringement of the recording of Electric
Avenue (Count II) is denied.

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

Iv.

*7 The plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment,
finding the defendants liable for copyright infringement.
They argue that the only defense to liability is fair use,
and that there are no issues of material fact and that the
fair use defense does not apply in this case. See Pls.’
Mot. at 13-14. There is no dispute that the composition
and the sound recording of the musical performance for
“Electric Avenue” were used without permission and that
the Composition was copyrighted. See Defs.’ Opp'n at 3, 6,
ECF No. 114. As discussed above, the plaintiffs also hold a
valid copyright registration covering the sound recording of
“Electric Avenue.” The only defense that the defendants raise
is that the Video's use of “Electric Avenue” was a fair use. See
id. at 6. Therefore, the only bar to a finding of liability by the
defendants for copyright infringement as alleged in Counts I
and II of the Complaint is the defense of fair use.

Pursuant to the Copyright Act of 1976, fair use is a complete
defense to a claim of copyright infringement. See 17 U.S.C. §
107. “The fair-use doctrine seeks to strike a balance between
an artist's intellectual property rights to the fruits of her own
creative labor, including the right to license and develop (or
refrain from licensing or developing) derivative works based
on that creative labor, and the ability of other authors, artists,
and the rest of us to express them—or ourselves by reference
to the works of others.” Andy Warhol Found. for Visual Arts

Inc. v. Goldsmith, 11 F.4th 26, 36 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting
Blanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d 244, 250 (2d Cir. 2006)), aff'd 598
U.S. 508, 143 S.Ct. 1258, 215 L.Ed.2d 473 (2023).

The Copyright Act provides a non-exhaustive list of four
factors that courts are to consider in making a fair use
determination:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether
such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work.

WESTLAW

17 U.S.C. § 107. “The Act's fair use provision ... sets forth
general principles, the application of which requires judicial
balancing, depending upon relevant circumstances.” Andy
Warhol Found., 598 U.S. at 527, 143 S.Ct. 1258 (quoting
Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc., 593 U.S. 1, 19, 141 S.Ct.
1183, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021)). “[I]n applying the fair use
provision, copyright's protection may be stronger where the
copyrighted material serves an artistic rather than a utilitarian

function.” Id.

“[F]air use is an affirmative defense, and [the defendants]
bear[ ] the burden to justify its taking of [the plaintiffs]
work ....” Id. at 547 n.21, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

A.

The first fair use factor concerns “the purpose and character
of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes[.]” 17 U.S.C.
§ 107(1).

“The central question [the first factor] asks is whether the new
work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation
(supplanting the original), or instead adds something new,
with a further purpose or different character.” Andy Warhol
Found., 598 U.S. at 528, 143 S.Ct. 1258 (quoting Campbell v.
Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164,
127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)).

The “purposes” listed in the preamble paragraph of § 107
—such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,
scholarship, or research—treflect the sorts of copying that
courts most commonly have found to be fair uses and so
may guide the first fair use factor inquiry. See id. (quoting
17 U.S.C. § 107; Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577-78, 114 S.Ct.
1164). These purposes ordinarily do not supersede the objects
of, or supplant, the work; rather, they use the work to serve a
distinct end. See id. In other words, “a use may be justified
because copying is reasonably necessary to achieve the user's
new purpose.” Id. at 532, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

The question is one of “to what extent” because many
secondary works add something new. See id. at 528-29, 143
S.Ct. 1258. “The larger the difference, the more likely the first
factor weighs in favor of fair use.” Id. at 529, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

“A use that has a further purpose or different character is said
to be transformative[,] [and] transformativeness is a matter
of degree.” Id. (citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164).

*8 In this case, the Video has a very low degree of
“transformativeness,” if any at all. As this Court found in
denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss, the Video “is best
described as a wholesale copying of music to accompany
a political campaign ad.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 285.
“[T]he video's creator did not edit the song's lyrics, vocals, or
instrumentals at all, and the song is immediately recognizable
when it begins playing around the fifteen-second mark of the
video, notwithstanding that audio of President Biden's speech
can be heard simultaneously.” Id. “Moreover, the animation
does not use Electric Avenue as a vehicle to deliver its satirical
message, and it makes no effort to poke fun at the song or
Grant.” Id. “[T]he song—which plays for over two-thirds
of the duration of the video—is a major component of the
impression created by the animation, even though it appears
that the video's creator could have chosen nearly any other
music to serve the same entertaining purpose.” Id. at 286.
“[A]Jnd the defendants have offered no justification for their
extensive borrowing.” Id. at 285.

The defendants once again rely on Brown v. Netflix, Inc.,
462 F. Supp. 3d 453 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), affid, 855 F. App'x
61 (2d Cir. 2021), to argue that an unaltered secondary use

may nevertheless be transformative. See Defs.’ Opp'n at 10.
However, as this Court has already held, the use in this case
“is different in magnitude and kind [from that in Brown]:
the song plays for more than two-thirds of the animation
and plays no discernible role in communicating the video's
overarching political commentary.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d
at 286. In Brown, “the excerpt of the song was situated
within a performance about which the documentary was
commenting, ... the song could be heard only briefly and
in passing[,] ... [and] the content of the song substantively
contributed to the burlesque act.” Id. (citing 462 F. Supp. 3d
at 458).

The defendants also argue that the Video “transformed Grant's
original conception of Electric Avenue as a protest against
social conditions into a colorful attack on the character
and personality traits of a rival political figure.” See Defs.’
Opp'nat 11. Again, “the defendants’ argument misapprehends
the focus of the transformative use inquiry.” Grant, 563 F.

WESTLAW

Supp. 3d at 284. “While it is true that the animation is
partisan political commentary and the song apparently is
not, the inquiry does not focus exclusively on the character
of the animation; rather, it focuses on the character of
the animation's use of Grant's song.” Id. “[T]he video's
overarching political purpose does not automatically render
its use of any non-political work transformative.” Id. at 285
(citing Henley v. DeVore, 733 F. Supp. 2d 1144, 1164 (C.D.
Cal. 2010); Browne v. McCain, 612 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1129-31
(C.D. Cal. 2009)). In Andy Warhol Foundation, the Supreme
Court “rejected the idea that any secondary work that adds
a new aesthetic or new expression to its source material is
necessarily transformative.” 598 U.S. at 543, 143 S.Ct. 1258.
To so hold “would swallow the copyright owner's exclusive
right to prepare derivative works.” Id. at 541, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

In assessing the first fair use factor, the Court must
also consider whether the allegedly infringing use is
of a commercial nature. See id. at 531, 143 S.Ct.
1258. Commercialism too, is not dispositive; “[t]he more
transformative the new work, the less will be the significance
of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against
a finding of fair use[.]” Id. (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at
579, 114S.Ct. 1164).

The question of whether the work is commercial “is not
whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but
whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the
copyrighted material without paying the customary price.”
Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S.
539, 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985); see also
Andy Warhol Found., 598 U.S. at 537, 143 S.Ct. 1258
(quoting Harper). “Monetary gain is not the sole criterion,”

especially in settings where “profit is ill-measured in dollars.”
Weissmann v. Freeman, 868 F.2d 1313, 1324 (2d Cir. 1989).
In this case, the defendants benefited commercially from
using Electric Avenue without paying a licensing fee.

*9 As this Court found in deciding the motion to dismiss,
“there is a well-established market for music licensing,
[and] the defendants sought to gain an advantage by using
Grant's popular song without paying Grant the customary
licensing fee.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 287. Therefore,
“the possibility of commercial advantage [could not] be
excluded at th[at] point[.]” Id. Since then, the defendants have
not presented any evidence to suggest that the Video's use
was not commercial in nature. Rather, the defendants argue


--- Page 9 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

that the use of the song “did not give the Defendants any
commercial advantage” because the Video was created by an
unaffiliated third-party, and the plaintiffs have pointed to no
evidence that the Trump campaign received any donations
as a result of the Tweet containing the Video. Defs.’ Opp'n
at 10-11 (distinguishing Henley). However, monetary gain,
such as campaign contributions, is not required to show that
the use was commercial. See, e.g., Weissmann, 868 F.2d at
1324 (“[W)]hat is valuable is recognition because it so often
influences professional advancement and academic tenure.”’).

The defendants also argue that the plaintiffs “have never
licensed the Song for political use, and have strongly
indicated that they have no interest of doing so in the future[.]”
Defs.’ Opp'n at 11. But as the Court previously held, “[i]t is
plain that widespread, uncompensated use of Grant's music
in promotional videos—political or otherwise—would ...
undermine Grant's ability to obtain compensation in exchange
for licensing his music.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 289.

It is surely true that the use of the copyrighted material
has fewer aspects of a “commercial nature” because it is
not used for profit, but the lack of a profit motive is
insufficient to overcome the lack of a “transformative use”
for purposes of the first fair use factor. See Hachette Book
Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive, No. 23-1260, —— F.4th ——,
——,, 2024 WL 4031751, at *12 (2d Cir. Sept. 4, 2024)
(transformativeness remains the ‘central’ focus of the first

factor’).

Accordingly, the first fair use factor favors the plaintiffs.

B.

The second fair use factor “directs courts to consider the
nature of the copyrighted work, including (1) whether it is
expressive or creative or more factual, with a greater leeway
being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work is factual
or informational, and (2) whether the work is published or
unpublished, with the scope of fair use involving unpublished
works being considerably narrower.” Andy Warhol Found.,
11 F4th at 45 (quoting Blanch, 467 F.3d at 256).

As the Court previously found, “[a]s to the first consideration,
it is clear that Electric Avenue is a creative work and therefore

WESTLAW

is closer to the core of intended copyright protection.” Grant,
563 F. Supp. 3d at 287-88 (citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at
586, 114 S.Ct. 1164; Henley, 733 F. Supp. 2d at 1160). The
defendants “concede that [Electric Avenue] is a creative and
published work, and therefore the second fair use factor favors
Plaintiffs.” Defs.’ Opp'n at 14.

Accordingly, the second factor, although “assigned limited
weight in the overall fair use determination[,]” Grant, 563 F.
Supp. 3d at 288 (citing Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804
F.3d 202, 220 (2d Cir. 2015)), favors the plaintiffs.

Cc.

The third fair use factor considers “the amount and
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). “In assessing this
factor, [the court] consider[s] not only the quantity of the
materials used but also their quality and importance in relation
to the original work.” Andy Warhol Found., 11 F.4th at 45—
46 (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 587, 114 S.Ct. 1164).

As this Court found in its decision denying the defendants’
motion to dismiss, “[t]he song plays for the majority of the
animation; the excerpt is of central importance to the original
work; and the defendants have not articulated any purpose for
the copying.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 288. The defendants
“likewise concede that because the length of the excerpted
portion of [Electric Avenue] and the percentage of time that
it takes up in the Video are undisputed, there is no issue of
material fact as to [the third fair use factor].” Defs.’ Opp'n at
14.

*10 Accordingly, this factor also favors the plaintiffs.

D.

The fourth and final fair use factor asks “whether, if the
challenged use becomes widespread, it will adversely affect
the potential market for the copyrighted work. Analysis of this
factor requires [the court] to balance the benefit the public
will derive if the use is permitted and the personal gain the
copyright owner will receive if the use is denied.” Andy
Warhol Found., 11 F.4th at 48 (quoting Bill Graham Archives


--- Page 10 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605, 613 (2d Cir. 2006);
Wright v. Warner Books, Inc., 953 F.2d 731, 739 (2d Cir.
1991)). “This analysis embraces both the primary market for
the work and any derivative markets that exist or that its
author might reasonably license others to develop, regardless
of whether the particular author claiming infringement has
elected to develop such markets.” Id. (citing Salinger v.
Colting, 607 F.3d 68, 74, 83 (2d Cir. 2010)). In other words,
the issue “is not solely whether the secondary work harms
an existing market for the specific work alleged to have
been infringed. Rather, [the court] must also consider whether
unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in
by [the defendants] would result in a substantially adverse

impact on the potential market[.]” Id. at 49 (citing Campbell,
510 USS. at 590, 114 S.Ct. 1164).

In this case, there is no public benefit as a result of the
defendants’ use of “Electric Avenue.” As the plaintiffs
correctly argue, the defendants “could have used any song,
created a new song, or used no song at all, to convey the
same political message in the Infringing Video.” Pls.’ Reply
at 5, ECF No. 121. And as the Court previously found, while
“political speech ... is a rich part of our First Amendment
tradition[,] ... denying the defendants’ fair use defense in this
case ... will not chill legitimate political satire.” Grant, 563
F. Supp. 3d at 289. Even after discovery in this case, the
defendants provide no evidence of public benefit. See Defs.”
Opp'n at 11-14.

There is, however, evidence that if the challenged use
becomes widespread, it will adversely affect the potential
market for “Electric Avenue.” As this Court held, “[iJt
is plain that widespread, uncompensated use of Grant's
music in promotional videos—political or otherwise—would
embolden would-be infringers and undermine Grant's ability
to obtain compensation in exchange for licensing his music.”
Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 289.

The defendants claim that the plaintiffs “have [since] admitted
that the Video has not impaired their ability to exploit
the markets to which they have traditionally licensed the
Song.” Defs.’ Opp'n at 14. To the contrary, the plaintiffs
have submitted evidence, see Grant Decl., Exs. 8-10, ECF
No. 107-8—107-10, “that widespread, uncompensated use of
Grant's music in promotional videos—political or otherwise
—would embolden would-be infringers and undermine

WESTLAW

Grant's ability to obtain compensation in exchange for
licensing his music.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 289. Moreover,
it is the defendants’ burden to show that there is no genuine
issue of material fact that the plaintiffs were not harmed, see
id. at 284, and the defendants have made no such showing.

*11 The defendants also argue that the plaintiffs “have
previously shown no interest in licensing the Song for
political use, and have strongly indicated that they have no
interest in doing so in the future[.]” Defs.’ Opp'n at 14.
However, the definition of “potential markets” is not so
narrow; it includes any markets that “creators of original
works would in general develop or license others to develop.”
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 592, 114 S.Ct. 1164. The plaintiffs’
ability to license “Electric Avenue” in the market for licensed
music for videos—political or otherwise—would be affected
by widespread, uncompensated use.

Accordingly, the last fair use factor favors the plaintiffs.

In summary, the Court has applied the fair use factors and
finds that each factor favors the plaintiffs. Therefore, the
plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment dismissing
the defendants’ defense of fair use is granted. Because the
defendants have asserted no further defense, the plaintiffs
are entitled to summary judgment on liability for copyright
infringement against the defendants.

CONCLUSION

The Court has considered all of the parties’ arguments. To
the extent not specifically addressed above, those arguments
are either moot or without merit. For the reasons explained
above, the defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment
dismissing Count II is denied. The plaintiffs’ motion for
summary judgment dismissing the defendants’ “fair use”
defense is granted, and the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment
on liability.

“A derivative work is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, ... in which a work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted.” 17 U.S.C. § 101. “A collective work is a work ... in which a number of contributions,
constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.” Id. “A
compilation is a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are
selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original
work of authorship. The term compilation includes collective works.” Id. The plaintiffs argue that “Eddy Grant:
The Greatest Hits” is a derivative and collective work, as well as a compilation. See Pls.’ Opp'n at 5-6, ECF

fail to provide any reasoning for this argument. See Defs.’ Reply at 3-4, ECF No. 124.

This principle is distinguishable from cases where the copyright owner of the collective or derivative work does
not have copyright ownership over the constituent parts because the constituent parts are not copyrightable.

Synopsis

Background: Musician and entities holding rights to the
musical composition and sound recording of his song
sued political candidate and his campaign organization
for copyright infringement, alleging that defendants made
unauthorized use of musician's song by sharing on social
media, as part of candidate's re-election campaign, an
animated video created by a third party in which the song was
used. After the District Court, John G. Koeltl, J., 563 F. Supp.
3d 278, denied defendants' motion to dismiss, defendants
moved for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claim for
infringement of the sound recording's copyright, contending
that plaintiffs had not properly registered their copyright
in the sound recording, and plaintiffs moved for summary
judgment on liability, as to which the only disputed issue was
defendants' fair-use defense.

Holdings: The District Court, John G. Koeltl, J., held that:

he copyright in song's sound recording had been registered
with the Copyright Office when then-licensee registered, as
a sound recording, a compilation of musician's greatest hits
that included the song;

the first fair-use factor—the purpose and character of the
challenged use—favored plaintiffs;

the second fair-use factor—the nature of the copyrighted
work—favored plaintiffs;

WESTLAW

the third fair-use factor—the amount and substantiality of the
portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole—
favored plaintiffs; and

the fourth fair-use factor—the effect of the otherwise
infringing use on the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work—favored plaintiffs.

Defendants’ motion denied; plaintiffs’ motion granted.

OPINION AND ORDER
JOHN G. KOELTL, District Judge:

*1 The plaintiffs, Eddy Grant (“Grant”); Greenheart
Music Limited, a United Kingdom Company (“Greenheart
UK”); and Greenheart Music Limited, an Antigua and
Barbuda Limited Company (“Greenheart Antigua”) brought
this copyright infringement action against former President
Donald J. Trump and Donald J. Trump For President, Inc.
(‘the Campaign”) (collectively, “the defendants”) for the
unauthorized use of Grant's music in an animated video
created by a third party during the 2020 presidential election
campaign and posted by former President Trump on his
personal Twitter account (“the Video”). See ECF No. 1.

The plaintiffs assert claims for copyright infringement of
the musical composition of “Electric Avenue” (Count I) and
copyright infringement of the sound recording of “Electric
Avenue” (Count II). See id.

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

In an Opinion and Order dated September 28, 2021, this Court
denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss. See Grant v. Trump,
563 F. Supp. 3d 278 (S.D.N.Y. 2021).

The parties have now filed cross-motions for partial summary
judgment. The defendants move for summary judgment
dismissing Count II of the complaint on the grounds that the
plaintiffs lack a valid copyright registration for the sound
recording of “Electric Avenue.” See Defs.’ Mot., ECF No.
100. The plaintiffs move for summary judgment on the issue
of liability. See Pls.” Mot., ECF No. 105. The Court heard oral
argument on the motion on September 6, 2024.

For the reasons explained below, the defendants’ motion
for partial summary judgment is denied, and the plaintiffs’
motion for partial summary judgment is granted.

The following facts are based on the parties’ Rule 56.1
statements, counterstatements, and supporting papers, and
are undisputed unless otherwise noted. The Court also
assumes familiarity with the Court's prior decision denying
the defendants’ motion to dismiss, including the extensive
description of the facts of this case. See Grant, 563 F. Supp.
3d at 282-83.

A.

Plaintiff Grant is the sole owner of Greenheart Antigua and
Greenheart UK, the licensing arm of Greenheart Antigua. See
Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Rule 56.1 Statement, 4] 6-8 (“Defs.’
Resp.”), ECF No. 115. Plaintiff Grant wrote, recorded, and
produced the 3-minute-48-second song entitled “Electric
Avenue.” See Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Rule 56.1 Statement { 1,
ECF No. 119 (“Pls.’ Resp.”).

In or about 1983, Grant assigned all of his rights and
interests in the musical composition (the “Composition”) and
sound recording (the “Recording”) of “Electric Avenue” to
Greenheart Antigua. Defs.’ Resp. §] 8. In February 1983, the
Composition was registered in the United States Copyright
Office under Registration Number PA0000164029. Id. | 5.

WESTLAW

The song was also released to the public in the United States
in or about 1983. Pls.’ Resp. j 4.

Pursuant to an agreement dated May 3, 2001, Greenheart UK
licensed the copyright in the Recording, among other works,
to Warner Music UK Limited (“Warner Music”) for a territory
including the United States for a period of five years from
the date of the first release of the Recording in the United
Kingdom. Defs.’ Resp. 4 11; see also Van Benthysen Decl.,
Ex. 4, ECF No. 103-3 (“Agreement”). The sound recording
of Electric Avenue was among the Recordings included in
a compilation entitled “Eddy Grant: The Greatest Hits” that
was covered by the Agreement. Agreement at 1, 12. The
Agreement provided, among other things, that Warner Music
was “exclusively entitled to exploit and publicly perform
the Recordings in the form of the Compilation ... for the
Rights Period throughout the Territory.” Agreement at § 1(f).
During the term of the Agreement, on March 22, 2002,
London Records, an affiliate of Warner Music, registered

On August 12, 2020, Daniel Scavino, Director of Social
Media and Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications of the
Executive Office of the President, published a tweet to former
President Trump's Twitter account containing a 55-second
video in which the Recording, embodying the Composition,
can be heard starting at the 15-second mark and continuing
for the duration of the video. Id. 4] 19. Scavino testified that he
saw the Video on a Trump supporter's social media page either
on the same day or the day before he posted the Tweet. Id. 4
20. Scavino also testified that he spoke with former President
Trump before posting the Tweet and that former President
Trump “let [him] go with [his] instinct on it and post it.” Id.

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

Former President Trump testified that the Video was taken
from the internet and posted on Twitter. Id. 4 21.

The plaintiffs allege that the Video was a campaign video
attempting to denigrate the Democratic Party's 2020 nominee,
Current President Joseph Biden. Id. § 22. The Video
contains an animation of a high-speed red train bearing the
words “Trump Pence [Keep America Great] 2020,” in stark
contrast to a slow-moving handcar bearing the words “Biden
President: Your Hair Smells Terrific.” Id. The handcar is
powered by an animated likeness of President Biden, and
excerpts of President Biden's speeches and interviews are
played over the Recording. Id.

At the time, Trump's Twitter account had nearly 100 million
followers. Id. 4 35. According to Twitter, the Video has
been viewed more than 13.7 million times, and the Tweet
containing the Video has been “liked” more than 350,000
times and re-tweeted more than 139,000 times, and has
received close to 50,000 comments. Id. 4 36.

Cc.

By letter dated August 13, 2020, the plaintiffs, through their
counsel, demanded that the defendants cease and desist from
any further allegedly infringing conduct. Id. 4 37.

As of September 1, 2020, neither the Video nor the Tweet
containing the Video had been removed from Twitter. Id. 4
38. On September 1, 2020, the plaintiffs filed this action. ECF
No. 1.

The standard for granting summary judgment is well
established. “The court shall grant summary judgment if the
movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any
material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter

of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the
initial burden of “informing the district court of the basis for
its motion” and identifying the materials in the record that
“it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of
material fact.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323,
106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). At the summary

WESTLAW

judgment stage, the court must resolve all ambiguities and
draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party. See
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475
U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The
substantive law governing the case will identify those facts
that are material and, “[o]nly disputes over facts that might
affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will

properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.” Anderson
v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91
L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).

*3 When, as in this case, both parties seek summary
judgment, “the Court must assess each of the motions and
determine whether either party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law.” Ramos v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 447 F. Supp.
3d 153, 155 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).

Ill.

The defendants move for partial summary judgment
dismissing Count II, arguing that the plaintiffs never
registered the sound recording of “Electric Avenue.” See
Defs.’ Mot. at 1, ECF No. 100. The plaintiffs respond that the
Recording was registered when London Records registered
the sound recording of the compilation entitled “Eddy Grant:
The Greatest Hits” in 2002. See Pls.’ Opp'n at 1, ECF No. 118.

In order to establish a claim of copyright infringement, a
plaintiff must demonstrate (1) ownership of a valid copyright
and (2) unauthorized copying of the copyrighted work. See
Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony Records, 351 F.3d 46, 51 (2d Cir.
2003). In this case, there is no dispute that the defendants
used “Electric Avenue” without authorization, although the
defendants rely on the defense of “fair use.” That defense is
discussed below in connection with the plaintiffs’ motion for
summary judgment on liability.

However, the Copyright Act provides that “no civil action
for infringement of the copyright in any United States work
shall be instituted until ... registration of the copyright claim
has been made in accordance with [the Copyright Act].”
17 U.S.C. § 411(a). Therefore, “without a valid copyright
registration, a plaintiff cannot bring a viable copyright
infringement action.” Sohm v. Scholastic Inc., 959 F.3d 39, 53

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

Music, Inc. v. Nealy, 601 U.S. 366, 144 S.Ct. 1135, 218
L.Ed.2d 363 (2024).

The question in this case is whether the registration of the
album “Eddy Grant: The Greatest Hits” in 2002 also effected
the registration of the sound recording of “Electric Avenue”
that was contained in that album.

A.

Courts in this Circuit have held that the registration of a

“collective” or “derivative” work~ covers registration of the

constituent parts if the registrant has copyright ownership of

the constituent parts. 3

*4 For example, the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit found in Morris v. Bus. Concepts, Inc. that a publisher
that filed collective works copyright registrations for issues
of its magazine would have thereby obtained copyright
registration for a journalist's articles contained in the issues if

the publisher owned the copyright for those articles. See 259
F.3d 65, 69-72 (2d Cir. 2001), as clarified on denial of reh'g,
283 F.3d 502 (2d Cir. 2002), abrogated on other grounds, Reed
Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154, 130 S.Ct. 1237, 176
L.Ed.2d 18 (2010).

And in Streetwise Maps, Inc. v. VanDam, Inc., the Court of
Appeals held that a registration certificate for a derivative
Streetwise Manhattan map permitted the copyright owner to
maintain an action for infringement of an earlier Streetwise

Manhattan map that was included in the derivative maps. 159
F.3d 739, 746-47 (2d Cir. 1998).

The Court of Appeals explained:

because Streetwise is the owner of
the copyright of both the derivative
and pre-existing work, the registration
certificate relating to the derivative
work in this circumstance will
suffice to permit it to maintain an
action for infringement based on
defendants’ infringement of the pre-

existing work. That plaintiff need

WESTLAW

not produce a separate registration
relating to the pre-existing work is
a proposition which finds support
in other courts and in the writings
of scholarly commentators. See, e.g.,
Greenwich Film Prods., S.A. v. DRG
Records, Inc., 833 F. Supp. 248,
251-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (copyright
registration

of derivative work
sufficient for copyright infringement
action based on pre-existing work
where plaintiff owned the copyrights
for both the derivative and pre-existing
work); 2 Melville B. Nimmer & David
Nimmer, Nimmer_on Copyright §
7.16[B][2] (1997) (copyright owners
of derivative work that own pre-
existing work should be able to
pursue copyright infringement action
against individuals infringing the
pre-existing work, even when only
derivative work [is] registered); see
also Woods v. Universal City Studios.
Inc., 920 F. Supp. 62, 64 (S.D.N.Y.

1996) (registration of copyright for

collective work satisfies requirements
of 17 US.C. § 411(a) to bring
copyright infringement action based
on constituent parts where owner of
copyright for collective work also
owns constituent parts).

Streetwise Maps, 159 F.3d at 747; see_also Sylvestre _v.
Oswald, No. 91 CIV 5060, 1993 WL 179101, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.
May 18, 1993) (finding that the registration of a fifteen-
song cassette tape established a valid registration for a song
contained in the cassette).

Nimmer on Copyright, an authoritative treatise on copyrights,
also supports the conclusion that a valid registration for a
collection is a sufficient registration for a constituent part so
long as the copyright holder for the collection also holds the
copyright for the constituent part at issue:


--- Page 5 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

{If] the copyright owner of the
derivative or collective work ... is
itself also the copyright owner [of the
pre-existing work,] ... validating the
registration solely of the derivative
or collective work [would seem]
sufficient to permit maintenance of
an infringement action [for the pre-
existing work] .... At least one court
reached that result based on the
language of the 1909 Act. [See
Rexnord, Inc. v. Mod. Handling
Sys., Inc., 379 F. Supp. 1190 (D.
Del. 1974).] Although there is no
comparable language in the current
Act, the same rule should be followed.
As the Fourth Circuit puts it, when
the same party owns the derivative
or collective work plus the underlying
elements incorporated therein, its
registration of the former is sufficient

to permit an infringement action on
the underlying parts, whether they
be new or preexisting. [See Xoom,
Inc. _v. Imageline, Inc., 323 F.3d
279, 284 (4th Cir. 2003), abrogated
on_other grounds, Reed_ Elsevier,
Inc. _v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154,
130 S.Ct. 1237, 176 L.Ed.2d 18
(2010), although Nimmer notes an
inconsistent footnote.] That rule is

consistent moreover with the current
provision [17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1)] that,
for the purpose of computing statutory
damages, all the parts of a compilation
or derivative work constitute one
work.

*5 2 Melville B. Nimmer and David Nimmer, Nimmer on
Copyright § 7.16[B][5][c] (Matthew Bender, Rev. Ed. 2024).
In this case, London Records registered “Eddy Grant: The
Greatest Hits” in 2002. See Defs.’ Resp. §] 12; Pls.’ Resp.

WESTLAW

4] 6; see _also Registration at 1. “Eddy Grant: The Greatest
Hits” undisputedly contains the sound recording of “Electric
Avenue.” See Agreement at 12. At the time of the registration
on March 22, 2002, London Records, as an affiliate of Warner
Music, was a licensee with all rights in the sound recording
of “Electric Avenue.” See id. at | (“[Greenheart UK] hereby
grant[s] to [Warner Music] the license of the full copyright
in the Recordings for the period of five (5) years from the
date of the first release of the Single “Electric Avenue” in the
UK ....”). The Agreement also provided that Warner Music
was “exclusively entitled to exploit and publicly perform the
Recordings [including Electric Avenue] in the form of the
Compilation ... for the Rights Period throughout the territory.”
Agreement § 1(f). Accordingly, the 2002 registration of
“Eddy Grant: The Greatest Hits” also registered the sound
recording of “Electric Avenue.” When the Agreement expired
by its terms no later than September 20, 2006, see Defs.’ Resp.
4] 13, the copyright ownership of the Recording reverted back
to the plaintiffs.

B.

In their papers, the defendants argued that the Registration
itself did not cover “Electric Avenue.”

“{IJn general, the nature of authorship defines the scope of
the registration ....” Ward v. Barnes & Noble, Inc., 93 F.
Supp. 3d 193, 204 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). “Minor mistakes in a
registration statement, made in good faith and unaccompanied
by deceptive intent, will not serve to invalidate registration.”
Greenwich Film Prods., 833 F. Supp. at 252 (citing Gund, Inc.
vy. Swank, Inc., 673 F.Supp. 1233, 1273 (S.D.N.Y. 1987)).

The defendants argue that the Registration does not cover the
sound recording of “Electric Avenue” because the plaintiffs
conceded in the “authorship” field that the Registration is for
a “compilation.” See Defs.’ Reply at 2. However, as explained
above, registration of a compilation may nevertheless be
sufficient to register a constituent work.

The defendants also argue that the Registration explicitly
“disclaimed” registration of certain “preexisting” recordings.
See id. However, the Registration does not “disclaim” any
registration. Rather, as plaintiffs’ counsel explained, the
Registration did not seek to register a copyright for any work


--- Page 6 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

that was previously copyrighted and the sound recording of
Electric Avenue was not previously registered. Given the
lenient nature of the registration requirement, see Sylvestre,
1993 WL 179101, at *2, the registration should not be
construed to exclude previously published but unregistered
works.

Accordingly, the registration of “Eddy Grant: The Greatest
Hits” in 2002 effected the registration of the sound recording
of “Electric Avenue” that was contained in that compilation.

Cc.

The defendants argue that the registration for a collective
work does not include the registration for any previously
published part but have failed to point to any case that
supports that proposition.

*6 The defendants cite to the Compendium and other
Copyright Office documents to argue that, for the registration
of a collective or derivative work to cover the constituent
parts, the constituent parts must have previously been
unpublished at the time of registration. See Defs.’ Mot. at
9-10.

As an initial matter, Copyright Office documents are not
binding on courts but are owed deference to the extent they
are persuasive. See, e.g., EMI Christian Music Grp., Inc. v.
MP3tunes, LLC, 844 F.3d 79, 97 (2d Cir. 2016).

Courts in the Second Circuit have not interpreted copyright
laws to require that constituent parts must have been
unpublished at the time of the registration of the collective
or derivative work. In Streetwise Maps, the constituent work
—the Streetwise Manhattan map from 1984 or 1985—was
clearly published before the registration of the derivative
work in 1989. See 159 F.3d at 747-78. The fact that
the constituent work had been published previously was
irrelevant. Furthermore, in Woods, the court found that the
registration of a collection was sufficient registration for a
drawing that had been published previously. See 920 F. Supp.
at 64.

While the Compendium does provide that “[a]n applicant
may register a collective work together with the separate

WESTLAW

and independent works contained therein ... if the component
works have not been previously published,” Compendium §
509.1 (regarding collective works), this provision appears to
reflect only the Copyright Office's policy-based preference
for separate registrations where possible. The Compendium
also provides that “[iJf a collective work contains an
appreciable amount of [previously published material], the
applicant generally should limit the claim to the new material
that the author contributed to the work and the [previously
published] material should be excluded from the claim.” Id.
§ 509.2 (emphasis added).

The defendants quote the Compendium to say that “a
registration for a compilation does not cover any previously
published material ....”. Compendium § 508.2. However,
that quote appears between citations to Feist Publications.
Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 111
S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991), and the Compendium's
warning that “[t]he data, facts, or other uncopyrightable
material that appears in a compilation is not protected by the
copyright in that work” and “that the copyright in a factual
compilation is thin.” Compendium § 508.2. Therefore, the

reference to “previously published material” in section 508.2
of the Compendium likely refers to data or facts published
in a compilation like a phonebook, where the previously
published material is factual material that is not able to be
copyrighted. That type of material is distinguishable from the
prior recording in this case.

Accordingly, the defendants’ argument that “Electric
Avenue” must have been unpublished at the time of the
registration of “Eddy Grant: The Greatest Hits” is not

persuasive.

In short, the Agreement gave London Records the right to
register the copyright on the Compilation that included the
sound recording of Electric Avenue. London Records filed
that registration and there is nothing in the registration or
the law that precluded the application of that registration
to the sound recording of Electric Avenue. Therefore, the
defendants’ motion for summary judgment dismissing the
claim for copyright infringement of the recording of Electric
Avenue (Count II) is denied.

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

Iv.

*7 The plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment,
finding the defendants liable for copyright infringement.
They argue that the only defense to liability is fair use,
and that there are no issues of material fact and that the
fair use defense does not apply in this case. See Pls.’
Mot. at 13-14. There is no dispute that the composition
and the sound recording of the musical performance for
“Electric Avenue” were used without permission and that
the Composition was copyrighted. See Defs.’ Opp'n at 3, 6,
ECF No. 114. As discussed above, the plaintiffs also hold a
valid copyright registration covering the sound recording of
“Electric Avenue.” The only defense that the defendants raise
is that the Video's use of “Electric Avenue” was a fair use. See
id. at 6. Therefore, the only bar to a finding of liability by the
defendants for copyright infringement as alleged in Counts I
and II of the Complaint is the defense of fair use.

Pursuant to the Copyright Act of 1976, fair use is a complete
defense to a claim of copyright infringement. See 17 U.S.C. §
107. “The fair-use doctrine seeks to strike a balance between
an artist's intellectual property rights to the fruits of her own
creative labor, including the right to license and develop (or
refrain from licensing or developing) derivative works based
on that creative labor, and the ability of other authors, artists,
and the rest of us to express them—or ourselves by reference
to the works of others.” Andy Warhol Found. for Visual Arts

Inc. v. Goldsmith, 11 F.4th 26, 36 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting
Blanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d 244, 250 (2d Cir. 2006)), aff'd 598
U.S. 508, 143 S.Ct. 1258, 215 L.Ed.2d 473 (2023).

The Copyright Act provides a non-exhaustive list of four
factors that courts are to consider in making a fair use
determination:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether
such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work.

WESTLAW

17 U.S.C. § 107. “The Act's fair use provision ... sets forth
general principles, the application of which requires judicial
balancing, depending upon relevant circumstances.” Andy
Warhol Found., 598 U.S. at 527, 143 S.Ct. 1258 (quoting
Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc., 593 U.S. 1, 19, 141 S.Ct.
1183, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021)). “[I]n applying the fair use
provision, copyright's protection may be stronger where the
copyrighted material serves an artistic rather than a utilitarian

function.” Id.

“[F]air use is an affirmative defense, and [the defendants]
bear[ ] the burden to justify its taking of [the plaintiffs]
work ....” Id. at 547 n.21, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

A.

The first fair use factor concerns “the purpose and character
of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes[.]” 17 U.S.C.
§ 107(1).

“The central question [the first factor] asks is whether the new
work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation
(supplanting the original), or instead adds something new,
with a further purpose or different character.” Andy Warhol
Found., 598 U.S. at 528, 143 S.Ct. 1258 (quoting Campbell v.
Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164,
127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)).

The “purposes” listed in the preamble paragraph of § 107
—such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,
scholarship, or research—treflect the sorts of copying that
courts most commonly have found to be fair uses and so
may guide the first fair use factor inquiry. See id. (quoting
17 U.S.C. § 107; Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577-78, 114 S.Ct.
1164). These purposes ordinarily do not supersede the objects
of, or supplant, the work; rather, they use the work to serve a
distinct end. See id. In other words, “a use may be justified
because copying is reasonably necessary to achieve the user's
new purpose.” Id. at 532, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

The question is one of “to what extent” because many
secondary works add something new. See id. at 528-29, 143
S.Ct. 1258. “The larger the difference, the more likely the first
factor weighs in favor of fair use.” Id. at 529, 143 S.Ct. 1258.


--- Page 8 ---

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

“A use that has a further purpose or different character is said
to be transformative[,] [and] transformativeness is a matter
of degree.” Id. (citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164).

*8 In this case, the Video has a very low degree of
“transformativeness,” if any at all. As this Court found in
denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss, the Video “is best
described as a wholesale copying of music to accompany
a political campaign ad.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 285.
“[T]he video's creator did not edit the song's lyrics, vocals, or
instrumentals at all, and the song is immediately recognizable
when it begins playing around the fifteen-second mark of the
video, notwithstanding that audio of President Biden's speech
can be heard simultaneously.” Id. “Moreover, the animation
does not use Electric Avenue as a vehicle to deliver its satirical
message, and it makes no effort to poke fun at the song or
Grant.” Id. “[T]he song—which plays for over two-thirds
of the duration of the video—is a major component of the
impression created by the animation, even though it appears
that the video's creator could have chosen nearly any other
music to serve the same entertaining purpose.” Id. at 286.
“[A]Jnd the defendants have offered no justification for their
extensive borrowing.” Id. at 285.

The defendants once again rely on Brown v. Netflix, Inc.,
462 F. Supp. 3d 453 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), affid, 855 F. App'x
61 (2d Cir. 2021), to argue that an unaltered secondary use

may nevertheless be transformative. See Defs.’ Opp'n at 10.
However, as this Court has already held, the use in this case
“is different in magnitude and kind [from that in Brown]:
the song plays for more than two-thirds of the animation
and plays no discernible role in communicating the video's
overarching political commentary.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d
at 286. In Brown, “the excerpt of the song was situated
within a performance about which the documentary was
commenting, ... the song could be heard only briefly and
in passing[,] ... [and] the content of the song substantively
contributed to the burlesque act.” Id. (citing 462 F. Supp. 3d
at 458).

The defendants also argue that the Video “transformed Grant's
original conception of Electric Avenue as a protest against
social conditions into a colorful attack on the character
and personality traits of a rival political figure.” See Defs.’
Opp'nat 11. Again, “the defendants’ argument misapprehends
the focus of the transformative use inquiry.” Grant, 563 F.

WESTLAW

Supp. 3d at 284. “While it is true that the animation is
partisan political commentary and the song apparently is
not, the inquiry does not focus exclusively on the character
of the animation; rather, it focuses on the character of
the animation's use of Grant's song.” Id. “[T]he video's
overarching political purpose does not automatically render
its use of any non-political work transformative.” Id. at 285
(citing Henley v. DeVore, 733 F. Supp. 2d 1144, 1164 (C.D.
Cal. 2010); Browne v. McCain, 612 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1129-31
(C.D. Cal. 2009)). In Andy Warhol Foundation, the Supreme
Court “rejected the idea that any secondary work that adds
a new aesthetic or new expression to its source material is
necessarily transformative.” 598 U.S. at 543, 143 S.Ct. 1258.
To so hold “would swallow the copyright owner's exclusive
right to prepare derivative works.” Id. at 541, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

In assessing the first fair use factor, the Court must
also consider whether the allegedly infringing use is
of a commercial nature. See id. at 531, 143 S.Ct.
1258. Commercialism too, is not dispositive; “[t]he more
transformative the new work, the less will be the significance
of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against
a finding of fair use[.]” Id. (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at
579, 114S.Ct. 1164).

The question of whether the work is commercial “is not
whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but
whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the
copyrighted material without paying the customary price.”
Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S.
539, 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985); see also
Andy Warhol Found., 598 U.S. at 537, 143 S.Ct. 1258
(quoting Harper). “Monetary gain is not the sole criterion,”

especially in settings where “profit is ill-measured in dollars.”
Weissmann v. Freeman, 868 F.2d 1313, 1324 (2d Cir. 1989).
In this case, the defendants benefited commercially from
using Electric Avenue without paying a licensing fee.

*9 As this Court found in deciding the motion to dismiss,
“there is a well-established market for music licensing,
[and] the defendants sought to gain an advantage by using
Grant's popular song without paying Grant the customary
licensing fee.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 287. Therefore,
“the possibility of commercial advantage [could not] be
excluded at th[at] point[.]” Id. Since then, the defendants have
not presented any evidence to suggest that the Video's use
was not commercial in nature. Rather, the defendants argue


--- Page 9 ---

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

that the use of the song “did not give the Defendants any
commercial advantage” because the Video was created by an
unaffiliated third-party, and the plaintiffs have pointed to no
evidence that the Trump campaign received any donations
as a result of the Tweet containing the Video. Defs.’ Opp'n
at 10-11 (distinguishing Henley). However, monetary gain,
such as campaign contributions, is not required to show that
the use was commercial. See, e.g., Weissmann, 868 F.2d at
1324 (“[W)]hat is valuable is recognition because it so often
influences professional advancement and academic tenure.”’).

The defendants also argue that the plaintiffs “have never
licensed the Song for political use, and have strongly
indicated that they have no interest of doing so in the future[.]”
Defs.’ Opp'n at 11. But as the Court previously held, “[i]t is
plain that widespread, uncompensated use of Grant's music
in promotional videos—political or otherwise—would ...
undermine Grant's ability to obtain compensation in exchange
for licensing his music.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 289.

It is surely true that the use of the copyrighted material
has fewer aspects of a “commercial nature” because it is
not used for profit, but the lack of a profit motive is
insufficient to overcome the lack of a “transformative use”
for purposes of the first fair use factor. See Hachette Book
Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive, No. 23-1260, —— F.4th ——,
——,, 2024 WL 4031751, at *12 (2d Cir. Sept. 4, 2024)
(transformativeness remains the ‘central’ focus of the first

factor’).

Accordingly, the first fair use factor favors the plaintiffs.

B.

The second fair use factor “directs courts to consider the
nature of the copyrighted work, including (1) whether it is
expressive or creative or more factual, with a greater leeway
being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work is factual
or informational, and (2) whether the work is published or
unpublished, with the scope of fair use involving unpublished
works being considerably narrower.” Andy Warhol Found.,
11 F4th at 45 (quoting Blanch, 467 F.3d at 256).

As the Court previously found, “[a]s to the first consideration,
it is clear that Electric Avenue is a creative work and therefore

WESTLAW

is closer to the core of intended copyright protection.” Grant,
563 F. Supp. 3d at 287-88 (citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at
586, 114 S.Ct. 1164; Henley, 733 F. Supp. 2d at 1160). The
defendants “concede that [Electric Avenue] is a creative and
published work, and therefore the second fair use factor favors
Plaintiffs.” Defs.’ Opp'n at 14.

Accordingly, the second factor, although “assigned limited
weight in the overall fair use determination[,]” Grant, 563 F.
Supp. 3d at 288 (citing Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804
F.3d 202, 220 (2d Cir. 2015)), favors the plaintiffs.

Cc.

The third fair use factor considers “the amount and
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). “In assessing this
factor, [the court] consider[s] not only the quantity of the
materials used but also their quality and importance in relation
to the original work.” Andy Warhol Found., 11 F.4th at 45—
46 (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 587, 114 S.Ct. 1164).

As this Court found in its decision denying the defendants’
motion to dismiss, “[t]he song plays for the majority of the
animation; the excerpt is of central importance to the original
work; and the defendants have not articulated any purpose for
the copying.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 288. The defendants
“likewise concede that because the length of the excerpted
portion of [Electric Avenue] and the percentage of time that
it takes up in the Video are undisputed, there is no issue of
material fact as to [the third fair use factor].” Defs.’ Opp'n at
14.

*10 Accordingly, this factor also favors the plaintiffs.

D.

The fourth and final fair use factor asks “whether, if the
challenged use becomes widespread, it will adversely affect
the potential market for the copyrighted work. Analysis of this
factor requires [the court] to balance the benefit the public
will derive if the use is permitted and the personal gain the
copyright owner will receive if the use is denied.” Andy
Warhol Found., 11 F.4th at 48 (quoting Bill Graham Archives

Grant v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605, 613 (2d Cir. 2006);
Wright v. Warner Books, Inc., 953 F.2d 731, 739 (2d Cir.
1991)). “This analysis embraces both the primary market for
the work and any derivative markets that exist or that its
author might reasonably license others to develop, regardless
of whether the particular author claiming infringement has
elected to develop such markets.” Id. (citing Salinger v.
Colting, 607 F.3d 68, 74, 83 (2d Cir. 2010)). In other words,
the issue “is not solely whether the secondary work harms
an existing market for the specific work alleged to have
been infringed. Rather, [the court] must also consider whether
unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in
by [the defendants] would result in a substantially adverse

impact on the potential market[.]” Id. at 49 (citing Campbell,
510 USS. at 590, 114 S.Ct. 1164).

In this case, there is no public benefit as a result of the
defendants’ use of “Electric Avenue.” As the plaintiffs
correctly argue, the defendants “could have used any song,
created a new song, or used no song at all, to convey the
same political message in the Infringing Video.” Pls.’ Reply
at 5, ECF No. 121. And as the Court previously found, while
“political speech ... is a rich part of our First Amendment
tradition[,] ... denying the defendants’ fair use defense in this
case ... will not chill legitimate political satire.” Grant, 563
F. Supp. 3d at 289. Even after discovery in this case, the
defendants provide no evidence of public benefit. See Defs.”
Opp'n at 11-14.

There is, however, evidence that if the challenged use
becomes widespread, it will adversely affect the potential
market for “Electric Avenue.” As this Court held, “[iJt
is plain that widespread, uncompensated use of Grant's
music in promotional videos—political or otherwise—would
embolden would-be infringers and undermine Grant's ability
to obtain compensation in exchange for licensing his music.”
Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 289.

The defendants claim that the plaintiffs “have [since] admitted
that the Video has not impaired their ability to exploit
the markets to which they have traditionally licensed the
Song.” Defs.’ Opp'n at 14. To the contrary, the plaintiffs
have submitted evidence, see Grant Decl., Exs. 8-10, ECF
No. 107-8—107-10, “that widespread, uncompensated use of
Grant's music in promotional videos—political or otherwise
—would embolden would-be infringers and undermine

WESTLAW

Grant's ability to obtain compensation in exchange for
licensing his music.” Grant, 563 F. Supp. 3d at 289. Moreover,
it is the defendants’ burden to show that there is no genuine
issue of material fact that the plaintiffs were not harmed, see
id. at 284, and the defendants have made no such showing.

*11 The defendants also argue that the plaintiffs “have
previously shown no interest in licensing the Song for
political use, and have strongly indicated that they have no
interest in doing so in the future[.]” Defs.’ Opp'n at 14.
However, the definition of “potential markets” is not so
narrow; it includes any markets that “creators of original
works would in general develop or license others to develop.”
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 592, 114 S.Ct. 1164. The plaintiffs’
ability to license “Electric Avenue” in the market for licensed
music for videos—political or otherwise—would be affected
by widespread, uncompensated use.

Accordingly, the last fair use factor favors the plaintiffs.

In summary, the Court has applied the fair use factors and
finds that each factor favors the plaintiffs. Therefore, the
plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment dismissing
the defendants’ defense of fair use is granted. Because the
defendants have asserted no further defense, the plaintiffs
are entitled to summary judgment on liability for copyright
infringement against the defendants.

CONCLUSION

The Court has considered all of the parties’ arguments. To
the extent not specifically addressed above, those arguments
are either moot or without merit. For the reasons explained
above, the defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment
dismissing Count II is denied. The plaintiffs’ motion for
summary judgment dismissing the defendants’ “fair use”
defense is granted, and the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment
on liability.

SO ORDERED.

“A derivative work is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, ... in which a work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted.” 17 U.S.C. § 101. “A collective work is a work ... in which a number of contributions,
constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.” Id. “A
compilation is a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are
selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original
work of authorship. The term compilation includes collective works.” Id. The plaintiffs argue that “Eddy Grant:
The Greatest Hits” is a derivative and collective work, as well as a compilation. See Pls.’ Opp'n at 5-6, ECF
No. 118. The defendants attempt to argue that “Eddy Grant: The Greatest Hits” is not a derivative work, but
fail to provide any reasoning for this argument. See Defs.’ Reply at 3-4, ECF No. 124.

This principle is distinguishable from cases where the copyright owner of the collective or derivative work does
not have copyright ownership over the constituent parts because the constituent parts are not copyrightable.

Nintendo of America Inc., and Nintendo Co., Ltd. sell the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Two of Nintendo's
competitors, Atari Games Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tengen, Inc., sued Nintendo for, among other things,
unfair competition, Sherman Act violations, and patent infringement. Nintendo sued Atari for, among other things, unfair
competition, patent infringement, copyright infringement, and trade secret violations. The United States District Court for the
Northern District of California consolidated the two cases and preliminarily enjoined Atari from exploiting Nintendo's
copyrighted computer program. Because Nintendo has shown a likelihood of success on its copyright infringement claims,
this court affirms.

BACKGROUND

Nintendo's home video game system--the NES--includes a monitor, console, and controls. The console is a base unit
into which a user inserts game cartridges. These cartridges contain the various game programs for the NES. As dictated by
the program on the cartridge, the console controls an image on a video monitor, often a television set. In response to this
video display, the user interacts with the system by manipulating the controls. Thus, by operating the controls in response to
the video image, an individual plays the game on the cartridge in the NES console.

For instance, the game program may control a maze or set of obstacles on the video display. The user then
manipulates the controls to guide an object through the maze or set of obstacles. The game program

Page 836
then awards the user points for proficiently passing through the maze or obstacles.

Nintendo designed a program--the 10NES--to prevent the NES from accepting unauthorized game cartridges. Both the
NES console and authorized game cartridges contain microprocessors or chips programed with the 10NES. The console
contains a ""master chip"" or ""lock."" Authorized game cartridges contain a ""slave chip"" or ""key."" When a user inserts an
authorized cartridge into a console, the slave chip in effect unlocks the console; the console detects a coded message and
accepts the game cartridge. When a user inserts an unauthorized cartridge, the console detects no unlocking message and
refuses to operate the cartridge. Nintendo's 10NES program thus controls access to the NES.

Atari first attempted to analyze and replicate the NES security system in 1986. Atari could not break the 10NES
program code by monitoring the communication between the master and slave chips. Atari next tried to break the code by
analyzing the chips themselves. Atari analysts chemically peeled layers from the NES chips to allow microscopic
examination of the object code. ' Nonetheless, Atari still could not decipher the code sufficiently to replicate the NES
security system.

In December 1987, Atari became a Nintendo licensee. Atari paid Nintendo to gain access to the NES for its video


--- Page 2 ---
games. The license terms, however, strictly controlled Atari's access to Nintendo's technology, including the 10NES
program. Under the license, Nintendo would take Atari's games, place them in cartridges containing the 10NES program,
and resell them to Atari. Atari could then market the games to NES owners. Nintendo limited all licensees, including Atari, to
five new NES games per year. The Nintendo license also prohibited Atari from licensing NES games to other home video
game systems for two years from Atari's first sale of the game.

In early 1988, Atari's attorney applied to the Copyright Office for a reproduction of the 10NES program. The application
stated that Atari was a defendant in an infringement action and needed a copy of the program for that litigation. Atari falsely
alleged that it was a present defendant in a case in the Northern District of California. Atari assured the ""Library of Congress
that the requested copy [would] be used only in connection with the specified litigation."" In fact, no suit existed between the
parties until December 1988, when Atari sued Nintendo for antitrust violations and unfair competition. Nintendo filed no
infringement action against Atari until November 1989.

After obtaining the 10NES source code from the Copyright Office, Atari again tried to read the object code from peeled
chips. Through microscopic examination, Atari's analysts transcribed the 10NES object code into a handwritten
representation of zeros and ones. Atari used the information from the Copyright Office to correct errors in this transcription.
The Copyright Office copy facilitated Atari's replication of the 10NES object code.

After deciphering the 10NES program, Atari developed its own program--the Rabbit program--to unlock the NES. Atari's
Rabbit program generates signals indistinguishable from the 10NES program. The Rabbit uses a different microprocessor.
The Rabbit chip, for instance, operates faster. Thus, to generate signals recognizable by the 10NES master chip, the Rabbit
program must include pauses. Atari also programmed the Rabbit in a different language. Because Atari chose a different
microprocessor and programming language, the line-by-line instructions of the 10NES and Rabbit programs vary.
Nonetheless, as the district court found, the

Page 837

Rabbit program generates signals functionally indistinguishable from the 10NES program. The Rabbit gave Atari access to
NES owners without Nintendo's strict license conditions.

Nintendo asked the district court to enjoin Atari's alleged infringement of its 1ONES copyright. Atari sought in a separate
motion to enjoin Nintendo's alleged antitrust violations and alleged misuse of its property rights. Nintendo prevailed on both
motions. Atari appealed both rulings but subsequently moved to dismiss its appeal from the denial of its motion for a
preliminary injunction. This court granted that motion. Atari asserts copyright misuse as a defense to copyright infringement.

ANALYSIS

Because this action includes patent infringement claims, this court has jurisdiction over this appeal. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1292,
1295, 1338 (1988). To resolve issues of copyright law, this court applies the law as interpreted by the regional circuits, in this
case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Atari Games v. Nintendo of Am., 897 F.2d 1572 , 1575
(Fed.Cir.1990); Cicena Ltd. v. Columbia Telecommunications Group, 900 F.2d 1546 (Fed.Cir.1990) .

The Ninth Circuit sustains preliminary injunctions if the movant shows ""either a likelihood of success on the merits and
the possibility of irreparable injury, or that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships
tips sharply in its favor."" Johnson Controls v. Phoenix Control Sys.. 886 F.2d 1173 , 1174 (9th Cir.1989); accord Ocean
Garden v. Marktrade Co., 953 F.2d 500 , 506 (9th Cir.1991). In a claim for copyright infringement, ""a showing of a
reasonable likelihood of success on the merits raises a presumption of irreparable harm."" Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at
1174.

The Ninth Circuit vacates a preliminary injunction ""only if the district court abused its discretion, or based its decision on
an erroneous legal standard or clearly erroneous findings of fact."" Id.; accord Ocean Garden, 953 F.2d at 502 ; Associated
Gen. Contractors of Cal. v. Coalition for Economic Equity, 950 F.2d 1401 , 1405 (9th Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----112
S.Ct. 1670 , 118 L.Ed.2d 390 (1992) . The Ninth Circuit reviews ""de novo the correctness of the legal standards employed
by the district court in evaluating the plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits."" Associated Gen. Contractors, 950 F.2d at
1405 .

Thus, following Ninth Circuit caselaw, this court must determine whether Nintendo has shown a likelihood of success
on its prima facie case of copyright infringement and a likelihood that it will overcome Atari's copyright misuse defense. See
H.H. Robertson, Co. v. United Steel Deck, 820 F.2d 384 , 388-89 (Fed.Cir.1987) (entitlement to preliminary injunction ""is
determined in the context of presumptions and burdens that inhere at trial on the merits""); Gutierrez v. Municipal Court of the
Southeast Judicial District, County of Los Angeles, 838 F.2d 1031 , 1038-45 (9th Cir.1988); Half Moon Bay Fishermans’
Marketing v. Carlucci, 857 F.2d 505 , 507-12 (9th Cir.1988); Hale v. Department of Energy. 806 F.2d 910 , 915-18 (9th
Cir.1986).

Copyright Infringement

To prevail on its copyright infringement claim, Nintendo must show ownership of the 10NES program copyright and
copying by Atari of protectable expression from the 10NES program. Feist Publications v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., --- U.S. ----,
111 S.Ct. 1282 1296, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) ; Brown Bag Software v. Symantec Corp., 960 F.2d 1465 , 1472 (9th
Cir.1992); Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at 1175 . The parties do not dispute that Nintendo owns the 10NES copyright.



--- Page 3 ---
Therefore, Nintendo need only prove that Atari copied protectable expression from the 10NES program.

Nintendo can show copying by proving that Atari made literal copies of the 10NES program. Alternatively, Nintendo can
show copying by proving that Atari had access to the 10NES program and that Atari's work--the Rabbit program--is
substantially

Page 838

similar to Nintendo's work in ideas and the expression of those ideas. Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at 1176 ; Landsberg v.
Scrabble Crossword Game Players, 736 F.2d 485 , 488 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1037 , 105 S.Ct. 513 , 83 L.Ed.2d
403 (1984) . The parties do not dispute that Atari had access to the 10NES program. Thus, to show non-literal copyright
infringement, Nintendo must ultimately prove substantial similarity between the 10NES and the Rabbit in protectable
expression. To determine whether Nintendo is likely to so prove, this court must first distinguish protectable expression from
the unprotected elements of the 10NES program. Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at 1175 .

Copyright Overview

Article |, § 8, cl. 8, of the Constitution gives Congress power ""[T]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by
securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."" The
Constitution thus gives Congress the authority to set the parameters of authors’ exclusive rights. Sony Corp. of Am. v.
Universal City Studios, 464 U.S. 417 , 429, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 782, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) 2. The Copyright Act of 1976, in
general, protects ""original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression."" 17 U.S.C. § 102(a) (1988). To
explain the term ""works of authorship,"" the Act sets forth a statutory list of categories within the term. The first category on
this non-exclusive list is ""literary works."" Id.

The statutory definition of ""literary works"" embraces computer programs:

""Literary works"" are works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical
symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords,
film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied.

17 U.S.C. § 101 (1980). As works ""expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia,""
computer programs fall within the terms of the 1976 Act. The House Report for the 1976 Act explicitly includes computer
programs within ""literary works"":

The term ""literary works"" does not connote any criterion of literary merit or qualitative value: it includes ... computer data
bases, and computer programs to the extent that they incorporate authorship in the programmer's expression of original
ideas, as distinguished from the ideas themselves.

H.R.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 54 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5667. As literary works,
copyright protection extends to computer programs, see, e.g., Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d 1173 , 1175; S.O.S., Inc. v.
Payday, Inc., 886 F.2d 1081 (9th Cir.1989) , and to instructions encoded on silicon chips,Apple Computer v. Formula
International, 725 F.2d 521 (9th Cir.1984) .

The 1976 Act, however, sets limits on the scope of copyright protection. In the words of the Supreme Court, ""[t]he mere
fact that a work is copyrighted does not mean that every element of the work may be protected."" Feist, --- U.S. at ----, 111
S.Ct. at 1289 ; accord Harper & Row, Publishers v. Nation Enter., 471 U.S. 539 , 547-48, 105 S.Ct. 2218 2224, 85 L. Ed. 2d
588 (1985) . Section 102(b) of title 17 states:

In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system,
method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or
embodied in such work.

17 U.S.C. § 102(b). The 1976 House Report on section 102(b) applies this limitation directly to computer programs.

Some concern has been expressed lest copyright in computer programs should extend protection to the methodology
or processes adopted by the programmer, rather than merely to the ""writing"" expressing

Page 839
his ideas. Section 102(b) is intended, among other things, to make clear that the expression adopted by the programmer is
the copyrightable element in a computer program, and that the actual processes or methods embodied in the program are
not within the scope of the copyright law.

H.R.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 57 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5670.

Protectable Expression

This overview of copyright law explains the trial court's initial task is separating protectable expression in the 10NES
program from unprotectable ideas, facts, processes, and methods of operation. The Copyright Act, however, contains no
explicit standards for separating a computer program's expression from its idea. Rather this court must examine tests used


--- Page 4 ---
for other literary works to distinguish expression from idea.
Judge Learned Hand devised an abstraction test to separate the idea from expression in written or dramatic works:

Upon any work ... a great number of patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well, as more and more of the incident is
left out.... [T]here is a point in this series of abstractions where they are no longer protected, since otherwise the playwright
could prevent the use of his ""ideas,"" to which, apart from their expression, his property is never extended.

Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119, 121 (2d Cir.1930), cert. denied,282 U.S. 902 ,51 S.Ct. 216 , 75
L.Ed. 795 (1931) . Our sister circuit recently applied this test in a computer program copyright case. Computer Assocs. Int'l v.
Altai, Inc., 1992 WL 139364, 23 USPQ2d 1241 , 1252-53 (2d Cir.1992); cf., Whelan Assocs. v. Jaslow Dental Lab., 797 F.2d
1222 (3d Cir.1986) , cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1031 , 107 S.Ct. 877 , 93 L.Ed.2d 831 (1987) . Judge Hand's abstraction
analysis forces differentiation of the unprotectable idea and protectable expression. The abstraction method also properly
recognizes that a computer program contains many distinct ideas. Computer Assocs. Int'l, 23 USPQ2d at 1253 . The Ninth
Circuit as well endorses dissection of a copyrighted work. Brown Bag, 960 F.2d at 1475-76 . By separating the program into
manageable components, this method eases the court's task of discerning the boundaries of protectable expression.

After separating the program into manageable components, the court must next filter the unprotectable components of
the program from the protectable expression. See Computer Assocs. Int'l, 23 USPQ2d at 1253 . The court must filter out as
unprotectable the ideas, expression necessarily incident to the idea, expression already in the public domain, expression
dictated by external factors (like the computer's mechanical specifications, compatibility with other programs, and demands
of the industry served by the program), and expression not original to the programmer or author. Id., 23 USPQ2d at 1253 ,
1255, 1256; see also Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 548 , 105 S.Ct. at 2224 ; Plains Cotton Coop. Ass'n v. Goodpasture
Computer Serv., 807 F.2d 1256 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 821 , 108 S.Ct. 80 , 98 L.Ed.2d 42 (1987) .

In addition, copyright protection does not ""extend to any ... procedure, process, system [or] method of operation."" 17
U.S.C. § 102(b). In conformance with the standards of patent law, title 35 provides protection for the process or method
performed by a computer in accordance with a program. See Arrhythmia Research Technology v. Corazonix Corp., 958 F.2d
1053 (Fed.Cir.1992) . Thus, patent and copyright laws protect distinct aspects of a computer program. See Baker v. Selden
101 U.S. 99 , 103, 25 L.Ed. 841 (1879) . Title 35 protects the process or method performed by a computer program; title 17
protects the expression of that process or method. While title 35 protects any novel, nonobvious, and useful process, title 17
can protect a multitude of expressions that implement that process. If the patentable process is embodied inextricably in the
line-by-line instructions of the computer program, however, then the process merges

Page 840

with the expression and precludes copyright protection. See Formula Int'l, 725 F.2d at 525 ; Apple Computer v. Franklin
Computer, 714 F.2d 1240 , 1253 (3d Cir.1983), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 1033 , 104 S.Ct. 690 , 79 L.Ed.2d 158 (1984) .

This court, in applying Ninth Circuit law, must determine whether each component of the 10NES program ""qualifies as
an expression of an idea, or an idea itself."" Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at 1175 . This determination depends on ""the
particular facts of each case."" Id.

Nintendo's 10NES program contains more than an idea or expression necessarily incident to an idea. Nintendo
incorporated within the 10NES program creative organization and sequencing unnecessary to the lock and key function.
Nintendo chose arbitrary programming instructions and arranged them in a unique sequence to create a purely arbitrary data
stream. This data stream serves as the key to unlock the NES. Nintendo may protect this creative element of the 1ONES
under copyright.

External factors did not dictate the design of the 10NES program. Nintendo may have incorporated some minimal
portions of the program to accommodate the microprocessor in the NES, but no external factor dictated the bulk of the
program. Nor did Nintendo take this program from the public domain. By registering the 10NES with the Copyright Office,
Nintendo obtained the benefit of a presumption of originality which Atari does not rebut on this record.

Finally, Nintendo seeks to protect the creative element of its program beyond the literal expression used to effect the
unlocking process. The district court defined the unprotectable 10NES idea or process as the generation of a data stream to
unlock a console. This court discerns no clear error in the district court's conclusion. The unique arrangement of computer
program expression which generates that data stream does not merge with the process so long as alternate expressions
are available. Formula Int'l, 725 F.2d at 525 . In this case, Nintendo has produced expert testimony showing a multitude of
different ways to generate a data stream which unlocks the NES console.

At this stage in the proceedings of this case, Nintendo has made a sufficient showing that its 1ONES program contains
protectable expression. After filtering unprotectable elements out of the 10NES program, this court finds no error in the
district court's conclusion that 10NES contains protectable expression. Nintendo independently created the 10NES program
and exercised creativity in the selection and arrangement of its instruction lines. See Bellsouth Advertising & Publishing v.
Donnelly Info. Publishing, 933 F.2d 952 , 957 (11th Cir.1991) (selection, coordination, or arrangement of information
constitutes originality). The security function of the program necessitated an original signal combination to act as a lock and
key for the NES console. To generate an original signal, Nintendo had to design an original program. In sum, the district
court properly discerned that the 10NES program contains protectable expression. At a minimum, Nintendo may protect
under copyright the unique and creative arrangement of instructions in the 10NES program.



--- Page 5 ---
Next, this court must determine whether the district court correctly determined that Nintendo has shown sufficient
evidence that Atari either literally copied the 10NES or had access to the 10NES and produced a substantially similar copy.
Nintendo argues that Atari's unauthorized acquisition of a copy from the Copyright Office literally infringed the 10ONES
program. Nintendo also argues that copies of the 10NES program made in the reverse engineering process literally infringe
the 10NES copyright. Finally, Nintendo argues that Atari's Rabbit program is substantially similar to the 10NES and therefore
infringes the 10NES copyright. A single copy is sufficient to support a claim of copyright infringement. See 17 U.S.C. § 106;

1 U.S.C. § 1 (1988) (""Words imparting the plural include the singular""); S.Rep. No. 94-473 at 58 (1975); H.R.Rep. No. 94-
1476 at 61 (1976). Even for works warranting little copyright protection, verbatim copying is infringement.

Page 841

See Data East USA v. Epyx, Inc., 862 F.2d 204 , 209 (9th Cir.1988); Sid & Marty Krofft Television Prods. v. McDonald's
Corp., 562 F.2d 1157 , 1168 (9th Cir.1977).

Verbatim Copying

Atari acquired a copy of the 10NES program from the Copyright Office and used it to replicate the 10NES source code.
The Copyright Act states:

Copies or reproductions of deposited articles retained under the control of the Copyright Office shall be authorized or
furnished only under the conditions specified by the Copyright Office regulations.

17 U.S.C. § 706(b). In conformance with protective regulations, this provision permits access to copyrighted works.
Copies obtained from the Copyright Office in violation of the regulations, however, are unauthorized reproductions.

Section 201.2(d)(2) of the Regulations of the Copyright Office (as amended through July 1, 1986), permit reproduction
only if: (1) the copyright owner grants permission, (2) a court orders reproduction, or (3)

(ii) The Copyright Office receives a written request from an attorney on behalf of either the plaintiff or defendant in
connection with litigation, actual or prospective, involving the copyrighted work. The following information must be included
in such a request: (A) The names of all the parties involved and the nature of the controversy; (B) the name of the court in
which the actual case is pending or, in the case of a prospective proceeding, a full statement of the facts of the controversy
in which the copyrighted work is involved; and (C) satisfactory assurance that the requested reproduction will be used only in
connection with the specified litigation.

Id. Under this regulation, Atari requested the 10NES program in 1988. °

Section 201.2(d)(2) refers to ""litigation, actual or prospective."" The term ""prospective litigation,"" as used in the
regulation, means more than a subjective expectation of litigation at some unspecified future time. Otherwise, anyone
desiring a copy of a deposited work would only need to allege a speculative future dispute. Instead, the regulation repeatedly
refers to and requests information about an actual controversy between parties. This language, in context, clarifies that the
regulation requires an objective, reasonable apprehension of litigation. 4

In this case, Nintendo is likely to show that Atari had no reasonable apprehension of litigation in 1988. In fact, Atari was
not in a position to infringe before acquiring the 10NES program from the Copyright Office. Atari was Nintendo's licensee in
1988. Atari had no product, allegedly infringing or not, to perform the function of the 10NES program. Without any allegedly
infringing program at all in 1988, Atari had no reason to fear a copyright infringement suit from Nintendo. Therefore, no
controversy at all existed when Atari acquired the 10NES program from the Copyright Office. Without an actual controversy,
Atari's acquisition of

Page 842

the 10NES source code violated Copyright Office rules. Reproduction of an unauthorized copy from the Copyright Office
violates 17 U.S.C. § 106(1).

On this record, the district court did not err in determining that Nintendo is likely to show successfully that Atari infringed
the 10NES copyright by obtaining and copying the source code from the Copyright Office.

Reverse Engineering

Atari made copies of the 10NES program in its attempts to ""reverse engineer"" Nintendo's program. Atari made
intermediate copies in two very different settings. Before obtaining the Copyright Office copy of 10NES, Atari tried to
understand the program. Atari stripped some 10NES chips and copied portions of the 10NES object code from the chips. ®

After obtaining the copy of the code from the Copyright Office, Atari made other intermediate copies of the program.
Atari made photocopies of the Copyright Office copy, deprocessed chips, and hand-copied the 10NES object code from the
deprocessed chip. Atari then entered this copied 10NES object code into a computer which aided in understanding the ideas
in the program. The district court determined that this intermediate copying infringed Nintendo's copyright.

The Copyright Act encourages authors to share their creative works with society. The Constitution sets forth the
purpose of copyright protection as the promotion of ""the Progress of Science"", not the rewarding of authors. U.S. Const. art.

|, § 8, cl. 8; Feist, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 1290 ; see also, Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 546 , 105 S.Ct. at 2223 ; Sony
Corp., 464 U.S. at 429-30 , 104 S.Ct. at 782-83 ; Twentieth Century Music v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151 , 156,95 S.Ct. 2040 2044,

Copyright Act thus balances ""the interests of authors ... in the control and exploitation of their writings ... on the one hand,
and society's competing interests in the free flow of ideas, [and] information ... on the other hand."" Sony Corp., 464 U.S. at
429-30 , 104 S.Ct. at 782-83 . Thus, while providing exclusive rights to expression, the Act ""encourages others to build
reely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work."" Feist, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 1290 . The Act grants authors
enumerated exclusive rights, see 17 U.S.C. § 106, subject to limitations, see 17 U.S.C. §§ 107-112.

The author does not acquire exclusive rights to a literary work in its entirety. Under the Act, society is free to exploit
acts, ideas, processes, or methods of operation in a copyrighted work. See, e.g., Feist, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 1289-90
. To protect processes or methods of operation, a creator must look to patent laws. See Bonito Boats v. Thunder Craft Boats

489 U.S. 141 , 109 S.Ct. 971 , 103 L.Ed.2d 118 (1989) ; Arrhythmia Research, 958 F.2d at 1053 ; see also The Law &
Business of Computer Software, § 2.07 (D.C. Toedt III ed. 1991). An author cannot acquire patent-like protection by putting
an idea, process, or method of operation in an unintelligible format and asserting copyright infringement against those who
ry to understand that idea, process, or method of operation. See, e.g., Feist, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 1290 ; 17 U.S.C. §
102(b). The Copyright Act permits an individual in rightful possession of a copy of a work to undertake necessary efforts to
understand the work's ideas, processes, and methods of operation.

This permission appears in the fair use exception to copyright exclusivity. Section 107 of the Copyright Act states that
""fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies ... for purposes such as criticism, comment,
news reporting, teaching ... scholarship or research""

Page 843

is not infringement. 17 U.S.C. § 107. The legislative history of section 107 suggests that courts should adapt the fair use
exception to accommodate new technological innovations. H.R.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 66 (1976), reprinted in
U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5679-80; 17 U.S.C. § 107; see also Twentieth Century, 422 U.S. at 156 , 95 S.Ct. at 2044 (""When
technological change has rendered its literal terms ambiguous, the Copyright Act must be construed in light of [its] basic
purpose."").

Thus, the Act exempts from copyright protection reproductions for ""criticism, comment ... or research."" These activities
permit public understanding and dissemination of the ideas, processes, and methods of operation in a work:

The copyright holder has a property interest in preventing others from reaping the fruits of his labor, not in preventing the
authors and thinkers of the future from making use of, or building upon, his advances. The process of creation is often an
incremental one, and advances building on past developments are far more common than radical new concepts. See Lewis
Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo, 964 F.2d 965 (9th Cir.1992) . Where the infringement is small in relation to the new work
created, the fair user is profiting largely from his own creative efforts rather than free-riding on another's work. A prohibition
on all copying whatsoever would stifle the free flow of ideas without serving any legitimate interest of the copyright holder.

New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Publishing, 971 F.2d 302 , 307 n. 6 (9th Cir.1992). See also Harper & Row, 471
U.S. at 549 , 105 S.Ct. at 2224 (fair use implied when ""promoting progress of science and the useful arts"").

Section 107 also requires examination of the nature of the work when determining if a reproduction is a fair use. 17
U.S.C. § 107(2). When the nature of a work requires intermediate copying to understand the ideas and processes in a
copyrighted work, that nature supports a fair use for intermediate copying. Thus, reverse engineering object code to discern
the unprotectable ideas in a computer program is a fair use. See Feist, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 1290 , (""[C]opyright does
not prevent subsequent users from copying from a prior author's work those constituent elements that are not original--for
example ... facts, or materials in the public domain--as long as such use does not unfairly appropriate the author's original
contributions.""); cf. New Kids, at 307 n. 6; contra Sega Enter. v. Accolade, Inc., 785 F.Supp. 1392 , 1395-96 (N.D.Cal.1992).

Fair use to discern a work's ideas, however, does not justify extensive efforts to profit from replicating protected
expression. Subparagraphs 1 and 4 of section 107 clarify that the fair use in intermediate copying does not extend to
commercial exploitation of protected expression. Sony Corp., 464 U.S. at 451 , 104 S.Ct. at 793 . The fair use reproductions
of a computer program must not exceed what is necessary to understand the unprotected elements of the work. This limited
exception is not an invitation to misappropriate protectable expression. Any reproduction of protectable expression must be
strictly necessary to ascertain the bounds of protected information within the work.

In this case, the source code obtained from the Copyright Office facilitated Atari's intermediate copying of the 10NES
program. To invoke the fair use exception, an individual must possess an authorized copy of a literary work. See Harper &
Row, 471 U.S. at 562-63 , 105 S.Ct. at 2232 (Knowing exploitation of purloined manuscript not compatible with ""good faith""
and ""fair dealings"" underpinnings of fair use doctrine.). Because Atari was not in authorized possession of the Copyright
Office copy of 10NES, any copying or derivative copying of 1ONES source code from the Copyright Office does not qualify
as a fair use.

Reverse engineering, untainted by the purloined copy of the 10NES program and necessary to understand 10NES, is a
fair use. An individual cannot even observe, let alone understand, the object code on Nintendo's chip without reverse
engineering.


--- Page 7 ---
Page 844

Atari retrieved this object code from NES security chips in its efforts to reverse engineer the 10NES program. Atari
chemically removed layers from Nintendo's chips to reveal the 10NES object code. Through microscopic examination of the
""peeled"" chip, Atari engineers transcribed the 10NES object code into a handwritten list of ones and zeros. While these ones
and zeros represent the configuration of machine readable software, the ones and zeros convey little, if any, information to
the normal unaided observer. Atari then keyed this handwritten copy into a computer. The computer then ""disassembled"" &
the object code or otherwise aided the observer in understanding the program's method or functioning. This ""reverse
engineering"" process, to the extent untainted by the 10NES copy purloined from the Copyright Office, qualified as a fair use.

The district court assumed that reverse engineering (intermediate copying) was copyright infringement. Atari Games v.
Nintendo of Am., Nos. 88-4805, 89-0027, 89-0824, slip op. at 11-13, 1991 WL 57304 (N.D.Cal. Apr. 11, 1991). This court
disagrees. Atari did not violate Nintendo's copyright by deprocessing computer chips in Atari's rightful possession. Atari
could lawfully deprocess Nintendo's 10NES chips to learn their unprotected ideas and processes. This fair use did not give
Atari more than the right to understand the 10NES program and to distinguish the protected from the unprotected elements
of the 10NES program. Any copying beyond that necessary to understand the 10NES program was infringement. Atari could
not use reverse engineering as an excuse to exploit commercially or otherwise misappropriate protected expression.

Substantial Similarity

Even in the absence of verbatim copying, a copyright owner may show infringement ""by showing that the infringer had
access to the work and that the two works are substantially similar."" Shaw v. Lindheim, 919 F.2d 1353 , 1356 (9th Cir.1990);
accord Baxter v. MCA, Inc., 812 F.2d 421 , 423 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 954 , 108 S.Ct. 346 , 98 L.Ed.2d 372 (1987)
. This doctrine prevents a plagiarist from escaping infringement by making immaterial changes in the protected work.

The Ninth Circuit uses a two-step analysis to evaluate substantial similarity:

First, an ""extrinsic"" test is used to determine whether two ideas are substantially similar. This is an objective test which rests
upon specific criteria that can be listed and analyzed. Second, an ""intrinsic"" test is used to compare forms of expression.
This is a subjective test which depends on the response of the ordinary reasonable person.

Data East, 862 F.2d at 208 (citations omitted). In the context of computer programs, the ""ordinary reasonable person""
with the ability to intelligently respond to computer expression is a computer programmer. Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at
1176 n. 4. Thus, in addition to the lay response of a fact-finder, the Ninth Circuit permits expert testimony about the second
prong of the substantial similarity test. Cf., Brown Bag, 960 F.2d at 1474 n. 3 (acknowledging movement toward test ""in
which lay and expert testimony are uniformly admissible"" in computer copyright cases).

In applying this test, the district court correctly considered expert testimony recounting striking similarities between the
Rabbit and 10NES programs. Moreover, the trial court detected similarities between the programs beyond the similarities
necessary to accommodate the programming environment, or similarities necessary to embody

Page 845
the unprotectable idea, process, or method of the 10NES program.

Specifically, the district court noted that the Rabbit program incorporates elements of the 10NES program unnecessary
for the chip's performance. The 10NES slave chip performs some functions beyond unlocking the NES console. For
example, the 10NES slave chip shuts down upon receipt of an erroneous message from a master chip. The Rabbit program
too contains this feature. This disabling feature is unnecessary to achieve Atari's stated purpose--unlocking the NES
console.

In another example, the district court noted that Nintendo modified its 10NES slave chip program in 1987. This
modification deleted some instructions from the original 1ONES program. Nonetheless the Rabbit program contains
instructions equivalent to those deleted from the original 1ONES program. These unnecessary instructions strongly suggest
that the Rabbit program is substantially similar to the 10NES program. See, e.g., M. Kramer Mfg. Co. v. Andrews, 783 F.2d
421 , 446 (4th Cir.1986) (""Courts have consistently viewed 'common errors' as strongest evidence of copying.""); E.F.
Johnson Co. v. Uniden Corp. of Am., 623 F.Supp. 1485 , 1496 (D.Minn.1985) (""The existence of the identical unnecessary
instructions in both codes is strong proof of substantial similarity.""); SAS Inst. v. S & H Computer Sys., 605 F.Supp. 816 ,
824, 826 (M.D.Tenn.1985) (inclusion of unnecessary statement ""explained only as a result of slavish copying of structural
detail"").

While Atari may freely reproduce the idea or process of Nintendo's 10NES code, copying of fully extraneous
instructions unnecessary to the 10NES program's function strongly supports the district court's imposition of an injunction on
the likelihood Nintendo will show infringement. The unnecessary instructions in the Rabbit program suggest copying, not
independent creation. As Judge Learned Hand said, ""No plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his work
he did not pirate."" Sheldon v. Metro Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 81 F.2d 49 , 56 (2d Cir.), cert. denied,298 U.S. 669 , 56 S.Ct.
835 , 80 L.Ed. 1392 (1936) . Atari argued that incorporation of the unnecessary instructions was necessary to insure future
compatibility. The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow Atari to rely on speculative future events to
justify inclusion of unnecessary 10NES program elements in the Rabbit program.

In sum, Nintendo is likely to show that its 10ONES program contains protectable expression. Atari's efforts to reverse


--- Page 8 ---
engineer the 10NES chip to learn the ideas in the program will not alone support a copyright infringement claim. To the
extent, however, Nintendo is likely to show misappropriation and copying of the unauthorized Copyright Office copy, it is
likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim. Alternatively, Nintendo is likely to prove substantial similarity
between the Rabbit and 10NES programs sufficient to support its infringement claims. This record thus justifies the trial
court's imposition of a preliminary injunction.

Copyright Misuse

As a defense to copyright infringement, Atari asserts Nintendo has misused its copyright of the lockout program. Atari
alleges Nintendo has conditioned the license of its copyrighted lockout program on the acceptance of contract provisions
that give it control over the games developed by independent, third-party software developers. The standard license
exclusivity provision Nintendo includes in its contracts provides:

Exclusivity: LICENSEE agrees to sell the Licensed Products for use only in conjunction with the NES. For a period of
two (2) years following the date of first sale by LICENSEE of any Licensed Products pertaining to any particular video game
program developed by LICENSEE under this Agreement, LICENSEE will not adapt or offer such video game program or any
derivatives of such video game program, for use in any: (a) other home video system; or, (b) home computer system....

Page 846

The district court granted Nintendo's motion for preliminary injunction in response to which Atari asserted the copyright
misuse defense. Atari contends Nintendo's copyright misuse should prevent copyright enforcement. The district court did not
discuss copyright misuse in its order granting the preliminary injunction. However, on Atari's earlier motion for summary
judgment, the court held, as a matter of law, that Nintendo did not misuse its copyright:

The record does not demonstrate, as a matter of law, that such restrictions restrain the creativity of Nintendo licensees and
thereby thwart the intent of the patent and copyright laws.

Atari Games v. Nintendo of Am., Nos. 88-4805, 89-0027, slip op. at 5-6, 1991 WL 57304 (N.D.Cal. Mar. 5, 1991).

In its opinion, the district court raised questions about the origin of a copyright misuse defense. Once again, this court
applies Ninth Circuit law. Sun Studs v. Applied Theory Assoc., 772 F.2d 1557 , 1560-61 (Fed.Cir.1985).

Several circuit courts, including the Ninth Circuit, have entertained defenses of copyright misuse. Lasercomb Am. v.
Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970 (4th Cir.1990) ; United Tel. Co. v. Johnson Publishing Co., 855 F.2d 604 , 610-12 (8th Cir.1988);
Supermarket of Homes v. San Fernando Valley Bd. of Realtors, 786 F.2d 1400 , 1408 (9th Cir.1986); F.E.L. Publications v.
Catholic Bishop, 214 U.S.P.Q. 409 , 413 (7th Cir.), cert. denied,459 U.S. 859 , 103 S.Ct. 131 , 74 L.Ed.2d 113 (1982) ;
Edward B. Marks Music v. Colorado Magnetics, 497 F.2d 285 , 290 (10th Cir.1974), cert. denied,419 U.S. 1120 , 95 S.Ct.
801 , 42 L.Ed.2d 819 (1975) ; Broadcast Music v. Moor-Law, 527 F.Supp. 758 , 772 (D.Del.1981), aff'd without opinion, 691
F.2d 490 (3rd Cir.1982) ; Mitchell Bros. Film Group v. Cinema Adult Theater, 604 F.2d 852 , 865 (5th Cir.1979), cert. denied,
445 U.S. 917 , 100 S.Ct. 1277 , 63 L.Ed.2d 601 (1980) . Only one circuit has sustained the defense. Lasercomb, 911 F.2d at
970 . Although no Ninth Circuit case has applied the defense to prevent enforcement of a copyright infringement claim, the
Ninth Circuit suggests that, under the appropriate factual setting, copyright misuse may be a viable defense against a claim
of copyright infringement. Supermarket of Homes, 786 F.2d at 1408 ; see also, Sega Enter., at 1399.

Although it has yet to apply the copyright misuse defense, the United States Supreme Court has given at least tacit
approval of the defense. United States v. Loew's, Inc., 371 U.S. 38 , 83 S.Ct. 97 , 9 L.Ed.2d 11 (1962) . In Loew's, the Court
applied principles of patent misuse to a patentee's unlawful tying arrangements and held that recovery for infringement
should be denied. The Court then went on to apply, with reference to the copyrights, the same antitrust restrictions on tie-in
of sales. Numerous cases suggest that the purpose and policy of patent misuse apply as well to copyright. See, e.g., Sony
Corp., 464 U.S. at 439 , 104 S.Ct. at 787 ; Loew's, 371 U.S. at 44-51 , 83 S.Ct. at 101-05 ; United States v. Paramount
Pictures, 334 U.S. 131 , 157-59, 68 S.Ct. 915 , 929-30, 92 L.Ed. 1260 (1948) ; Mitchell Bros., 604 F.2d at 865 ; Bellsouth,
933 F.2d at 960-61 .

In the absence of any statutory entitlement to a copyright misuse defense, however, the defense is solely an equitable
doctrine. Any party seeking equitable relief must come to the court with ""clean hands."" Keystone Driller Co. v. General
Excavator Co., 290 U.S. 240 , 245,54 S.Ct. 146 , 147, 78 L.Ed. 293 (1933) . The Ninth Circuit has noted that the doctrine of
unclean hands can also preclude the defense of copyright misuse. Supermarket of Homes, 786 F.2d at 1408 . The district
court states, ""Atari lied to the Copyright Office in order to obtain the copyrighted 10NES program."" Atari Games v. Nintendo
of Am., Nos. 88-4805, 89-0027, 89-0824, slip op. at 14, 1991 WL 57304 (N.D.Cal. Apr. 11, 1991). This record supports the
district court's conclusion and suggests that Atari's unclean hands prevent it from invoking equity. Thus, even if the Ninth
Circuit permits an equitable copyright misuse defense, Atari appears ineligible to invoke the defense. This court discerns no
reversible error in the district

Page 847
court's assessment of Nintendo's likelihood of success on the merits of its copyright infringement claim.
CONCLUSION

The district court did not err by granting Nintendo's request for a preliminary injunction. Nintendo is likely to prove that


--- Page 9 ---
the 10NES program contains protected expression. Nintendo is also likely to prove that Atari made unauthorized verbatim
copies of the 10NES program. On this record, the district court did not err in determining that Nintendo is likely to show
successfully that Atari infringed the 10NES copyright by obtaining and copying the source code from the Copyright Office.
Furthermore, Nintendo is likely to prove that Atari's Rabbit program is substantially similar to the 10NES program and that
the similarities relate to protected expression. Nintendo is also likely to overcome Atari's assertion of copyright misuse as a
defense. Atari presents no arguments to rebut the presumption of irreparable harm that arises upon a showing of likelihood
of success on the merits.

1 Object code is machine readable, binary code, represented on paper as a series of ones and zeroes. In actuality, those ones and zeroes represent ""on""
and ""off"" states of switches on a computer chip. In the 10NES chips, the object code, contained in chip memories, is implemented when the chips are
operational. When operational, the chips generate a series of ""ons"" and ""offs"" in a particular sequence. That results in a pulsating signal which conveys
messages to the computer.

The Copyright Office has recently become aware that an attorney completing the previous Litigation Statement form provided by the Office could
generally allege that a controversy existed when in fact no real controversy did exist. An attorney could thus receive reproductions of deposits not
authorized by the regulations. The Litigation Statement form has been amended to require the applicant to give more specific information regarding
prospective proceedings and to include supporting documentation.

S.Ct. 774 , 787, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (appropriate to refer to patent case law in copyright cases ""because of the historic kinship between patent law and
copyright law""). In the patent declaratory judgment context, a two-prong analysis defines an actual controversy. Spectronics Corp. v. H.B. Fuller Co., 940
F.2d 631 , 634 (Fed.Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 658 , 116 L.Ed.2d 749 (1991) . First, an alleged patent infringer must have infringed or be in
a position to infringe. Id. Second, the patentee's ""conduct must create an objectively reasonable apprehension on the part of the accused infringer that
the patent holder will initiate suit if the allegedly infringing activity continues."" Id.

5 The Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 permits, in some limited circumstances, reverse engineering to reproduce a mask work. 17 U.S.C. §
906 (1988). This Act, while supporting reverse engineering to help disseminate the ideas embodied in a mask work, does not apply in this case. Atari did
not reproduce or copy Nintendo's chip or mask work. In fact, Atari used an entirely different chip. Atari instead allegedly copied the program on
Nintendo's chip. Therefore, the 1984 Act does not apply.

6 Computer programs are normally written in a high-level language such as C or FORTRAN. Once written, the program is translated from the high-level
language to machine-readable object code. This translation process, called compiling, is performed by a computer as instructed by a compiling program.
As mentioned previously, the idea or process expressed in a program is not easily discernible from object code. Object code is disassembled to facilitate
understanding the idea or process expressed. Disassembly is basically the reverse of compilation. Object code is translated via a disassembly program
to a higher, more intelligible language called assembly language.

[623 F.Supp.3d 77]

Plaintiffs Taje Monbo and Deafueh Monbo, proceeding pro se, !commenced the above-captioned action on October 23,
2018, and filed an Amended Complaint on August 29, 2019, against Defendants Lotfy Nathan, Red Gap Film Group, LLC
(""Red Gap""), and Vertical Entertainment, LLC (""Vertical Entertainment"") (collectively, the ""Nathan Defendants"");
Oscilloscope Pictures, Inc., Oscilloscope Inc. (""Oscilloscope""), Daniel Berger, and Thomas Sladek (together, the
""Oscilloscope Defendants""); Overbrook Entertainment, Inc., Overbrook Entertainment, LLC, Willard Carroll Smith, Jr., and
Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (collectively, the ""SPE Defendants""); and Maria Mochin (both individually and doing
business as Mission Film Productions), Mission Film, Inc., and Eric Blair. (Compl., Docket Entry No. 1; Am. Compl., Docket
Entry No. 98.) Plaintiffs allege that the Nathan Defendants' 2013 documentary about an aspiring dirt-bike rider in Baltimore,
itled ""12 O'Clock Boys"" (the ""2013 Documentary""), and the SPE Defendants' upcoming feature film based on it (the ""Feature
Film"") infringe their copyrights on their 2001 film ""12 O'Clock Boyz"" (the ""2001 Documentary"") and 2003 sequel ""12 O'Clock
Boyz: The Paparazzi Edition"" (the ""2003 Documentary""), featuring the 12 O'Clock Boyz dirt-bike stunt group. Plaintiffs also
claim infringement of Taje Monbo's right of publicity, unjust enrichment, and violations of the Lanham Act and related
Maryland trademark law and seek declaratory judgments invalidating the Nathan Defendants’ copyrights and declaring that
he SPE Defendants' Feature Film infringes their copyrights. (Am. Compl.)

Currently before the Court are the Nathan and Oscilloscope Defendants' (collectively, the ""Joint Moving Defendants"") motion
0 dismiss the Amended Complaint, which the Court has converted into a summary judgment motion; 2 Plaintiffs’ motion to
strike the Oscilloscope Defendants from the joint motion and to strike their counterclaims; 2the SPE Defendants’ motion to
dismiss the Amended Complaint; 4 and Plaintiffs' motions for default judgment against Mission Film Productions and Mission

623 F.Supp.3d 78]

Film, Inc. £For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion to strike, grants the Joint Moving Defendants’
summary judgment motion and the SPE Defendants' motion to dismiss, and denies Plaintiffs' default judgment motions. &

I. Background

Plaintiffs are the owners and creators of the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries, which depict the 12 O'Clock Boyz, a group of
urban dirt-bike riders in Baltimore, Maryland. 2(Am. Compl. 9 1, 18-19.) In 2013, the Joint Moving Defendants, together
with Blair, Mission Film, Inc., Mission Film Productions, and Mochin released the allegedly infringing 2013 Documentary,
entitled ""12 O'Clock Boys."" ( /d. ¢ 2.) The SPE Defendants adapted the 2013 Documentary into the Feature Film, which
Plaintiffs allege also infringes upon their intellectual property by borrowing ""the characters, concepts, feel, and mood"" of
Plaintiffs' works. 8 ( Id. 44 6, 9.)

a. 2001 and 2003 Documentaries

For the 2001 Documentary, Taje Monbo ""organize[d] a group of highly skilled dirt-bike riders"" to participate in a scripted film
""that would highlight the exploits of an ostentatious group of dirt-bike riders in Baltimore called 12 O'Clock Boyz."" ( Id. 44 36-
39.) Taje Monbo coined the phrase 12 O'Clock Boyz ""to describe the way in which riders would elevate the front of their
bikes and ride only on the back wheels until their bikes would be perpendicular to the road or in the '12 O'Clock’ position."" (
Id. ¢ 40.) The 2001 Documentary ""sold 50,000 copies in two weeks and revolutionized the Baltimore dirt-bike culture."" ( Id. J
47.) Plaintiffs also released the 2003 Documentary, created the 12 O'Clock Boyz logo and associated ""visual artworks"" in
which they hold copyrights, and plan to make a third film in the series. ( /d. {§ 48, 51-53.) Plaintiffs have used the 12
O'Clock

[623 F.Supp.3d 79]


--- Page 4 ---
Boyz trademarks since 2001 and formally registered the marks in 2016. 2( /d. 44 56-60.)
b. The 2013 Documentary

Nathan directed the 2013 Documentary, which allegedly infringes on Plaintiffs’ 2001 and 2003 Documentaries. ( /d. § 69.)
Plaintiffs contend that Nathan's online fundraising campaign page states that Nathan first conceived of this film in 2008 after
meeting a member of the Wildout Wheelie Boyz, another Baltimore dirt-bike group. 12( /d. ¢§ 70-84.) The 2013 Documentary
""tells the story of Pug, a thirteen-year-old child who wants to be a '12 O'Clock Boy,’ just like [he] has repeatedly watched in
[the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries]."" ( /d. 4 85.) Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Moving Defendants took aspects of Plaintiffs’
work, including ""the character Pug, clips, the title card, concepts, feel, mood, theme, and approach."" ( /d. ¢§ 89, 112.)

Plaintiffs contend that seventeen minutes into the 2013 Documentary, the title card from their 2001 film appears, followed by
""upward of thirty"" excerpts from Plaintiffs’ films taken without permission. ( /d. 44 3, 125.) Taje Monbo appeared as an actor
in the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries, was interviewed in ""[a]t least two"" of the segments that the Joint Moving Defendants
used, and was not compensated for the use of his likeness. ( /d. 4 5.) Plaintiffs contend that the clips and excerpts used
were substantial and formed the ""heart"" of Plaintiffs’ film. ( /d. § 116.) In addition, Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Moving
Defendants took scenes from ""all of the seven chapters found in Plaintiffs' film"" and used editing tools to compress scenes
that constituted ""about 70% or more of"" the 2001 Documentary into minutes of footage that then appeared in the 2013
Documentary. 1+( /d. {§ 117-118.)

Plaintiffs contend that there are several similarities between the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries and the 2013 Documentary.
Like the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries, the 2013 Documentary is ""docu-fiction,"" or ""documentary mixed with fictional
elements,"" ( id. at 29), and both are set in Baltimore, ( id. at 27). Both the 2001 Documentary and the 2013 Documentary
begin with a news clip used ""[t]o give [the] feel of a documentary"": the 2001 Documentary begins with ""actual news footage
from a Baltimore TV News segment"" about the riders and the 2013 Documentary starts with the voice of ""a real radio host."" (
Id. at 30.) Both the 2001 Documentary and 2013 Documentary include interviews with people sitting on the front steps of a
house, transitions from riding scenes to interview scenes, a clip of the 12 O'Clock Boyz riding down the street, slow-motion
shots of the riders, film of the riders from a moving vehicle, and the 12 O'Clock Boyz themselves. ( /d. at 31-33.) Both
incorporate the theme of death: the 2001 Documentary pays respect to a rider, ""Buck,"" who passed away during filming, and
the 2013 Documentary discusses Pug's brother, Tibba,

[623 F.Supp.3d 80]

who passed away during filming of that work. ( /d. at 31.) In addition, ""Pug"" appeared with his hat turned backwards in the
2001 Documentary and in the 2013 Documentary. ( /d. at 28.) Taje Monbo choreographed scenes of the 12 O'Clock Boyz
riding in formation that are similar to a scene used on the DVD cover of the 2013 Documentary. ( /d. at 35.) The 2013
Documentary has been shown at film festivals and on cable networks and is available for streaming and purchase online. (
Id. at 46-48.)

Plaintiffs also contend that more than 100 riders appear in the 2013 Documentary, but none of them (besides those depicted
in excerpts from the 2001 Documentary) are 12 O'Clock Boyz members. ( /d. ]§ 66-68.) In addition, the design of the title of
the 2013 Documentary is similar to Plaintiffs' trademarked 12 O'Clock Boyz logo. ( /d. at 35; id. ¥§ 102-104.) The Joint
Moving Defendants also registered a website under the domain name 12oclockboys.com, where they promote and sell the
2013 Documentary. ( /d. § 107.) Plaintiffs contend that the Joint Moving Defendants’ actions constitute trademark
infringement, unfair competition, and dilution of the distinctiveness and value of Plaintiffs’ mark. ( /d. 44 105-109.)

On October 20, 2014, Plaintiffs, through counsel, directed Nathan, Oscilloscope, and Red Gap to cease and desist
distribution and public performance of the 2013 Documentary. ( /d. § 92.) Plaintiffs contend that despite this letter, the Joint
Moving Defendants have knowingly continued to violate Plaintiffs' rights. ( /d. 44 93, 110.)

Plaintiffs contend that Red Gap's copyright registration for the 2013 Documentary is invalid because it includes ""omissions,
inaccurate information, and materials misstatements that if known, would have caused the Register of Copyrights to refuse
Red Gap's copyright application."" ( /d. 4 190.) Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Nathan knowingly misrepresented that the
2013 Documentary ""did not include pre-existing materials"" from Plaintiffs’ 2001 and 2003 Documentaries, and that although
the copyright registration ""states that Red Gap is the author"" of the 2013 Documentary, Red Gap did not exist when the
2013 Documentary was being produced and was therefore not entitled to claim authorship under the ""work for hire"" doctrine.
(Id. 49 177-191.)

In addition, Plaintiffs contend that Vertical Entertainment's copyright registration in six DVDs Nathan produced in 2008
entitled ""The Twelve O'Clock Boyz"" (the ""2008 DVDs"") is invalid because Nathan identified Vertical Entertainment as one of
the authors of the 2008 DVDs, but Vertical Entertainment did not exist when the 2008 DVDs were produced and therefore is
not entitled to claim authorship of them under the ""work for hire"" doctrine. 12( Id. ¢{ 192-201.)

Plaintiffs seek disgorgement of profits attributable to infringement and an order directing the Joint Moving Defendants to
cease and desist infringing activity. ( /d. 4 11.)


--- Page 5 ---
c. The Feature Film

Plaintiffs contend that the SPE Defendants adapted the Feature Film based on the 2013 Documentary and, as a result,
Plaintiffs sent Overbrook Entertainment, LLC and Smith cease-and-desist letters

[623 F.Supp.3d 81]

concerning the Feature Film. ( /d. 129-131.) Plaintiffs contend that while the SPE Defendants disclaimed any intent ""to
produce a motion picture with the title 12 O'Clock Boys,"" ( id. 134), they nevertheless filmed a script in Baltimore with the
following plot:

Mouse wants nothing more than to be a part of the Midnight Clique, a tough group of Baltimore bike riders, who
rule the summertime streets. As he navigates the challenges of coming of age in a complicated world, he learns
the hard way that the choices you make early on can change your life forever.

(/d. ¥ 139.) Plaintiffs allege that the 2013 Documentary and the Feature Film have several similarities: (1) Pug in the 2013
Documentary, like Mouse in the Feature Film, wants to be a veterinarian but also wants to join a group of dirt-bike riders; (2)
both feature skilled dirt-bike riders; and (3) both are set in Baltimore. ( /d. at 43.)

In addition, Plaintiffs contend that the SPE Defendants have used Plaintiffs’ mark to promote their work, creating consumer
confusion, by (1) creating or authorizing the creation of a Wikipedia page titled ""12 O'Clock Boys (upcoming film)""; (2)
creating or authorizing the creation of a page on the Internet Movie Database (""IMDB"") listing Plaintiffs' mark as the working
title for their adaptation; (3) authorizing the promotion of their film using Twitter and other social media platforms; and (4)
using the mark ""Twelve,"" a ""colorable imitation of Plaintiffs’ registered 12 O'Clock Boyz mark,"" to promote their film. ( /d. 14
148-159.)

d. Plaintiffs’ claims

Plaintiffs allege that: (1) Defendants have infringed and continue to infringe Plaintiffs' copyrights in the 2001 and 2003
Documentaries; (2) Defendants committed contributory copyright infringement by contributing to the unauthorized
preparation of the 2013 Documentary and the Feature Film; (3) Defendants committed vicarious copyright infringement
because they had the right and ability to supervise each other in the preparation of the 2013 Documentary and the Feature
Film; (4) the Joint Moving Defendants infringed on Taje Monbo's right of publicity by republishing segments that feature him
being interviewed in the 2013 Documentary; (5) Defendants committed trademark infringement, false designation of origin,
passing off, and unfair competition in violation of the Lanham Act by using Plaintiffs’ 12 O'Clock Boyz mark in connection
with the 2013 Documentary and the Feature Film; (6) Defendants committed trademark dilution in violation of the Lanham
Act by misidentifying and casting riders as ""12 O'Clock Boyz"" in the 2013 Documentary and the Feature Film; (7) the Joint
Moving Defendants committed cybersquatting in violation of the Lanham Act by using a domain name that is confusingly
similar to Plaintiffs' mark; and Defendants' actions also constitute (8) trademark infringement in violation of Maryland Code
Business Regulation § 1-414 et seq. ; (9) trademark infringement, false advertising, and unfair competition under the
Maryland common law; (10) contributory and vicarious trademark infringement in violation of federal law and the Maryland
common law; and (11) unjust enrichment. ( /d. {| 206-270.)

Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgments invalidating the Nathan Defendants’ copyright registrations for the 2013 Documentary
and for the related 2008 DVDs; a declaratory judgment that the SPE Defendants’ Feature Film infringes on their copyright;
declaratory and injunctive relief as to the use of the 12 O'Clock Boyz mark; disgorgement of profits; and damages, among
other relief. ( /d. at 69-79.)

[623 F.Supp.3d 82]
e. The Court's review of the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries

The Court has reviewed copies of the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries. (2001 Documentary and 2003 Documentary, annexed
to Decl. of Robert Meloni in Supp. of Defs.' Joint Mot. to Dismiss as Ex. A, Docket Entry No. 119.) 48

i. The 2001 Documentary

The 2001 Documentary, which is thirty-four minutes and seven seconds long, begins with a title screen that reads ""12
O'CLOCK BOYZ INC. presents THE OFFICIAL 12 O'CLOCK BOYZ,"" followed by a shot of a man riding a four-wheeler down
a city street, front wheels in the air. (2001 Documentary 00:01-00:40.) A newscaster's voice plays over the scene, stating
""it's the stunt every four-wheeler rider wants to master."" ( /d. at 00:47-00:51.) Another voice then states, ""[t]hem boys all day,
they ride twelve o'clock all day. Twelve o'clock is when you got the bike straight up in the air,"" followed by clips of two- and
four-wheel vehicles riding on the street with their front wheels up in the air at a steep angle. ( /d. at 00:51-00:56.) A series of
dirt-bike riders then appear in short interviews in which they speak about their riding prowess, ( id. at 2:38, 3:50, 25:52-
26:27), and perform stunts shot in grainy black-and-white or color film, ( id. at 00:57-2:38).

Riders perform on-road stunts that receive extended camera time. ( /d. at 4:27-6:33, 7:30, 19:00-20:20, 26:28-31:05.) One
member boasts ""we twelve anything,"" lists a series of vehicles by way of example, and then proceeds to ride around a street
on a bicycle with the front wheel removed. ( /d. at 7:47-9:48.) The film also shows a series of crashes. ( /d. at 16:40-17:34.)


--- Page 6 ---
Later in the film, viewers learn that the 12 O'Clock Boyz are one of several dirt-bike
[623 F.Supp.3d 83]

groups in Baltimore. One rival group is the Wildout Wheelie Boyz. A narrator points out an isolated Wildout Wheelie Boyz
member riding on a busy street and expresses doubt about his riding abilities, predicting that he will be unable to turna
corner with his bike in the twelve o'clock position. Others criticize riders from what appears to be a different group, who are
not attempting the twelve o'clock or ""wheelie"" position, by pointing out that they have helmets and leather suits, but ""y'all
won't wheelie a bike."" ( /d. at 11:18-11:57, 12:19-12:32.) As to another group — referred to as ""Wing-Worm"" — whose
members are pictured riding off the road, an interviewee proclaims, ""you can't be no twelve o'clock boy [if] you ridin’ around
in the mud."" ( /d. at 15:34-15:38.) Twelve O'Clock Boyz are specifically those who ride on the streets — ""control and balance
is what mak[es] a Twelve O'Clock Boy totally different."" ( /d. at 22:50.) Anyone who shows sufficient riding ability — even
members of rival groups — can become a Twelve O'Clock Boy. ( /d. at 20:30.) The 2001 Documentary closes with a tribute
to Buck, a departed teammate. ( /d. at 31:45.)

The 2001 Documentary consists of a loosely connected series of stunts performed by the 12 O'Clock Boyz, interspersed
with statements by members about their riding prowess. ( /d. at 17:26-17:40, 21:41:21-50, 22:47-23:35.) A member of the
group explains that people can join and that the lone white member, nicknamed ""White Boy,"" was recruited. ( /d. at 21:05-
21:16.)

ii. The 2003 Documentary

The 2003 Documentary is forty-two minutes and thirty-six seconds long. (2003 Documentary.) Like the 2001 Documentary, it
begins with dirt-bike stunts, some of which are clips from the 2001 Documentary, ( id. at 00:53-4:11), and features stunts
heavily throughout the remainder of the documentary, ( see, e.g., id. at 6:12-9:06, 11:07-11:33, 14:11-15:38, 20:16-20:27,
23:54-25:10, 30:42-34:37). A group of young boys cheer on the 12 O'Clock Boyz, ( id. at 6:12), and one rider is briefly shown
with a child on his bike, ( id. at 6:30). Two 12 O'Clock Boyz members, Moe-Town and Pee-Wee, comment on the success of
their 2001 Documentary, which they state sold 50,000 copies in two weeks, ( id. at 4:20-5:23), on the stunts they perform,
and on what makes a good rider, ( id. at 9:07-11:06). Like the 2001 Documentary, the 2003 Documentary is a collection of
scenes, primarily including stunts by and interviews with 12 O'Clock Boyz members. The 2003 Documentary features an
individual named ""Pug"" in the group of riders and in the credits. ( /d. at 21:03.)

f. The 2013 Documentary

The Court has reviewed a copy of the 2013 Documentary. (2013 Documentary, annexed to Decl. of Robert Meloni in Supp.
of Defs.' Joint Mot. as Ex. B, Docket Entry No. 119.) The 2013 Documentary is one hour, fifteen minutes, and twenty
seconds long and follows a boy named ""Pug"" for three years, starting just before his thirteenth birthday, as he aspires to join
a group of dirt-bike riders in Baltimore. (2013 Documentary 4:27-4:32.)

Pug mourns his older brother Tibba, who died from an asthma attack after filming began. ( /d. at 22:52-23:08.) He describes
how Tibba often watched the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries with him and explains that those documentaries, which
featured ""the legends,"" fueled his aspiration to join the 12 O'Clock Boyz. ( /d. at 15:29-16:13.) The 2013 Documentary then
shows clips from the 2001 Documentary, including a scene of the title card from the 2001 Documentary, all together totaling
seventy-seven seconds. ( /d. at 16:02-16:13, 16:53-16:55.) A voiceover describes how ""you had to have a copy"" of the tape
when

[623 F.Supp.3d 84]

it came out. ( /d. at 17:30-17:50.) The same narrator states that approximately a dozen riders took part in the 2001 and 2003
Documentaries, ( id. at 17:53-18:03), and today, perhaps a hundred riders are active. The narrator attributes the growth of
dirt-bike riding to the popularity of the 2001 Documentary, riders' newfound ability to become popular on YouTube, and the
work of first-generation dirt-bike riders in popularizing the sport. ( /d. ) In addition to those excerpts from the 2001
Documentary, the 2013 Documentary includes more than five minutes of newly filmed footage of dirt-bike riders performing
stunts, including in slow motion, both with and without Pug watching. ( See, e.g., id. at 2:40-3:24.)

The 2013 Documentary also chronicles Pug's life and aspirations outside dirt-bike riding. It discusses his aspiration to
become a veterinarian and the challenges of his academic career, including his suspension from school for fighting and his
chronic truancy, which his mother, Coco, is called to court to address at one point. ( /d. at 14:33-15:00, 27:14-27:44, 42:14-
42:27, 58:28-59:00.)

The 2013 Documentary begins with footage of Pug in a van at night. A male radio host narrates over the opening shot,
harshly criticizing ""these little scumbags on these dirt bikes in our downtown."" ( /d. at 00:15-00:54.) Pug is shown riding ina
car while capturing footage of riders and is also shown watching older boys ride dirt bikes in the park with a look of awe on
his face. 44( /d. at 0:55-2:37.)

The 2013 Documentary features Pug's voice throughout in interviews and narration, but also features comments from a rider


--- Page 7 ---
identified by the name ""Superman,"" who remembers the loss of a promising young dirt-bike rider during a police chase, and
a conversation with former Baltimore police officer Lemon, whose actions allegedly contributed to that rider's death. ( /d. at
48:38-51:00 (Superman says ""Lemon bumped his back wheel, and he went into this black sedan"").) At the time the
documentary was filmed, police officers were discouraged from chasing riders, ( id. at 50:51-50:55), but pursuit and other
conflicts with the police nevertheless occurred, ( id. at 33:00-33:20, 35:00-35:55). Officer Lemon notes that riding can be
dangerous, ( id. at 48:26-48:37 (""I believe that we lose at least ten, fifteen lives each summer, in reference to dirt bikes.""),
51:00-51:07 (""[T]he act of them riding around, doing wheelies at high speed, is a violent act in itself."")), but Superman
describes the dirt-bike groups as ""one of the first [and only] things you see that's positive"" in his impoverished Baltimore
neighborhood, ( id. at 13:33-13:58, 28:59-29:45). A former rider who knows Pug agrees: ""[e]very city has a Pug, every hood
has a Pug. This is what the ghetto produces."" ( /d. at 1:08:44-1:09:00.)

Il. Discussion
a. Standards of review
i. Rule 12(b)(6)

In reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court must construe the
complaint liberally, ""accepting all factual allegations therein as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs’
favor."" Sacerdote v. N.Y. Univ., 9 F.4th 95 , 106-07 (2d Cir. 2021); Vaughn v. Phoenix House N.Y. Inc., 957 F.3d 141 , 145
(2d Cir. 2020). A complaint must plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atl. Corp. v.

[623 F.Supp.3d 85]

Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 , 570,127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) ; Bacon v. Phelps, 961 F.3d 533 , 540 (2d Cir. 2020)
(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 ). A claim is plausible ""when the plaintiff pleads factual content that
allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Matson v. Bd. of
Educ., 631 F.3d 57 , 63 (2d Cir. 2011) (quotingAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868

legal conclusions."" /qbal, 556 U.S. at 678 , 129 S.Ct. 1937 ; Vaughn, 957 F.3d at 145 (same).

In reviewing a pro se complaint, a court must be mindful that a plaintiff's pleadings must be held ""to less stringent standards
than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers."" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89 , 94,127 S.Ct. 2197 , 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007)

572 F.3d 66 , 72 (2d Cir. 2009) (noting that even after Twombly, courts ""remain obligated to construe a pro se complaint
liberally"").

Summary judgment is proper only when ""there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Borley v. United States, 22 F.4th 75 , 78 (2d Cir. 2021); Windward Bora
LLC v. Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc'y, 982 F.3d 139 , 142 (2d Cir. 2020). The court must ""constru[e] the evidence in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party"" and ""resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of
the party against whom summary judgment is sought."" Lenzi v. Systemax, Inc., 944 F.3d 97 , 107 (2d Cir. 2019) (first quoting
VKK Corp. v. Nat'l Football Leaque, 244 F.3d 114 , 118 (2d Cir. 2001); and then quotingJohnson v. Goord, 445 F.3d 532 ,
534 (2d Cir. 2006)). The role of the court ""is not to resolve disputed questions of fact but only to determine whether, as to
any material issue, a genuine factual dispute exists."" Rogoz v. City of Hartford, 796 F.3d 236 , 245 (2d Cir. 2015) (first
quoting_Kaytor v. Elec. Boat Corp., 609 F.3d 537 , 545 (2d Cir. 2010); and then citingAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.. 477
U.S. 242 , 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) ). A genuine issue of fact exists when there is sufficient ""evidence
on which the jury could reasonably find for the [nonmoving party]."" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252 , 106 S.Ct. 2505 . The ""mere
existence of a scintilla of evidence"" is not sufficient to defeat summary judgment. /d. The court's function is to decide
""whether, after resolving all ambiguities and drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, a rational juror could find
in favor of that party."" Pinto v. Allstate Ins. Co., 221 F.3d 394 , 398 (2d Cir. 2000).

In reviewing a motion for summary judgment involving a pro se litigant, ""special solicitude should be afforded."" Gachette v.

b. The Joint Moving Defendants’ summary judgment motion

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ (1) copyright claims (a) fail as a matter of law because the works are not
substantially similar, and (b) even if the 2013 and 2001 Documentaries are similar under the alternative ""fragmented literal
similarity"" test, the Joint Moving Defendants’ use of excerpts from the 2001 Documentary is fair use, (2) right of publicity and
unjust enrichment claims are preempted under the Copyright Act, (3) Lanham Act and state trademark claims fail on the
merits, (4) declaratory judgment claims fail as a matter of law, (5) claims are time-barred ""in whole or in significant part,"" and
(6) failure to join necessary parties requires dismissal pursuant to Rule 19. 12 (Defs.' Joint Mem.)

i. The Court dismisses Plaintiff's copyright claims

Plaintiffs' claims of direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement fail for several reasons: (1) they are time-barred;
(2) Plaintiff's direct copyright infringement claims fail because the 2013 Documentary is not substantially similar to the 2001
and 2003 Documentaries under the standard test and, even if the 2013 Documentary is substantially similar to the 2001
Documentary under the fragmented literal similarity test due its use of clips from the 2001 Documentary, Plaintiffs’ claim with
respect to this documentary is barred by the fair use doctrine; and (3) because Plaintiffs’ claims of direct infringement

[623 F.Supp.3d 87]
fail, their claims of contributory and vicarious infringement also fail.
1. Plaintiff's copyright claims against the Joint Moving Defendants are time-barred

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs ""cannot recover damages on their copyright infringement claims for any
purported infringements occurring prior to October 23, 2015,"" and their claims are therefore time-barred because they
accrued ""no later than the October 20, 2014, date of their attorney's letter"" to these Defendants. (Defs.' Joint Mem. 49.)

Plaintiffs argue that ""[a]t least some"" of their claims are timely because they have alleged continuing infringement and
provided ""website links and supporting exhibits as proof that the infringement occurred as late as 2019."" (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.'
Joint Mot. 10.)

A copyright infringement claim must be brought ""within three years after the claim accrued."" 17 U.S.C. § 507(b). ""A copyright
claim ... arises or 'accrue[s]' when an infringing act occurs."" Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 572 U.S. 663 , 670, 134
S.Ct. 1962 , 188 L.Ed.2d 979 (2014) . Under the separate-accrual rule, ""when a defendant commits successive violations,
the statute of limitations runs separately from each violation."" /d. at 671, 134 S.Ct. 1962 . Therefore, ""[eJach act of [copyright]
infringement is a distinct harm giving rise to an independent claim for relief."" Id. (quoting_Stone v. Williams. 970 F.2d 1043 ,
1049 (2d Cir. 1992)). However, ""[t]his does not mean that when infringements occur during the limitations period recovery
may be had for past infringements."" Stone, 970 F.2d at 1049-50 (""Application of the continuous wrong doctrine generally has
been rejected in the infringement context."" (collecting cases)). ""[A]n infringement is actionable within three years, and only
hree years, of its occurrence,"" and ""the infringer is insulated from liability for earlier infringements of the same work.""
Petrella, 572 U.S. at 671 , 134 S.Ct. 1962 .

Plaintiffs filed this action on October 23, 2018. (Compl.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot bring claims for any purported
infringement that occurred prior to October 23, 2015, which includes the creation of the 2013 Documentary and its display at
ilm festivals in February of 2013. (Am. Compl. § 176.) Although Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Moving Defendants’ infringing
activities are ""continuing to this date,"" ( id. {§ 166-171), and argue that they have provided proof of infringing acts that
occurred ""as late as 2019,"" (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 10), and although they are correct that, under the separate-
accrual rule, claims based on infringing acts that occurred within the statute of limitations are actionable, their claims against
he Joint Moving Defendants are all based on infringing acts that occurred prior to October 23, 2015, and there is no
evidence in the record to support their allegations of continuing infringement. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ copyright claims are time-
barred.

Even assuming that Plaintiffs' copyright claims against the Joint Moving Defendants were not time barred, for the reasons
explained below, the Court nevertheless grants summary judgment to the Joint Moving Defendants as to the copyright
claims.

2. Plaintiffs' direct infringement claims fail

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that the 2013 Documentary does not infringe Plaintiffs' copyrights because: (1) it is not
substantially similar to Plaintiffs' 2001 and 2003 Documentaries because the works ""have vastly different moods, themes,
characters and plots""; (2) with respect to the 2001 Documentary, the 2013 Documentary does not include actionable
amounts

[623 F.Supp.3d 88]

of actual copying under the alternative ""fragmented literal similarity"" test; and (3) even if the 2013 Documentary is similar to
the 2001 Documentary under the alternative test, Plaintiffs’ claim relating to the 2001 Documentary is barred by the fair use

doctrine. (Defs.' Joint Mem. 2 (footnote omitted). See generally id. at 16-31.)


--- Page 9 ---
Plaintiffs dispute the accuracy of the copies of the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries the Nathan Defendants provided to the
Court, arguing that the USB drive was ""tampered [with] or altered"" because those works had never been available in ""digital
format"" and that the works should not have been provided to the Nathan Defendants by Plaintiffs' former counsel, who had
an ethical obligation to return client files. (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 6-7.) Plaintiffs do not address the Joint Moving
Defendants' arguments regarding the lack of similarities between the substance of the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries
compared to the 2013 Documentary. ( /d. at 7.)

""To establish a claim of copyright infringement, 'two elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2)

satisfy the second element, [a claimant] 'must demonstrate that: (1) the [alleged infringer] has actually copied the

A. The 2001 Documentary

Based on its review of the documentary evidence submitted, the Court finds that none of the points of substantial similarity
that Plaintiffs assert have merit and that

[623 F.Supp.3d 90]

the works as a whole are not substantially similar under the standard test for substantial similarity. In addition, although the


--- Page 10 ---
works may be substantially similar under the fragmented literal similarity test, Defendants' use of excerpts from the 2001
Documentary is fair use.

(1) Standard test

Plaintiffs contend that the 2013 Documentary and the 2001 Documentary share a similar setting, characters, mood and
theme, and plot. (Am. Compl. 27-33.)

It is a ""fundamental axiom of copyright law ... that 'no author may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates."" Arica Inst.

1. Setting in Baltimore

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that the setting of the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries in Baltimore is not protectable,
both because it is a"" scéne a faire"" and because it is an ""unprotected fact[] of Pug's life."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 19-20.)

Plaintiffs allege that the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries were filmed at ""Reisterstown Road, Druid Hill Park, and Interstate
83"" in Baltimore, and that the 2013 Documentary was filmed at the same locations,

[623 F.Supp.3d 91]
copying the setting of their films. (Am. Compl. 27.)

Although the 2013 Documentary was filmed in the same locations in Baltimore where the 2001 Documentary was filmed,
this similarity flows from the similar themes of the works, which are both about the 12 O'Clock Boyz who are from Baltimore
and ride in those locations, and from the premise of the 2013 Documentary's plot, which follows a local boy's dream to
become part of this group. See Hoehling, 618 F.2d at 979 (holding that ""settings which are as a practical matter
indispensable, or at least standard, in the treatment of a given topic"" are non-copyrightable scénes a faire (quoting
Alexander v. Haley. 460 F. Supp. 40 , 45 (S.D.N.Y. 1978))); Cavalier v. Random House, Inc., 297 F.3d 815 , 824 (9th Cir.
2002) (finding that although works shared setting in night sky, ""this setting naturally and necessarily flows from the basic plot
premise of a child's journey through the night sky; therefore, the night sky setting constitutes scenes-a-faire and cannot
support a finding of substantial similarity""); Lewinson v. Henry Holt & Co.,659 F. Supp. 2d 547 , 574 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (""While
both works depict scenes in the United States, Australia, Mexico, Russia, Japan, and China, it is to be expected that two
works about children from around the world will share some overlap in the countries they depict. ... These similarities are
therefore unprotectable scénes a faire that naturally flow from the similar themes of the works."") (first citing Cavalier,_297
F.3d at 824 ; and then citing Williams, 84 F.3d at 589 ); see also Montgomery, 833 F. App'x at 364 (""[T]he settings of cafés,
bridges crossing the Seine, apartments, and parties are all scenes a faire arising from the works' respective depictions of
Americans living in Paris, and therefore are not protectable.""); Alexander v. Murdoch, No. 10-CV-5613, 2011 WL 2802923,

App'x 107 (2d Cir. 2012).

The setting of the 2013 Documentary in these locations in Baltimore is also not protectable because it is a fact in the public
domain that the 12 O'Clock Boyz are from Baltimore and ride in these specific locations. (See Tim Hill, High Noon: Taking It
to the Streets with the 12 O'Clock Boyz, Balt. City Paper, May 21, 2003, annexed to Am. Compl. as Ex. 14, Docket Entry No.
99, at 37-39 [hereinafter Hill] (reporting groups of 12 O'Clock Boyz riding on Reisterstown Road and at Druid Hill Park));

Walker, 784 F.2d at 50 (finding that ""the notion of telling a police story"" about a group of police from the 41st Precinct in the
South Bronx ""that takes place there cannot be copyrightable"" because ""the South Bronx and the 41st Precinct are real
places known to the public through media reportage""); see also Feist Pub‘ns, Inc., 499 U.S. at 347 , 111 S.Ct. 1282
(explaining that no one may claim originality as to facts ""because facts do not owe their origin to an act of authorship""). For
the same reason, the presence of dirt-bike riders in the neighborhoods where they ride in real life is not copyrightable, nor is
a scene of them riding in a group, as they do regularly, as depicted in Plaintiffs’ films and reported in the Baltimore City
Paper. See Hill, supra , at 37-39; Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings. Inc., 931 F. Supp. 2d 537 , 549 (S.D.N.Y.
2013) (""The reporting of facts is not protectable under the Copyright Act since facts are 'never original to an author.”
(quoting Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc.,166 F.3d at 70 )).

2. Characters
The Joint Moving Defendants argue that (1) Plaintiffs concede that the characters
[623 F.Supp.3d 92]

are different because Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Moving Defendants ""cast[ed]"" dirt-bike riders from different dirt-bike
groups to play 12 O'Clock Boys; (2) dirt-bike stunt riders are stock characters in works involving dirt-bike riding and the
stunts they perform are unprotected scénes a faire ; (3) the character named ""Pug"" who briefly appears in the 2001
Documentary is a completely different person from the Pug who is the protagonist of the 2013 Documentary, the
""coincidence of their shared name does not establish substantial similarity,"" and Plaintiffs' Pug is ""a stock character with
totally fungible characteristics of a dirt bike rider""; and (4) the 2013 Documentary's focus on Pug, Coco, and Tibba, who do
not appear in the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries, ""highlights the character differences in the works and their dissimilar plots,
themes and moods."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 20-21.)

Plaintiffs allege that they ""casted a specific group of highly-skilled dirt-bike riders who Plaintiff Taje called the 12 O'Clock
Boyz"" and the 2013 Documentary ""casted Wildout Wheelie Boyz, Raise It Up, and random dirt-bike riders"" to play the 12
O'Clock Boys, copying Plaintiffs’ characters. (Am. Compl. 27.) In addition, Plaintiffs allege that ""Pug is the name of one of
the riders who appears"" in the 2001 Documentary ""wearing his hat turned backwards,"" and the 2013 Documentary copied
the character Pug, featuring him in a press note and on a DVD cover with his hat turned backwards. ( /d. at 28.)

As the Joint Moving Defendants argue, the dirt-bike riders in the 2001 Documentary, including Pug, are ""stock characters""
and thus are not protectable elements of Plaintiffs' work. The concept of skilled riders who perform daring stunts is not
novel, and this basic character type flows from the theme of a work about dirt-bike riding. In addition, the characters are not
developed beyond these attributes. See Williams, 84 F.3d at 589 (""[T]he less developed the characters, the less they can be
copyrighted; that is the penalty an author must bear for marking them too indistinctly."" (quoting_Nichols v. Universal Pictures
Corp., 45 F.3d 119 , 121 (2d Cir. 1930))). This is particularly significant with respect to Pug. The Pug of the 2013
Documentary shares no similarities with the Pug who appears in the 2001 Documentary other than having the same name
and wearing a backwards baseball cap. However, the fact that these characters share the same name does not by itself
make them substantially similar. See 37 C.F.R. § 202.1(a) (stating that ""[w]ords and short phrases such as names, titles, and
slogans"" are ""not subject to copyright""); Eng v. Captain Blue Hen Comics, No. 14-CV-3631, 2014 WL 2941280, at *3
(E.D.N.Y. June 30, 2014) (""[The] plaintiff cannot claim ownership of statutory copyright for the name Terrordactyl."" (citations
omitted)); Sinicola v. Warner Bros., 948 F. Supp. 1176 , 1187 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (""A review of the remaining characters in the
two works reveals no significant similarity of protectable expression, notwithstanding a number of identical or similar
character names.""); see also Hogan, 48 F. Supp. 2d at 311 (""The most obvious similarity between the main characters in
Matchsticks and Dhampire is that they share the same name: Nicholas Gaunt. This shared trait, by itself, is insufficient to
establish substantial similarity between the characters.""). In addition, the fact that the characters both at times appear
wearing a backwards hat is a ""generic and generalized character trait[]"" that is not protectable. Abdin, 971 F.3d at 67 (noting
that traits ""such as race, gender, and hair color are not protectable""). More significantly, in the 2001 Documentary, ""Pug"" is
shown as an adult member of the 12 O'Clock Boyz, but the audience does not hear about how

[623 F.Supp.3d 93]

he joined, and his character is not explored or developed. By contrast, Pug is the main character and protagonist of the
2013 Documentary, who faces conflict between the desire to join a group of dirt-bike riders and his aspiration to become a
veterinarian, and the viewer sees Pug grow up over the course of several years, as his ambition remains constant and his
riding skills develop. See id. at 70 (""Most significantly, while it is unclear what role the nameless tardigrade plays in the
vjideogame, Ripper is very much at the center of a fully-developed story in ... the first season of Discovery. ""); see also
Williams, 84 F.3d at 589 (""[T]he less developed the characters, the less they can be copyrighted; that is the penalty an

author must bear for marking them too indistinctly."" (quoting Nichols, 45 F.3d at 121 )). The Pug portrayed in the 2001
Documentary and the Pug portrayed in the 2013 Documentary are therefore characters with a different ""total concept and
eel."" 12 See Walker,_784 F.2d at 50 (noting that, to determine whether a film misappropriates characters, courts ""must
consider the ‘totality of [their] attributes and traits' as well as the extent to which the defendants’ characters capture the ‘total
concept and feel of figures"" in the plaintiff's work (quoting Warner Bros. Inc.,720 F.2d at 241 )); Silberstein v. John Does 1-
10, 242 F. App'x 720, 722 (2d Cir. 2007) (describing the different portrayals of two similarly named cartoon animals and
inding no infringement because the ""total concept and feel"" of the characters differed (quoting Boisson v. Banian, Ltd., 273



--- Page 12 ---
F.3d 262 , 272 (2d Cir. 2001))).
3. Mood and theme

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that (1) the 2013 Documentary is not ""docu-fiction"" as Plaintiffs define it because it does
not include fictional elements, and even if it were, this film style is not protectable because Plaintiffs do not have an exclusive
right to make a ""docu-fiction"" about dirt-bike riding; (2) although both works begin with news clips, Plaintiffs do not have the
exclusive right to make a documentary about dirt biking in Baltimore that begins with a news clip, ""[f]acts and events are not
protected by copyright,"" and the clips are ""very different in tone and purpose""; (3) Plaintiffs’ use of techniques such as filming
in slow-motion and from a moving truck are not novel and ""a film's technique is not a protectable element under copyright
law""; (4) the fact that both works include interviews with people on the front steps of a house is ""non-actionable"" and
Plaintiffs do not allege ""that the interviewers, interviewees or interview subjects are the same""; (5) transitions between riding
scenes and interviews on the street and at people's homes are scénes a faire and the interviews ""are expressed differently,
including their topics and their purpose""; (6) although both works pay respect to someone who passed away, ""there is no
literal or conceptual similarity"" in how they do so and ""countless... works pay respect to real and/or fictional characters that
passed""; and (7) the use of a clip showing the 12 O'Clock Boyz riding down the street labeled ""The 12 O'Clock Boys"" is a
""de minimis"" use that does not constitute infringement. (Defs.' Joint Mem. 21-24.)

[623 F.Supp.3d 94]

Plaintiff alleges that the 2013 Documentary copies the mood and theme of the 2001 Documentary because (1) the 2013
Documentary ""intentionally mimics"" Plaintiffs’ ""artistic expression"" by ""mixing real events with fictional scenes to support [its]
narrative,"" placing it in the ""docu-fiction"" genre, and filming in an ""[a]mateur [d]ocu-fiction style""; (2) both works begin with a
media clip used ""[t]o give [the] feel of a documentary""; (3) the 2013 Documentary copies the 2001 Documentary's
techniques of filming stunts in slow-motion and from a moving vehicle; (4) both works include interviews with people in front
of their homes; (5) both works include transitions from riding scenes to interview scenes; (6) the 2001 Documentary pays
respect to a rider named ""Buck"" who passed away during filming and the 2013 Documentary pays respect to Pug's brother
Tibba who passed away during filming; and (7) the 2013 Documentary took a clip from the 2001 Documentary showing the
12 O'Clock Boyz riding down the street and labeled the riders ""The 12 O'Clock Boys."" (Am. Compl. 29-33.)

The aspects of the 2013 and 2001 Documentaries' mood and theme that Plaintiffs highlight are not substantially similar.
Although Plaintiffs describe the ""mood and theme"" of their 2001 Documentary as ""docu-fiction"" 18 and allege that the 2013
Documentary ""mimics [their] artistic expression"" in that it is also docu-fiction, Plaintiffs do not have the exclusive right to
make docu-fiction about dirt-bike riders, as methods of story-telling are not protectable. See 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) (excluding
from copyright protection ""any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery,
regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work""); 37 C.F.R. § 202.1
(including as an example of works not subject to copyright ""[iJdeas, plans, methods, systems, or devices, as distinguished
from the particular manner in which they are expressed or described""); cf. Rose, 2018 WL 626350, at “5 (""Neither a style of
playing [the guitar] nor the skill with which a composition is played are protectable, only the composition itself may be
protected if it is sufficiently original.""); Churchill Livingstone, Inc. v. Williams & Wilkins, 949 F. Supp. 1045 , 1051-52
(S.D.N.Y. 1996) (""[T]he choice of a type of illustration is not copyrightable. Thus, the decision to illustrate heart formation
with a 3-D drawing is not copyrightable."").

In addition, the use of a news clip or voiceover at the beginning of a film to give it a ""documentary feel"" is not original to
Plaintiffs’ work but rather a common feature of documentaries. Similarly, Plaintiffs’ use of techniques such as filming stunts in
slow-motion and from a moving vehicle is not original to Plaintiffs' work, as these are common procedures for filming action
sequences. See Fulks v. Knowles-Carter, 207 F. Supp. 3d 274, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (""To the extent that the shots are filmed
in a ‘fast sweeping motion,' this is a common feature among cinema not original to [the plaintiff's work].""); see also Stouffer v.

623 F.Supp.3d 95]

Nat'l Geographic Partners, LLC, 400 F. Supp. 3d 1161, 1189 (D. Colo. 2019) (finding that voice-over narration, narration
beginning immediately after introductory credits, and ""slow-motion action shot[s],"" among other things, are ""so standard as
0 essentially define the nature documentary genre"" and are ""unprotectable ‘ideas[s]' or 'procedure[s]"" (alterations in
original) (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 102(b))); Gal v. Viacom Int'l, Inc..518 F. Supp. 2d 526 , 546 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (""[MJaterial or
hemes commonly repeated in a certain genre are not protectable by copyright ...."" (quoting Am. Direct Mktg. v. Azad Int'l
Inc., 783 F. Supp. 84 , 95 (E.D.N.Y. 1992))). In addition, although both works open with a media excerpt, this similarity is
insubstantial, as the works use different types of clips and incorporate them in different ways, setting different tones for the
ilms. While the 2001 Documentary includes a short news segment in which a news anchor, using an approving tone of
voice, states that the wheelie is ""the stunt every four-wheeler rider wants to master,"" (2001 Documentary 00:47-00:51), the
2013 Documentary opens with a long audio clip in which a man — likely a radio host or caller — expresses his disapproval
of ""these little scumbags on these dirt bikes in our downtown,"" (2013 Documentary 00:15-00:54). The media clip in the
opening of the 2001 Documentary portrays the riders in a neutral to positive fashion, with a tone of appreciation for the
challenging stunts they perform, while the voiceover used in the 2013 Documentary takes a distinctly negative tone,
unambiguously incorporating the speaker's personal views into the discussion. See Walker,_784 F.2d at 50-51 (finding
similarity ""that in both works a person is thrown off a roof"" to be ""insubstantial"" because ""the differences between the two
incidents are overwhelming""); Warner Bros. Inc.,720 F.2d at 243 (""Superman performs his superhuman feats with skill,
verve, and dash, clearly the master of his own destiny. Hinkley is perplexed by the superhuman powers his costume confers



--- Page 13 ---
and uses them in a bumbling, comical fashion."").

Further, the 2013 Documentary's interviews with Pug, Coco, and others in the neighborhood in which they live, as well as its
transitions between dirt-bike riding and interviews in the neighborhood, are scénes a faire that follow naturally from the
documentary format and theme of the work. See Walker,_784 F.2d at 50 (""Foot chases and the morale problems of
policemen, not to mention the familiar figure of the Irish cop, are venerable and often-recurring themes of police fiction."");
Williams, 84 F.3d at 589 (""While both the Dinosaur World books and the Jurassic Park works share a setting of a dinosaur
zoo or adventure park, with electrified fences, automated tours, dinosaur nurseries, and uniformed workers, these settings
are classic scenes a faire that flow from the uncopyrightable concept of a dinosaur zoo.""). In addition, while both works
incorporate interviews, they are conducted in different settings, and the 2013 Documentary covers a broader range of
topics. In the 2001 Documentary, most interviews are done in a bare, intimate setting on a brown couch and some
interviews in both works are conducted near a group of riders. In the 2013 Documentary, interviews occur throughout Pug's
house or on the street outside and the interviewer asks about broader social questions in addition to asking about the
mechanics of dirt-bike stunts.

In addition, although the 2013 Documentary uses a clip from the 2001 Documentary in which the 12 O'Clock Boyz are
depicted riding down the street, this brief, single clip does not appear to be qualitatively or quantitatively significant to the

2001 Documentary, and is therefore a de
[623 F.Supp.3d 96]

minimis similarity that does not, on its own, give rise to a finding of substantial similarity between the works. See Warner
Bros., Inc., 720 F.2d at 242 (explaining that, under the "" de minimis rule,"" the ""literal copying of a small and usually
insignificant portion of the plaintiffs work"" may be permissible); Nobile v. Watts, 747 F. App'x at 882 (""[T]he brief exchange
in each work in which a stranger compares the baby's nose to one parent's nose ... reflects a de minimis similarity that does
not, on its own, give rise to a finding of substantial similarity between the works."").

In addition, although both works pay respect to someone who passed away during filming, this common theme is too
general to be protectable, and, as the Joint Moving Defendants argue, there are no similarities in the works' treatment of this
theme — the 2001 Documentary acknowledges Buck's passing in a simple overlay at the end of the film, while the 2013
Documentary incorporates Tibba's death as part of its plot and explores its impact on Pug. See, e.g., Castro v. Cusack, No.
15-CV-6714, 2019 WL 3385218, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. July 16, 2019) (finding that the fact that the ""universal theme[]"" of ""loss""
appeared in both works ""speaks to their general nature and does not, without more, give rise to an inference of copyright
infringement""); see also Funky Films, Inc. v. Time Warner Ent. Co.. 462 F.3d 1072 , 1079 (9th Cir. 2006) (""Although both
works explore themes of death, relationships, and sex, they do so in very different ways.""), overruled on other grounds by
Skidmore v. Led Zeppelin, 952 F.3d 1051 (9th Cir. 2020) ; DuMond v. Reilly, No. 19-CV-8922, 2021 WL 733311, at *15 (C.D.
Cal. Jan. 14, 2021) (noting that books covered similar topics, including death, ""in different ways,"" and ""these general topics
are clearly not protectable by copyright"").

4. Plot similarities

Defendants argue that ""Plaintiffs' short plot summary is contradicted by the works themselves,"" and ""the alleged similarity is,
at most, of a general plot idea and, as such, is not protected under the Copyright Act."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 24.)

Plaintiffs allege that the 2013 Documentary's plot, in which ""Pug, a young boy, wants to join the 12 O'Clock Boys,"" is similar
to the 2001 Documentary's plot, in which ""elite young riders (including 'Pug') showcase their talents and discuss what it
takes for other young men to join the 12 O'Clock Boyz."" (Am. Compl. 33.)

Although, at the most general level, the 2013 and 2001 Documentaries both tell a story about the 12 O'Clock Boyz, the
""differences in plot ... far outweigh this general likeness."" Walker,_784 F.2d at 49 . The 2001 Documentary is a series of clips
of 12 O'Clock Boyz riders displaying their riding prowess, while the 2013 Documentary is a narrative work with a more
somber tone, developed characters, and a complex storyline, which focuses on the challenges faced by one young man who
aspires to be a rider. /d. (finding plot and dramatic structure of works dissimilar even though ""[b]oth recount the experiences
of policemen battling the hostile environment of the 41st Precinct"" because the defendant's work is ""intensely plotted"" with
""several vivid, interrelated story lines,"" while the plaintiff's work ""is organized topically, moves anecdotally from one event to
another, and has little plot or story line,"" and ""achieves its effects by creating a depressing, somewhat impressionistic,
cumulative portrait of life in a crime-ridden and poverty-stricken urban neighborhood""). In addition, to the extent the 2001
Documentary's plot can be understood as one of inspiring young riders to join the 12 O'Clock Boyz, this is a general plot idea
that is not protectable

[623 F.Supp.3d 97

beyond the manner in which it is expressed in the film. See Nichols, 45 F.2d at 122 (stating that plaintiffs have no ""monopoly""
over a general plot idea).

5. Total concept and feel

In addition to the fact that the elements of the documentaries singled out by Plaintiffs do not constitute substantial


--- Page 14 ---
similarities, the total concept and feel of the 2013 Documentary is not substantially similar to the 2001 Documentary when
the works are viewed as a whole. As discussed above, Plaintiffs’ work is an approximately half-hour-long series of loosely
connected clips of 12 O'Clock Boyz riders displaying their riding prowess. The 2013 Documentary, which is nearly twice as
long, is a narrative work with a different tone, characters who are developed and whose relationships are explored, and a
clearer and more complex plot that follows Pug across several years as he faces challenges and pursues his goal to
become a rider. Thus, the ""total concept and feel"" of the works are different, Peter F. Gaito Architecture LLC, 602 F.3d at 67
(quoting Hamil Am. Inc. v. GFI, 193 F.3d 92 , 102 (2d Cir. 1999)), and the ""average lay observer"" would not ""recognize the
alleged copy as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work,"" id. (citing Knitwaves, Inc., 71 F.3d at 1001 ) (holding
that the plaintiffs design for an architectural project was not infringed by another firm's re-design of the project, which
contained some similar elements); see also Webb v. Stallone, 555 F. App'x 31, 33 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that a movie was
not substantially similar to a screenplay, although they shared some common elements, because one was a ""gunfire-riddled
‘pure action’ flick,"" while the other was ""a trickery-based true caper"": ""a tale of a cunning heist with sensitive and human
characters,"" so their ""total concept and feel"" were ""quite distinct"").

Accordingly, the 2013 Documentary is not substantially similar to the 2001 Documentary under the standard test for
substantial similarity.

(2) Fragmented literal similarity test and fair use

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that the 2013 Documentary is not substantially similar to the 2001 Documentary under
the alternative fragmented literal similarity test and that, even if it is, their use of clips from the 2001 Documentary is fair use.
(Defs.' Joint Mem. 25-31.)

Plaintiffs have not responded to the Joint Moving Defendants’ arguments that the works are not substantially similar under
the fragmented literal similarity test but argue that the Joint Moving Defendants' use of clips from the 2001 Documentary is
not fair use. (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 14-17.)

1. Fragmented literal similarity test

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that the works are not substantially similar under the fragmented literal similarity test
because (1) the use of eighty-seven seconds of Plaintiffs' 2001 Documentary, edited into seventy-five seconds that appear
in the 2013 Documentary, amounts to 3.7% of the 2001 Documentary and is not quantitatively significant, and (2) the
ragments of work used are not qualitatively significant when viewed in the context of the 2001 Documentary because none
of them are ""an inherently or especially important component"" of the 2001 Documentary. (Defs.' Joint Mem. 25-26.)

Based on the evidence, Plaintiffs may be able to demonstrate substantial similarity with respect to the 2001 Documentary
under a fragmented literal similarity theory. Plaintiffs argue that the clips taken from the 2001 Documentary are
impermissible copying. While the quantity of the borrowed material is small, its qualitative importance

623 F.Supp.3d 98]

o Plaintiffs’ work is a triable issue of fact. Because the 2001 Documentary consists of a series of vignettes, with a focus on
he skill shown by 12 O'Clock Boyz members, it is difficult to determine to what extent any particular exhibition of that skill is
qualitatively important to the work as a whole. The Joint Moving Defendants used clips of several seconds that amount to
under four percent of the 2001 Documentary, but the clips used constitute a selection of stunts and two short interview
segments, and the 2001 Documentary is a series of stunts and interview segments. In effect, the Joint Moving Defendants
captured over a minute of highlights of the 2001 Documentary. However, as explained below, the Joint Moving Defendants’
use of these clips is fair use.

2. Fair use

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that the 2013 Documentary's use of short clips from the 2001 Documentary constitutes
fair use because those clips ""were included to enable viewers ... to understand the impact of the legends appearing in the
2001 [Documentary] on Pug's desire to mimic their feats, join the 12 O'Clock Boyz and to recapture Pug's treasured memory
of watching it with his brother, Tibba."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 26-28.) The Joint Moving Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs’
attempt to limit the fair use defense to authors is unsupported by the Copyright Act and by precedent. (Defs.' Joint Reply 5-
6.)

Plaintiffs argue that Red Gap is not the true author of the 2013 Documentary, and until the author is determined, it cannot
raise fair use as a defense. (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 14-15.) As to the merits of the defense, Plaintiffs argue that fair
use does not apply because the Joint Moving Defendants' use is not transformative, their use was commercial in nature and
affected Plaintiffs' market for their works, the 2001 Documentary was creative in nature and therefore the doctrine should be

read narrowly, and the portion used was substantial both in kind and in quality. ( /d. at 16-17.)

internet video and viewing the two works side-by-side). Authorship is irrelevant to this test. See 17 U.S.C. § 107 (listing the
factors relevant to a fair-use determination, authorship not among them, and singling out the making of ""multiple copies for
classroom use"" as a potential fair use); Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google Inc., 954 F. Supp. 2d 282 , 293 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)
(holding that digital scanning of books, rendering them searchable and displaying ""snippets"" to the general searching public,
was permissible fair use), aff'd sub nom. Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202 (2d Cir. 2015) .

The Court evaluates below the statutory fair use factors to determine whether the Joint Moving Defendants’ use of the 2001
Documentary was fair.

a. Purpose and character of the use

In examining the purpose and character of an alleged fair use, courts examine whether the use is transformative and
whether it is commercial.

i. The use is transformative

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that their use of the work is transformative because excerpts of the 2001 Documentary
are played ""to understand the impact of the legends appearing in the 2001 [Documentary] on Pug's desire to mimic their
feats, join the 12 O'Clock Boyz and to recapture Pug's treasured memory of watching it with his brother, Tibba."" (Defs.' Joint
Mem. 28.)

Plaintiffs argue that, in evaluating whether the Joint Moving Defendants’ use is transformative, the Court must ask whether
""the material taken from the original work [has] been transformed by adding new expression or meaning"" and whether ""value
[was] added to the original by creating new information, new aesthetics, new insights, and [new] understandings."" (Pls.'
Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 16.) Plaintiffs argue that the first factor favors them because the Joint Moving Defendants’ film ""did
not add new information, new aesthetics, new insights, or understanding of the 12 O'Clock Boyz, nor did it add new
expression or meaning."" ( /d. at 17.)

In examining the first factor, ""the primary inquiry is whether the use ‘communicates something new and different from the
original or [otherwise] expands its utility,’ that is, whether the use is 'transformative.'"" Fox News Network, LLC v. Tveyes.
Inc., 883 F.3d 169 , 176 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Google, Inc., 804 F.3d at 214 ). ""To be transformative, a use must ‘do[]
something more than repackage or republish the original copyrighted work’; it must 'add something new, with a further

[623 F.Supp.3d 100]

purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning or message."" /d. (alteration in original)
(quoting Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust, 755 F.3d 87 , 96 (2d Cir. 2014)); see also Goldsmith, 11 F.4th at 37 (stating that
transformative means that the use ""adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with
new expression, meaning, or message,"" rather than merely ""supersed[ing] the objects of the original creation"" (quoting
Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 )); Capitol Recs., LLC, 910 F.3d at 660 (same). Although ""[u]ses that criticize,
comment on, provide information about, or provide new uses for the copyrighted work are those likely to be deemed
transformative,"" Capitol Recs., LLC, 910 F.3d at 660-61 , the Second Circuit has noted that an infringing work does not need



--- Page 16 ---
to comment on the original work in order to satisfy this first factor, see Yang v. Mic Network Inc., No. 20-4097, 2022 WL
906513, at *2 (2d Cir. Mar. 29, 2022) (""[T]he law imposes no requirement that a work comment on the original... in order to
be considered transformative."" (quoting Cariou,_714 F.3d at 706 )); Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d
605 , 611 (2d Cir. 2006) (stating that a defendant is ""not required to discuss the artistic merits"" of the original image to
satisfy the first factor); see also Cariou, 714 F.3d at 706 (""The law imposes no requirement that a work comment on the
original or its author in order to be considered transformative, and a secondary work may constitute a fair use even if it
serves some purpose other than those ... identified in the preamble to the statute.""). Some courts within the Second Circuit
have found that ""[djocumentaries and biographies fall within the protected categories of § 107, and are entitled to the
presumption [that] the use of the copyrighted material is fair."" Hofheinz v. Discovery Commc'ns, Inc., No. 00-CV-3802, 2001
WL 1111970, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2001); Monster Comme'ns, Inc. v. Turner Broad. Sys., 935 F. Supp. 490 , 493-94
(S.D.N.Y. 1996) (finding that a documentary about Muhammad Ali was a biography and therefore ""undeniably constitute[d] a
combination of comment, criticism, scholarship and research, all of which enjoy favored status under § 107"" (quoting Arica
Inst.. Inc. v. Palmer, 761 F. Supp. 1056 , 1067 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), aff'd, 970 F.2d 1067 (2d Cir. 1992) )).

The Joint Moving Defendants’ use of Plaintiffs' work is transformative because the work plays a new role in the narrative of
the 2013 Documentary. The 2013 Documentary includes clips from the 2001 Documentary placed in a new context as a
locally popular tape that had inspired Pug to start dirt-bike riding and uses it to explain the personal significance to Pug
because he had watched it, along with the 2003 Documentary, many times with Tibba. See Hofheinz v. A & E Television
Networks, 146 F. Supp. 2d 442 , 446 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (holding that twenty seconds of footage from an actor's early film
career in a biography was fair use because ""the use made of this particular footage... to show the kind of motion picture
roles [the actor] took when he first began his acting career and what his perception of them was, served to enrich the
biography"" and thus was transformative); see also Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 609 (""[C]Jourts have frequently afforded
fair use protection to the use of copyrighted material in biographies, recognizing such works as forms of historic scholarship,
criticism, and comment that require incorporation of original source material for optimum treatment of their subjects.""); Solid
Oak Sketches, LLC v. 2K Games, Inc., 449 F. Supp. 3d 333, 347 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (holding that reproduction of basketball

[623 F.Supp.3d 101]

players’ tattoos in a video game featuring the players was a transformative use, because, in part, ""[t]he [t]attoos were
originally created as a means for the [p]layers to express themselves through body art"" and were reproduced in the game so
that the characters depicted in the video game would be identifiable as specific real-life players). The transformative nature
of the Joint Moving Defendants’ use in the 2013 Documentary provides significant support for a finding of fair use.

ii. The use is commercial

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that ""Plaintiffs' labeling the [2013] Documentary 'commercial in nature’ ignore[s] the
insignificance of this designation as a fair use factor,"" and that courts in this Circuit have found that documentaries and
biographies enjoy a ""special fair use status."" (Defs.' Joint Reply 6 n.5.)

Plaintiffs argue that the 2013 Documentary ""is of a commercial nature,"" weighing against a finding of fair use. (Pls.' Opp'n to
Defs.' Joint Mot. 16.)

The first statutory factor also requires courts to consider ""whether copyrighted materials are used for a commercial purpose
or for a nonprofit educational purpose, the former tending 'to weigh against a finding of fair use."""" TCA Television Corp., 839
F.3d at 183 (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 585 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ); Brown v. Netflix, Inc., 462 F. Supp. 3d 453, 461 (S.D.N.Y.
2020) (same), aff'd, 855 F. App'x 61 (2d Cir. 2021). ""[WJhile the mere fact of a commercial motivation rarely pushes the first
factor determination against fair use ... in some circumstances a commercial motive will weigh against a finding of fair use
under Factor One."" Capitol Recs., LLC, 910 F.3d at 661 . ""The less a use provides transformative value, the more its
commercialism will weigh against a finding of fair use."" /d. (citing Campbell_510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ); see Fox
News Network, LLC,_883 F.3d at 178 (""[T]he [less] transformative the new work, the [more] will be the significance of other
factors..."" (second and third alterations in original) (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 )); Cariou, 714 F.3d
at 708 (same).

The 2013 Documentary is offered for commercial sale, and therefore has a commercial purpose. See Arrow Prods., LTD. v.
Weinstein Co., 44 F. Supp. 3d 359, 370 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (stating that the use of an allegedly infringing work has a
commercial purpose ""when a secondary user makes unauthorized use of copyrighted material to gain a profit through
copying the original work""). However, as the Joint Moving Defendants argue, commercial uses are not presumptively unfair.
See Cariou, 714 F.3d at 708 (""[A]s the Supreme Court has recognized, Congress 'could not have intended’ a rule that
commercial uses are presumptively unfair."" (citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at 584 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 )). In addition, Plaintiffs do
not allege that the excerpts from the 2001 Documentary are used to advertise the 2013 Documentary, or that they are
otherwise used to enhance the commercial value of the 2013 Documentary. See Solid Oak Sketches, LLC, 449 F. Supp. 3d
at 348 (noting in a fair use analysis that while the video game challenged by plaintiffs was commercial, the tattoos depicted
in that game ""are indistinguishable during gameplay and they do not feature in any of the game's marketing materials""). The
commercial purpose of this use therefore weighs only slightly against a finding of fair use.

Considering the transformative nature of the use of Plaintiffs’ work in the 2013 Documentary together with the commercial


--- Page 17 ---
purpose of the 2013 Documentary, the
[623 F.Supp.3d 102]

first factor favors a finding of fair use. See Cariou, 714 F.3d at 708 (""[T]he more transformative the new work, the less will be

the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use."" (quoting Campbell, 510
U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 )).

b. Nature of the copyrighted work

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that this factor ""is rarely found to be determinative."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 29 n.37 (quoting
Davis v. Gap. Inc., 246 F.3d 152 , 175 (2d Cir. 2001)).) They also argue that Plaintiffs’ work is ""factual and informational,""
and therefore ""greater leeway is allowed in favor of finding fair use."" ( /d. )

Plaintiffs argue that because their work is creative in nature, not informational, this factor weighs against fair use. (Pls.' Opp'n
to Defs.' Joint Mot. 16.)

""The second factor directs courts to consider the nature of the copyrighted work ...."" Goldsmith, 11 F.4th at 45 ; Capitol
Recs., LLC, 910 F.3d at 661 (same) (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 107(2)). This factor ""calls for recognition that some works are
closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to
establish when the former works are copied."" Lombardo v. Dr. Seuss Enters., L.P., 729 F. App'x 131, 132-33 (2d Cir. 2018)
(quoting Campbell,_510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ); Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd.,_756 F.3d at 87 (same). The Supreme
Court has observed that ""[t]he law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or
fantasy."" Google, Inc., 804 F.3d at 220 (alteration in original) (quoting Harper & Row Publishers, Inc., 471 U.S. at 563 , 105
S.Ct. 2218 ). ""Courts have sometimes speculated that this might mean that a finding of fair use is more favored when the
copying is of factual works than when copying is from works of fiction."" /d. ; see Barcroft Media, Ltd. v. Coed Media Grp.,
LLC, 297 F. Supp. 3d 339, 353 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (""[C]opyrighted works that are creative or fictional are closer to the core of
copyright, and therefore less likely to be fairly used, than works that are factual in nature."" (citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586
, 114 S.Ct. 1164 )). However, ""[t]he mere fact that the original is a factual work ... should not imply that others may freely
copy it,"" as ""authors of factual works, like authors of fiction, should be entitled to copyright protection of their protected

expression."" Google, Inc., 804 F.3d at 220 .

At the second step of the fair use analysis, courts consider ""(1) whether [the work] is 'expressive or creative ... or more
factual, with a greater leeway being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work is factual or informational, and (2) whether
the work is published or unpublished, with the scope of fair use involving unpublished works being considerably narrower.”
Goldsmith, 11 F.4th at 45 (quoting Blanch, 467 F.3d at 256 ). This second factor ""has rarely played a significant role in the
determination of a fair use dispute."" Estate of Smith v. Graham, 799 F. App'x 36, 38 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoting Google, Inc., 804
F.3d at 220 ). ""[T]his factor 'may be of limited usefulness where the creative work is being used for a transformative purpose
..."""" Goldsmith, 11 F.4th at 45 (quoting Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 612 ); Capitol Recs., LLC, 910 F.3d at 661-62
(""Except to the extent that the nature of the copyrighted work is necessarily considered alongside the character and purpose
of the secondary use in deciding whether the secondary use has a transformative purpose, it rarely, by itself, furnishes any
substantial reasoning for favoring or disfavoring fair use."").

This factor has little relative importance. See Capitol Recs., LLC, 910 F.3d at 661-62 .
[623 F.Supp.3d 103]

The weight of this factor is even more limited in this case because the Joint Moving Defendants reproduced excerpts from
the 2001 Documentary to illustrate their effect on Pug, rather than because the stunts captured in the 2001 Documentary
add creative value to the 2013 Documentary. As the excerpts play, Pug recalls the effect that watching the tape of ""the
legends"" had on him. The Joint Moving Defendants’ original filmography captures many similar stunts, at greater length, in
higher-definition film. Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 612-13 (""[E]ven though [the plaintiff's] images are creative works,
which are a core concern of copyright protection, the second factor has limited weight in our analysis because the purpose
of [the defendant's] use was to emphasize the images' historical rather than creative value."").

Plaintiffs concede that the 2001 Documentary was previously published. Cariou,_714 F.3d at 709-10 . Although the Joint
Moving Defendants argue otherwise, the Court finds that the 2001 Documentary is expressive in nature, see id., and
therefore enjoys more protection than a strictly factual work. However, this factor has limited weight in light of the
transformative nature of the Joint Moving Defendants’ use. See id. at 710 (holding ""this factor 'may be of limited usefulness
where,' as here, ‘the creative work of art is being used for a transformative purpose"" (quoting Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d
at 612 )).

c. Amount and substantiality of use
The Joint Moving Defendants argue that ""the reconfigured aggregate of the fractional [e]xcerpts included in the [2013]

Documentary are approximately [eighty-seven] seconds of the [thirty-four-minute-and-forty-seven-second-long] 2001
[Documentary],"" which ""constitutes only [four percent] of the 2001 [Documentary] — not '[seventy percent] or more,' as


--- Page 18 ---
Plaintiffs allege."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 29.) In addition, the Joint Moving Defendants argue that ""with the exception of the
approximately [twelve] seconds in which the 12 O'Clock Boyz title appears ..., every other excerpt is limited to just [two to
four] seconds of longer segments ... of dirt bike stunts or interviews,"" which is ""the amount required to establish a visual of
the 'legends' from the tape and/or stunts they performed to provide context for why the 2001 [Documentary] had an impact
upon Pug and contributed to his desire to follow in their footsteps."" ( /d. at 29-30.) The Joint Moving Defendants also argue
that ""[s]uch limited use, ‘to conjure up at least enough of the original’ to accomplish the transformative purpose in the [2013]
Documentary, is a permissible fair use,"" ( id. at 30 (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 588 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 )), and ""once the
transformative purpose was achieved, no further use of any content from Plaintiffs’ [works] occurred over the remaining [fifty-
seven] minutes of the [2013] Documentary,"" ( id. at 30 n.39).

Plaintiff argues that this factor ""clearly cuts"" in their favor because the Joint Moving Defendants ""took upward of [thirty] clips
and the movie title card from Plaintiffs’ film[,] which is substantial,"" and the Joint Moving Defendants ""took the heart of
Plaintiffs['] film."" (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.’ Joint Mot. 16.)

""The third factor considers 'the amount and substantiality of the portion [of the original] used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole."" Goldsmith, 11 F.4th at 45 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 107(3)); Capitol Recs., LLC, 910 F.3d at 662 (same). In
assessing this factor, a court must consider the ""amount of copyrighted material made available to the public rather than the
amount of material used by the copier."" Fox News Network, LLC, 883 F.3d at 179 ; see Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at
613 (""We review this factor

[623 F.Supp.3d 104]

with reference to the copyrighted work, not the infringing work.""). In addition, a court must ""consider not only ‘the quantity of
the [copyrighted] materials used’ but also ‘their quality and importance’ in relation to the original work."" Goldsmith,_11_F.4th
at 45-46 (quoting TCA Television Corp.,_839 F.3d at 185 ). ""[A] finding of fair use is more likely when small amounts, or less
important passages, are copied than when the copying is extensive, or encompasses the most important parts of the
original."" Google, Inc., 804 F.3d at 221 . However, ""[clomplete unchanged copying has repeatedly been found justified as
fair use when the copying was reasonably appropriate to achieve the copier's transformative purpose and was done in such
a manner that it did not offer a competing substitute for the original."" /d. (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has held that
copying an entire copyrighted work neither cuts in favor of fair use nor against fair use. See Goldsmith, 11 F.4th at 46 (""[W]e
have rejected the proposition that this factor necessarily favors the copyright holder even where the secondary user has
copied the primary work in toto in service of a legitimate secondary purpose."" (first citing Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd., 756
F.3d at 89-90 ; and then citing Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301 , 310-11 (2d Cir. 1992))); see also Bill Graham Archives, 448
F.3d at 613 . Instead, courts should ""take into account that the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and
character of the use."" Cariou, 714 F.3d at 710 (citing Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 613 ). ""The ultimate question under
this factor is whether 'the quantity and value of the materials used are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.”
Goldsmith, 11 F.4th at 46 (quoting Campbell,_510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

As the Joint Moving Defendants argue, the portion of the work taken is quantitatively small. The excerpted portions are
representative portions of the original but do not provide a substitute for the 2001 Documentary. See Google, Inc.,_804 F.3d
at 221-22 . The ""purpose and character of the use"" is to provide a sample of the tape that Pug describes and which
motivated him to begin dirt-bike riding. Campbell,_51 U.S. at 586-87 . Therefore, this factor favors the Joint Moving
Defendants.

d. Effect of use on potential market for copyrighted work

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that the amount taken from the 2001 Documentary is not substantial because they used
short excerpts adding up to four percent of the work and that this limited use is ""to ‘conjure up' at least enough of the
original"" to make their creative point. (Defs.' Joint Mem. 29-30 (citing Campbell, 510 U.S. at 588 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).) The
Joint Moving Defendants also argue that the 2013 Documentary will not affect the market for the 2001 Documentary
because their use of excerpts from the 2001 Documentary is transformative, and the 2013 Documentary ""is not a market
substitute for ... a mostly chock-filled, random mix of daredevil stunts and boisterous commentary."" ( /d. at 30-31.)

Plaintiffs argue that the Joint Moving Defendants ""took the heart of Plaintiffs['] film,"" including more than thirty clips and the
title card, amounting to substantial use. (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 16.) In addition, Plaintiffs argue that the market for
the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries has been reduced by the perception that Plaintiffs consented to use of the excerpts in the
2013 Documentary. ( /d. )

""The final statutory factor considers the effect of the use upon the potentia
[623 F.Supp.3d 105]

market for or value of the copyrighted work ...."" Estate of Smith, 799 F. App'x at 39 (quoting TCA Television Corp., 839 F.3d
at 186 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 107(4))). This factor asks ""whether, if the challenged use becomes widespread, it will adversely
affect the potential market for the copyrighted work."" Goldsmith, 11 F.4th at 48 (quoting Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at
613 ). ""Analysis of this factor requires [courts] to balance the benefit the public will derive if the use is permitted and the


--- Page 19 ---
personal gain the copyright owner will receive if the use is denied."" /d. (quoting Wright v. Warner Books, Inc., 953 F.2d 731 ,
739 (2d Cir. 1991)). ""In assessing market harm, [courts] ask not whether the second work would damage the market for the
first ... but whether it usurps the market for the first by offering a competing substitute."" /d. (citing Bill Graham Archives, 448
F.3d at 614 ); see also Campbell, 510 U.S. at 592 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (stating that the role of a court is to ""distinguish between
'[b]iting criticism [that merely] suppresses demand [and] copyright infringement[, which] usurps it (alterations in original)
(quoting_Fisher v. Dees, 794 F.2d 432 , 438 (9th Cir. 1986))).

In weighing the fourth statutory fair use factor, a court must consider ""not only the extent of market harm caused by the
particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also 'whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by
the defendant ... would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market' for the original."" Campbell,_510 U.S.
at 590 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; Fox News Network, LLC, 883 F.3d at 179 . ""This analysis embraces both the primary market for the
work and any derivative markets that exist or that its author might reasonably license others to develop ...."" Goldsmith, 11.
F.4th at 48 ; TCA Television Corp., 839 F.3d at 186 ; see Am. Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913 , 929 (2d Cir.
1994) (""[T]he impact on potential licensing revenues is a proper subject for consideration in assessing the fourth factor.""). In
assessing harm posed to a licensing market, a court should focus on the ""challenged use's 'impact on potential licensing
revenues for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets"" and ""not on possible lost licensing fees from [the]
defendants’ challenged use."" TCA Television Corp., 839 F.3d at 186 (quoting Am. Geophysical Union, 60 F.3d at 929 n.17).
In effect, the fourth factor ""focuses on whether the copy brings to the marketplace a competing substitute for the original ...
so as to deprive the rights holder of significant revenues because of the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to
acquire the copy in preference to the original."" Fox News Network, LLC, 883 F.3d at 179 (quoting Google, Inc., 804 F.3d at
223 ). ""[T]he first and fourth factors are closely linked, as 'the more the copying is done to achieve a purpose that differs from
the purpose of the original, the less likely it is that the copy will serve as a satisfactory substitute for the original."" Goldsmith,
11 F.4th at 48 (quoting Google, Inc., 804 F.3d at 223 ).

Plaintiffs do not argue that they would be recouping additional licensing fees if not for the Joint Moving Defendants' use. Cf.
Castle Rock Ent., Inc., 150 F.3d at 145 (holding that the fourth factor favored the plaintiffs, who produced a television show,
because the defendants, who had produced a trivia book about that show, had entered a market that the plaintiffs might wish
to enter). Instead, Plaintiffs appear to argue that individuals who might have purchased one of their documentaries are less
likely to do so because the 2013 Documentary implies that Plaintiffs are associated with the Joint Moving Defendants.
However, the 2013 Documentary

[623 F.Supp.3d 106]

is not a market substitute for Plaintiffs' works because the Joint Moving Defendants have made a transformative use of a
small portion of the 2001 Documentary. See Monster Commc'ns, Inc.,935 F. Supp. at 495 (finding that ""the uses [of
historical footage] in [one film] are too few, too short, and too small in relation to the whole"" to undercut the market for the
other). Therefore, it is unlikely that potential purchasers of the 2001 Documentary would opt to acquire the 2013
Documentary in order to see the seventy-five seconds of clips from the 2001 Documentary in preference to the original. See
Google, Inc., 804 F.3d at 223 (explaining that this fair use factor examines ""whether the copy brings to the marketplace a
competing substitute for the original, or its derivative, so as to deprive the rights holder of significant revenues because of
the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original""); Brown, 462 F. Supp. 3d at
464 (""As the [f]ilm's use [of a clip from a song] is transformative of the original, the potential market ... would not ‘opt to
acquire the copy' of a limited eight seconds of the [s]ong 'in preference to the original.’ Put another way, it is unlikely that
[potential purchasers] would purchase copies of the film ... so that they could hear the excerpt of the [s]ong in the [f]ilm.""
(citation omitted) (quoting Google, Inc., 804 F.3d at 223 )). Therefore, this factor favors the Joint Moving Defendants. Cf.
Capitol Records, LLC,_910 F.3d at 662 (holding that the fourth factor favored the plaintiffs because the defendant made
digital reproductions of the plaintiffs’ audio files and online books ""for the purpose of resale in competition with the [p]laintiffs'
market,"" and explaining that ""the more the objective of the secondary use differs from that of the original, the less likely it will
supplant the commercial market for the original"").

In summary, the first factor strongly favors the Joint Moving Defendants because their use is transformative. The second,
which is of relatively little importance, favors Plaintiffs. The third and fourth factors favor the Joint Moving Defendants.
Accordingly, the Joint Moving Defendants’ use of clips from the 2001 Documentary constitutes fair use, and the Court grants
them summary judgment on Plaintiffs' copyright infringement claim with respect to this documentary.

B. The 2003 Documentary

Plaintiffs allege that the 2013 Documentary is substantially similar to the 2003 Documentary for many, but not all, of the
same reasons they allege it is similar to the 2001 Documentary — namely, because they share the same setting, the Joint
Moving Defendants casted other dirt-bike riders to play the 12 O'Clock Boys, both films are docu-fiction, and both films use
slow-motion. For the same reasons the 2013 Documentary is not substantially similar to the 2001 Documentary, it is also not
substantially similar to the 2003 Documentary with respect to these elements or in its total concept and feel. In addition,
because Plaintiffs do not allege that the 2013 Documentary contains actual clips from the 2003 Documentary, the
fragmented literal similarity test does not apply. Accordingly, the Court grants the Joint Moving Defendants summary
judgment on Plaintiffs’ copyright infringement claim with respect to the 2003 documentary.



--- Page 20 ---
3. Plaintiffs’ contributory and vicarious copyright infringement claims fail

Because Plaintiffs’ claims of direct copyright infringement fail as to both the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries, their claims of
contributory and vicarious copyright infringement also fail. See, e.g., Cariou, 714 F.3d at 712 (finding that because there was
no direct infringement, the defendants

[623 F.Supp.3d 107]

could not be held liable ""as a vicarious or contributory infringer""); Brown, 462 F. Supp. 3d at 464 (noting ""there can be no
contributory, vicarious, or inducement of infringement where no direct infringement exists"" and finding that these claims
failed where the defendants had ""successfully invoked the doctrine of fair use"" (first citing Cariou, 714 F.3d at 712 ; and then
citing Fox News Network, LLC, 883 F.3d at 176 )).

ii. Plaintiffs’ right of publicity and unjust enrichment claims are preempted

For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ right of publicity and unjust enrichment claims are
preempted.

1. Taje Monbo's right of publicity claim

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that Taje Monbo, who is featured in an interview excerpted in the 2013 Documentary,
cannot argue that his right of publicity was violated by their use of excerpts of his interview because (1) his claim is based
on material that is subject to copyright, and therefore his claim is preempted under the Copyright Act, and (2) his claim is
untimely. (Defs.' Joint Mem. 31-32, 50-51.)

Plaintiffs, who are domiciled in Maryland, (Am. Compl. ¢§ 18-19), argue that their state law right of publicity claim for the use
of Taje Monbo's image, voice, words, and dirt-bike performance is not preempted because it is ""not equivalent"" to a claim
that could be brought under the Copyright Act. (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 17; Pls.' Suppl. Opp'n 5.)

Maryland courts recognize the tort of appropriation of another's name or likeness if (1) the appropriation is more than
""incidental"" and (2) the likeness is being appropriated for a commercial purpose. 12 See Lawrence v. A.S. Abell Co., 229 Md.
697 , 702-03 (1984); see LTVN Holdings, LLC v. Odeh, No. 09-CV-789, 2010 WL 2612690, at *6 (D. Md. June 25, 2010)
(""Under Maryland law, the right of privacy is invaded when an individual's name or likeness is appropriated for the use or
benefit of another."" (citing Lawrence, 229 Md. at 702 )).

""The Copyright Act exclusively governs a claim when (1) the particular work to which the claim is being applied falls within
the type of works protected by the Copyright Act under 17 U.S.C. §§ 102 and 103, and (2) the claim seeks to vindicate legal
or equitable rights that are equivalent to one of the bundle of exclusive rights already protected by copyright law under 17

U.S.C. § 106."" Universal Instruments Corp. v. Micro Sys. Eng’g, Inc., 924 F.3d 32 , 48 (2d Cir. 2019) (citing Briarpatch Ltd.,
L.P. v. Phoenix Pictures, Inc., 373 F.3d 296 , 305 (2d Cir. 2004)). ""The first prong of this test is called the 'subject matter
requirement,’ and the second prong is called the ‘general scope requirement."" Briarpatch Ltd., L.P., 373 F.3d at 305 (quoting
Nat'l Basketball Ass'n v. Motorola, Inc., 105 F.3d 841 , 848 (2d Cir. 1997)).

[623 F.Supp.3d 108]

The subject matter requirement ""looks at the work that would be affected by the plaintiff's exercise of a state-created right,
and requires (as an essential element of preemption) that the work 'come within the subject matter of copyright as specified
by sections 102 and 103."" ML Genius Holdings LLC v. Google LLC, No. 20-3113, 2022 WL 710744, at *2 (2d Cir. Mar. 10,
2022) (quoting Jackson v. Roberts (In re Jackson), 972 F.3d 25 , 42 (2d Cir. 2020)). This requirement ""is satisfied if the
claim applies to a work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression and falling within the ambit of one of the
categories of copyrightable works."" Briarpatch Ltd., L.P.,373 F.3d at 305 (citing Nat'l Basketball Ass'n_105 F.3d at 848-49 ).
""In analyzing this prong, [courts] focus on 'the gravamen of the claim and the allegations supporting it."""" ML Genius Holdings
LLC, 2022 WL 710744, at *2 (quoting In re Jackson, 972 F.3d at 47 ).

The general scope requirement ""looks at the right being asserted (over a work that comes within the 'subject matter of
copyright’) and requires (for preemption to apply) that the right be ‘equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general
scope of copyright as specified by section 106."" /d. at *3 (quoting In re Jackson,_972 F.3d at 43 ). ""Section 106 of the
Copyright Act ‘defines the ""exclusive rights"" granted by the federal copyright law, which consist of the rights ""to do and to
authorize"" the reproduction, distribution, performance, and display of a work, and the creation of derivative works based on a
work."" /d. (quoting /n re Jackson, 972 F.3d at 43 ). ""The general scope requirement is satisfied only when the state-created
right may be abridged by an act that would, by itself, infringe one of the exclusive rights provided by federal copyright law.""
Id. (quoting Briarpatch Ltd., L.P., 373 F.3d at 305 ); Universal Instruments Corp., 924 F.3d at 48 (""A state law right is
equivalent to one of the exclusive rights of copyright if it may be abridged by an act which, in and of itself, would infringe one
of the exclusive rights."" (quoting Forest Park Pictures v. Universal Television Network, Inc. 683 F.3d 424 , 430 (2d Cir.
2012))). ""For preemption to apply, ‘the state law claim must involve acts of reproduction, adaptation, performance,
distribution or display."""" ML Genius Holdings LLC, 2022 WL 710744, at *3 (quoting Briarpatch Ltd., L.P., 373 F.3d at 305 ).
""Even if a claim otherwise satisfies the general scope requirement, a claim is not preempted if it include[s] any extra



--- Page 21 ---
elements that make it qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim."" /d. (alteration in original) (quoting
Briarpatch Ltd., L.P., 373 F.3d at 305 ); Universal Instruments Corp., 924 F.3d at 48 (""But if an extra element is required
instead of or in addition to the acts of reproduction, performance, distribution or display, in order to constitute a state-created
cause of action,’ there is no preemption."" (quoting Forest Park Pictures, 683 F.3d at 430 )). ""To determine whether a claim is
qualitatively different, [courts] look at what the plaintiff seeks to protect, the theories in which the matter is thought to be
protected and the rights sought to be enforced."" ML Genius Holdings LLC, 2022 WL 710744, at *3 (quoting Briarpatch Ltd.,
L.P.,_373 F.3d at 306 ); Universal Instruments Corp., 924 F.3d at 48 (same). ""The 'extra element’ inquiry is not 'mechanical""
and instead ""requires a holistic evaluation of the nature of the rights sought to be enforced, and a determination whether the
state law action is qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim."" ML Genius Holdings LLC, 2022 WL 710744, at
*3 (quoting /n re Jackson,_972 F.3d at 44 n.17). The Second Circuit has directed courts to ""take a restrictive

[623 F.Supp.3d 109]

view of what extra elements transform an otherwise equivalent claim into one that is qualitatively different from a copyright
claim."" Briarpatch Ltd., L.P.,_373 F.3d at 306 .

The Second Circuit recently analyzed when right of publicity claims are impliedly or expressly preempted under the
Copyright Act. See In re Jackson, 972 F.3d at 25 . Preemption is less favored for right of publicity claims that ""vindicate
substantial state law interests,"" such as those regulating false endorsements or otherwise protecting consumers. /d. at 37-
38. Where there is no such interest, and where a right of publicity suit, ""although ostensibly an invocation of [a plaintiff's]
rights to control the use of his persona in publicity, is so devoid of the substantial interests protected by that right"" that it is
best described as a ""thinly disguised"" copyright claim, id. at 41, such a suit is impliedly preempted, id. at 42. A right of
publicity claim is expressly preempted when the work at issue falls within the Copyright Act and the common-law right
asserted is equivalent to a right asserted under the Copyright Act. /d. at 43 (citing 17 U.S.C § 301(a)). If a claim primarily
concerns a person's likeness, that fact weighs against preemption, but if the claim instead arises from ""the reproduction or
dissemination of the work itself (as opposed to the persona of the plaintiff), it is more likely to be preempted. /d. at 49-50 (""
[T]he more the defendant has used a copyrighted work for its own value, as opposed to using it to exploit the depicted
plaintiff's identity, the more the right of publicity claim brought by someone depicted in the work can be considered a
disguised effort to control the dissemination of the work."").

Taje Monbo's right of publicity claim is both expressly and impliedly preempted because it concerns the Joint Moving
Defendants’ use of his image. The challenged excerpts, which feature portions of an interview with Taje Monbo, are also
covered by Plaintiffs’ copyright claim. The Joint Moving Defendants’ excerpt of the 2001 Documentary does not imply that
Taje Monbo endorsed the 2013 Documentary. In the context of the film, it is unambiguous that he is depicted in an excerpt
from the 2001 Documentary. /d. at 37 (""Some right of publicity claims, for example, target false endorsements, and as such
vindicate a state's interest in ‘prevent[ing] consumer confusion."" (alteration in original) (quoting_Bonito Boats. Inc. v. Thunder
Craft Boats, Inc.. 489 U.S. 141 , 154, 109 S.Ct. 971 , 103 L.Ed.2d 118 (1989) )). The excerpts are neither derogatory nor an
invasion of Taje Monbo's privacy, and he does not allege that they are. The use of his image at issue appears in the 2001
Documentary, which Taje Monbo himself chose to film and sell. See id. at 39 (finding that ""[the defendant's] reference to [a
recording artist's musical] persona [is not] in any way derogatory, or an invasion of [the artist's] privacy"" where [the
defendant] released a mixtape that included a sample of [the artist's] work). As the Second Circuit warned in Jackson, this
use of a right of publicity suit ""could substantially interfere with the utilization of a work in ways explicitly permitted by the
Copyright Act, such as for uses that would qualify as fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107."" /d. at 40.

Accordingly, this claim ""does not seek to vindicate any substantial state interests distinct from those furthered by the
copyright law"" and is preempted by the Copyright Act. See id. at 39.

2. Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ common law unjust enrichment claim is preempted by the Copyright Act
because it is based on their use of his image without his knowledge or consent,

[623 F.Supp.3d 110]
which are the same facts underlying Plaintiffs’ copyright claim. (Defs.' Joint Mem. 32-33.)

Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Moving Defendants have been unjustly enriched by their ""use of Plaintiffs' movie title card, clips
and excerpts and the character named Pug,"" as well as by their use of Taje Monbo's ""image, actual voice, words and
performance"" in the 2013 Documentary. (Am. Compl. § 261.) In response to the Joint Moving Defendants' preemption
arguments, Plaintiffs do not make any arguments regarding their allegations that the Joint Moving Defendants were unjustly
enriched by their ""use of Plaintiffs’ movie title card, clips and excerpts and the character named Pug,"" ( id. ), but argue that
their unjust enrichment claim is not preempted because the Joint Moving Defendants used and profited from using Taje
Monbo's ""image, actual voice, words, and performance"" without requesting permission or compensating him. 2° (Pls.' Opp'n
to Defs.' Joint Mot. 17-18.)

A. Choice of law analysis


--- Page 22 ---
""Under the law of New York, the forum state, the first step in a choice of law analysis is to determine whether an actual
conflict exists between the laws of the jurisdictions involved."" Forest Park Pictures, 683 F.3d at 433 (citing /n re Allstate Ins.
Co. (Stolarz), 81 N.Y.2d 219 , 223, 597 N.Y.S.2d 904 , 613 N.E.2d 936 (1993) ); see also Kinsey v. N.Y. Times Co., 991
F.3d 171 , 176 (2d Cir. 2021). Where there is no conflict, ""a New York court will dispense with choice of law analysis; and if
New York law is among the relevant choices, New York courts are free to apply it.""_/nt'! Bus. Machs. Corp. v. Liberty Mut.
Ins. Co., 363 F.3d 137 , 143 (2d Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).

In the context of unjust enrichment claims, courts applying New York choice of law rules must decide whether to apply the
""center of gravity"" choice of law test, which applies to contract disputes, or the ""interest analysis"" test, which applies to tort
disputes. Gerloff v. Hostetter Schneider Realty, No. 12-CV-9404, 2014 WL 1099814, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2014)
(""Whether to apply to an unjust enrichment claim New York's 'center of gravity’ choice of law test applicable to contract
disputes, or New York's 'interest analysis’ test applicable to tort claims, is a matter of debate among district courts in this
Circuit.""). In deciding which test to apply, courts look to whether a claim sounds in tort or in contract. See id. (holding that ""a
claim for unjust enrichment based on a fraudulent conveyance by a debtor ... sound[ed] more in fraud than in contract,"" and
therefore the interest analysis test was appropriate); Grund v. Del. Charter Guar. & Tr. Co.,_788 F. Supp. 2d 226 , 251 n.9
(S.D.N.Y. 2011) (""Under New York choice of law rules, interest analysis is applied to claims arising in equity, such as claims
for unjust enrichment.""). 2+

[623 F.Supp.3d 111]

""New York courts confronted with a choice of law issue in torts conduct an ‘interest analysis,’ assessing which of the
competing jurisdictions has the greatest interest in seeing its law applied to the matter at issue."" Stichting Ter Behartiging
Van de Belangen Van Oudaandeelhouders In Het Kapitaal Van Saybolt Int'l B.V. v. Schreiber, 407 F.3d 34 , 50 (2d Cir.
2005) (quoting Padula v. Lilarn Prop. Corp., 84 N.Y.2d 519 , 521,620 N.Y.S.2d 310 , 644 N.E.2d 1001 (1994) ); see also
Kinsey, 991 F.3d at 176 (""In tort cases, New York ‘applies the law of the state with the most significant interest in the
litigation."" (quoting_Lee v. Bankers Tr. Co.. 166 F.3d 540 , 545 (2d Cir. 1999))). ""[T]he interest analysis is applied differently
depending on whether the rules in question are conduct-regulating rules that people use as a guide to governing their
primary conduct,' or loss-allocating rules that ‘prohibit, assign, or limit liability after the tort occurs."" Licci ex rel. Licci v.
Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 739 F.3d 45 , 49 (2d Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (quotingLicci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese
Canadian Bank, SAL, 672 F.3d 155 , 158 (2d Cir. 2012)). New York choice of law rules consider publicity torts to be conduct-
regulating. Locke v. Aston, 31 A.D.3d 33 , 814 N.Y.S.2d 38 , 42 (App. Div. 2006); see also Fargas v. Cincinnati Mach., LLC.
986 F. Supp. 2d 420 , 423 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (""Conduct-regulating rules are defined as those that 'have the prophylactic effect
of governing conduct to prevent injuries from occurring."" (quoting Padula, 84 N.Y.2d at 522 , 620 N.Y.S.2d 310 , 644 N.E.2d
1001 )). When a conduct-regulating rule is at issue, ""the law of the jurisdiction where the [allegedly tortious acts] occurred
will generally apply because that jurisdiction has the greatest interest in regulating behavior within its borders."" Licci,_739
F.3d at 49 & n.3 (alteration in original) (collecting cases); see also Bullock v. Caesars Ent. Corp., 83 F. Supp. 3d 420, 423
(E.D.N.Y. 2015) (noting that when a conduct-regulating rule is at issue, ""the law of the place of the tort 'will usually have a
predominant, if not exclusive, concern"" (quoting Padula, 84 N.Y.2d at 522 , 620 N.Y.S.2d 310 , 644 N.E.2d 1001 )).

A choice-of-law analysis is necessary for Plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim because an actual conflict exists between the
relevant Maryland and New York unjust enrichment laws. In Maryland, unjust enrichment requires (1) ""[a] benefit conferred
upon the defendant by the plaintiff,"" (2) ""[a]n appreciation or knowledge by the defendant of the benefit,"" and (3) ""[t]he
acceptance or retention by the defendant of the benefit by the defendant under such circumstances as to make it inequitable
for the defendant to retain the benefit without the payment of its value."" MAS Assocs., LLC v. Korotki,_ 475 Md. 325 , 380
n.18, 257 A.3d 553 (2021) (quoting_Hill v. Cross Country Settlements, LLC, 402 Md. 281 , 295, 936 A.2d 343 (2007) ).
However, ""[t]o prevail on a claim for unjust enrichment in New York, a plaintiff must establish (1) that the defendant
benefitted; (2) at the plaintiff's expense; and (3) that 'equity and good conscience’ require restitution."" Green Tree Servicing,
LLC v. Christodoulakis, 689 F. App'x 66, 70 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Kaye v. Grossman, 202 F.3d 611 , 616 (2d Cir. 2000));
Fin. Assistance, Inc. v. Graham, 143 N.Y.S.3d 380 , 385, 191 A.D.3d 952 (App. Div. 2021) (same). In addition, under New
York law, ""while ‘a plaintiff need not be in privity with the defendant

[623 F.Supp.3d 112]

to state a claim for unjust enrichment,’ there must exist a relationship or connection between the parties that is not 'too
attenuated."" Ga. Malone & Co. v. Rieder, 19 N.Y.3d 511 , 516, 950 N.Y.S.2d 333 , 973 N.E.2d 743 (2012) (quoting_Sperry v.
Crompton Corp., 8 N.Y.3d 204 , 215-16, 831 N.Y.S.2d 760 , 863 N.E.2d 1012 (2007) ). Unlike a claim for unjust enrichment
under Maryland law, New York law does not require ""an appreciation or knowledge by the defendant of the benefit,"" MAS
Assocs., LLC, 475 Md. at 380 n.18, 257 A.3d 553 , but does require ""allegations ... that would indicate a relationship
between the parties,"" Ga. Malone & Co., 19 N.Y.3d at 517 , 950 N.Y.S.2d 333 , 973 N.E.2d 743 (quoting Mandarin Trading
Ltd. v. Wildenstein, 16 N.Y.3d 173 , 182,919 N.Y.S.2d 465 , 944 N.E.2d 1104 (2011) ). Because these differences have ""a
significant possible effect on the outcome of the trial,"" a choice of law analysis is appropriate. Simon v. Philip Morris Inc.

124 F. Supp. 2d 46 , 71 (E.D.N.Y. 2000).

As noted above, Plaintiffs’ claim resembles a tort claim more than a contract claim. Therefore, the Court applies the ""interest


--- Page 23 ---
analysis"" test. Because publicity torts are conduct-regulating rules and the 2013 Documentary was filmed in Maryland, the
Court applies Maryland law to the unjust enrichment claim. See Velon v. Di Modolo Int'l LLC, No. 653485/2013, 2014 N.Y.
Misc. LEXIS 2297 (Sup. Ct. May 16, 2014) (applying interest analysis test to unjust enrichment claim ""related to
unauthorized use of a person's image or likeness"" and applying New York law where images were created in New York).

B. Analysis of Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim

The Copyright Act preempts Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim. Plaintiffs’ claim is based on the Joint Moving Defendants’
use in the 2013 Documentary of the title card and clips from the 2001 Documentary, which, as a motion picture or other
audiovisual work, is within the scope of the Copyright Act, satisfying the subject matter requirement of the preemption test.
See 17 U.S.C. § 102(6) (copyright protection extends to ""motion pictures and other audiovisual works""); see also, e.g.,
Genius Media Grp. v. Google LLC, No. 19-CV-7279, 2020 WL 5553639, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2020) (""Because the
‘gravamen' of [the] [p]laintiff's unjust enrichment claims is that [the] [dJefendants were unjustly enriched by their use of [the]
[p]laintiff's lyric transcriptions — work that, as discussed above, is within the scope of the Copyright Act — these claims are
preempted.""), aff'd sub nom. ML Genius Holdings LLC v. Google LLC, No. 20-3113, 2022 WL 710744 (2d Cir. Mar. 10,
2022).

As to the general scope requirement of the preemption test, based on Plaintiffs' theory of their claim — that the Joint Moving
Defendants were unjustly enriched by using the title card and clips from the 2001 Documentary in the 2013 Documentary,
including clips featuring Taje Monbo — the rights they seek to enforce are rights ""equivalent to ... exclusive rights within the
general scope of copyright as specified by section 106."" ML Genius Holdings LLC, 2022 WL 710744, at *3 (quoting /n re
Jackson, 972 F.3d at 43 ); see U.S. Tennis Ass'n, Inc. v. VSW Prods. LLC, No. 13-CV-4124, 2013 WL 12195853, at *4
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 6, 2013) (noting that ""unjust enrichment claims generally involve no more than the ‘act of reproduction,
adaptation, performance, distribution or display’ that the Copyright Act already covers"" (quoting Briarpatch Ltd., L.P., 373
F.3d at 305-06 )). Indeed, the Second Circuit has held that an unjust enrichment claim premised on the defendant's
adaptation of a movie from the plaintiff's novel

[623 F.Supp.3d 113]

and screenplay was preempted by the Copyright Act because the state-law claim involved copyrightable work and was not
""qualitatively different"" from a copyright claim. Briarpatch Ltd., L.P.,373 F.3d at 306 (considering New York unjust
enrichment law); see also U.S. Tennis Ass'n, Inc., 2013 WL 12195853, at *4 (""[T]he rights [the] [p]laintiff seems intent on
protecting in the unjust enrichment count involve the reproduction and adaptation of its copyrighted broadcasts, rights
protected by 17 U.S.C. § 106."").

Moreover, although Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Moving Defendants were unjustly enriched, this does not make their unjust
enrichment claim ""qualitatively different"" from a copyright infringement claim. The Second Circuit has held that ""[wJhile
enrichment is not required for copyright infringement,"" it does ""not ... go[] far enough to make the unjust enrichment claim
qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim."" Briarpatch Ltd., L.P., 373 F.3d at 306 ; see also Forest Park
Pictures, 683 F.3d at 432 (""Under these quasi-contractual theories, [such as unjust enrichment,] the plaintiff need only prove
that the defendant was unjustly enriched through the use of her idea or work. Such a claim is not materially different from a
claim for copyright infringement that requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant used, reproduced, copied, or displayed a
copyrighted work.""); U.S. Tennis Ass'n, Inc., 2013 WL 12195853, at *4 (noting that ""additional burden [of proving enrichment]
does not render the state law claim ‘qualitatively different"" and finding claim preempted where the plaintiff alleged ""only that
[the] [dJefendants were enriched from their unauthorized use of its broadcasts, a claim equivalent to the assertion of
damages from the copying of materials protected by the Copyright Act""); Stadt v. Fox News Network LLC, 719 F. Supp. 2d
312 , 321-22 & 322 n.64 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (""[T]he Second Circuit and courts in this district have consistently held that this
enrichment element does not suffice to shield an unjust enrichment claim from preemption when the claim arises from
unauthorized use of a copyrighted work."" (collecting cases)). This is because, ""[l]ike the elements of awareness or intent,""
which are also elements of a Maryland unjust enrichment claim but which Plaintiffs do not plead, ""the enrichment element...
limits the scope of the claim but leaves its fundamental nature unaltered."" Briarpatch Lid., L.P., 373 F.3d at 306 . Thus, ""
[w]here the gravamen of an unjust enrichment claim is that defendants ‘unjustly benefitted from unauthorized use’ of a work
within the scope of the Copyright Act... the claim is preempted."" Stanacard, LLC v. Rubard, LLC, No. 12-CV-5176, 2016 WL
462508, at *22 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 2016) (quoting Einiger v. Citigroup, Inc., No. 14-CV-4570, 2014 WL 4494139, at *6
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2014)); see also U.S. Tennis Ass'n, Inc., 2013 WL 12195853, at *4 (""The overwhelming majority of
courts in this circuit have held that an unjust enrichment claim based upon the copying of subject matter within the scope of
the Copyright Act is preempted."" (quoting Boyle v. Stephens Inc., No. 97-CV-1351, 1998 WL 690816, at “5-6 (S.D.N.Y.

Plaintiffs do not allege any extra element other than enrichment that differs from a copyright claim. Cf. Briarpatch Ltd., L.P.,
373 F.3d at 306 (explaining ""a state law claim is qualitatively different"" for Copyright Act preemption purposes ""if it requires
such elements as breach of fiduciary duty or possession and control of chattels"" (citation omitted)). Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
unjust enrichment claim is

[623 F.Supp.3d 114]

preempted by the Copyright Act. 22 Schleifer v. Berns, No. 17-CV-1649, 2017 WL 3084406, at *5 n.2 (E.D.N.Y. July 19,


--- Page 24 ---
2017) (""[l]t is well-settled that a claim for unjust enrichment is preempted by the Copyright Act."").

Accordingly, the Court grants the Joint Moving Defendants summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ right of publicity and unjust
enrichment claims. 23

iii. Plaintiffs’ Lanham Act claims of trademark infringement, false designation of origin, unfair competition,
trademark dilution, and cybersquatting, state law claims of trademark infringement, false advertising, and unfair
competition, and claims of contributory and vicarious infringement fail

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ trademark claims fail: (1) because their Lanham Act claims, as well as
their claims under Maryland law, are untimely; (2) as a matter of law under_Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film
Corp., 539 U.S. 23 , 123 S.Ct. 2041 , 156 L.Ed.2d 18 (2003) ; (3) under the doctrine of nominative fair use because the title
card was used to describe the actual video that Pug was watching; (4) because the mark, which is based on the ""12
O'Clock"" term, is merely descriptive; and (5) under the First Amendment, because the title was used on artistic grounds.
(Defs.' Joint Mem. 33-44, 52-53.) The Joint Moving Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs fail to state a dilution claim because
they do not have a famous mark, ( id. at 44-45), and that their contributory and vicarious trademark infringement claims fail
because their direct infringement claims fail, ( id. at 54). Because Plaintiffs' opposition to the Joint Moving Defendants’
motion ignores these arguments, the Joint Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs therefore abandon these claims. 24( See
Defs.' Joint Reply 6-7.)

Plaintiffs bring claims of (1) trademark infringement under section 32(1) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1), (Am.
Compl. 9] 225-226), based on the Joint Moving Defendants’ use of their marks in connection with the 2013 Documentary
and (2) trademark infringement, false designation

[623 F.Supp.3d 115]

of origin, passing off, and unfair competition under section 43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A), based
on the Joint Moving Defendants’ use of the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boys"" as the title for the 2013 Documentary and use of the
title card stating ""12 O'Clock Boyz, Inc. presents The Official 12 O'Clock Boyz"" in the 2013 documentary, ( id. {{ 103-106,
228-229). In addition, Plaintiffs allege (1) trademark dilution under section 43(c) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c),
based on the Joint Moving Defendants' casting of other dirt-bike riders as ""12 O'Clock Boys,"" ( id. 4 104, 231-235); (2)
cybersquatting under section 43(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d), based on the Joint Moving Defendants’ use of
the 120clockboys.com domain, registered on January 9, 2013, ( id. { 107, 236-241; Domain Registration, annexed to Am.
Compl. as Ex. 39, Docket Entry No. 99-1, at 98); and (3) state law claims of (a) trademark infringement under Maryland
Code Business Regulation § 1-414 et seq., (Am. Compl. {| 242-243), and (b) trademark infringement, false advertising, and
unfair competition under the Maryland common law, ( id. { 246-248). Finally, Plaintiffs allege federal and Maryland common
law claims of (1) contributory trademark infringement, ( id. (249-253), and (2) vicarious trademark infringement, ( id. 14
254-259). ( See alsoPls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 3 (listing claims).) Plaintiffs do not respond to the Joint Moving
Defendants’ arguments on the merits of their claims.

1. Plaintiffs' claims are untimely

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ (1) trademark infringement claims under section 1114(1) of the Lanham
Act are untimely because they accrued before Plaintiffs registered their marks in July of 2016 and Plaintiffs cannot recover
for retroactive registration of trademarks, (Defs.' Joint Mem. 33-34); (2) trademark infringement, false designation of origin,
unfair competition, trademark dilution, and cybersquatting claims under section 1125 of the Lanham Act are untimely and
barred by laches; and (3) state law trademark claims are untimely under Maryland's three-year statute of limitations because
they accrued no later than when Plaintiffs sent them a cease-and-desist letter on October 20, 2014, more than three years
before they brought suit, ( id. at 52-54).

Plaintiffs argue that the Joint Moving Defendants' ""infringement activity is ongoing,"" and therefore, ""even assuming a statute
of limitations defense may bar some portion of Plaintiffs' trademark infringement claims], Plaintiffs would still be entitled to
pursue damages based on the infringement activity that occurred within the statute of limitations period."" (Pls.' Opp'n to

Defs.' Joint Mot. 12 (quoting Sonoma Foods, Inc. v. Sonoma Cheese Factory, LLC, No. 07-CV-554, 2008 WL 913279, at *2
(N.D. Cal. Apr. 3, 2008)).)

A. Plaintiffs' Lanham Act claims based on their registered marks are time-barred

""Section 32(1) of the [Lanham] Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1) ... protects only registered trademarks."" Fed. Treasury Enter.
Sojuzplodoimport v. Spirits Int'l B.V., 726 F.3d 62 , 72 (2d Cir. 2013). This section ""provides a cause of action against any
person who 'use[s] in commerce any ... imitation of a registered mark ... likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to
deceive."" /d. (alteration in original) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)). Courts in this Circuit and others have held that a plaintiff
cannot recover for infringement of a registered mark based on conduct that occurred prior to the plaintiff's registration of its
mark. See, e.g., Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. Armstrong Interactive, Inc., No. 18-CV-6117,

[623 F.Supp.3d 116]
2019 WL 3890138, at *5 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 2019) (""[T]here is no potential for [the defendants] to recover... for conduct

that occurred prior to the registration of the subject marks."" (quoting Synergy Tech & Design, Inc. v. Terry, No. 06-CV-2073,
2007 WL 1288464, at *4-5 (N.D. Cal. May 2, 2007))); Sly Mag., LLC v. Weider Publ'ns L.L.C., 529 F. Supp. 2d 425 , 431 n.1
(S.D.N.Y. 2007) (noting at summary judgment that the court previously denied the plaintiff's motion to amend to add a claim
for infringement of its newly registered mark because ""the law does not permit direct liability based upon retroactive
registration""), affd, 346 F. App'x 721 (2d Cir. 2009); Sly Mag., LLC v. Weider Publ'ns L.L.C., 241 F.R.D. 527, 530 (S.D.N.Y.

uncovered no authority that supports [a] theory of retroactive registration."").

Plaintiffs have been using their 12 O'Clock Boyz mark since 2001 but did not register the phrase or any marks until July of
2016. (Trademark Registration; Am. Compl. § 128-131.) As the Joint Moving Defendants argue, Plaintiffs cannot
retroactively recover for acts that occurred before they registered their mark. See, e.g., Viacom Int'l, Inc., 2019 WL 3890138,
at *5 n.3 (collecting cases). Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Moving Defendants committed trademark infringement in violation
of 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1) by using and continuing to use ""reproductions, copies, and colorable imitations of Plaintiffs’ registered
12 O'Clock Boyz [mJarks"" in connection with the 2013 Documentary, (Am. Compl. § 226), however all of the allegedly
infringing acts on which Plaintiffs' base their federal claims — the Joint Moving Defendants’ use of the 12 O'Clock Boyz mark
as the title for the 2013 Documentary, use of the 2001 Documentary's title card, casting of other dirt-bike riders, and
registration of the domain name 12oclockboys.com, ( id. §§ 103-107) — are acts that occurred prior to Plaintiffs’
registrations, as evidenced both by Plaintiffs’ allegations and the attachments to the Amended Complaint, ( see, e.g., Am.
Compl. 80-84 (exhibit list describing exhibits and providing relevant dates)). Plaintiffs' exhibits demonstrate that, after
learning of the Joint Moving Defendants’ alleged infringement in or around 2013, Plaintiffs sought to protect their marks by
registering them before commencing this action. ( See Letter Dated Oct. 20, 2014 (""Oct. 20, 2014 Letter""), annexed to Am.
Compl. as Ex. 35, Docket Entry No. 99-1, at 83 (cease-and-desist letter asserting common law rights in the marks prior to
registration).) Plaintiffs’ trademark infringement claims under the Lanham Act based on their registered marks are therefore
time-barred. 25

[623 F.Supp.3d 117]
B. Plaintiffs’ Lanham Act claims based on common law rights in their marks are barred by laches

Even construing Plaintiffs’ arguments and allegations as contending that they acquired common law rights in their marks
based on their use of the marks since 2001, and that they may therefore pursue timely claims based on their common law
rights under section 43 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 11285, including their claims for trademark infringement, false
designation of origin, unfair competition, trademark dilution, and cybersquatting, such claims are barred by laches.

Unlike section 32(1) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1), which ""protects only registered trademarks, ... [s]ection 43 of
the [Lanham] Act[, 15 U.S.C. § 11285] ... allows suits 'by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged’
by the defendant's actions."" Spirits Int'l B. V., 726 F.3d at 72 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)). The Lanham Act ""contains no
statute of limitations"" but ""expressly provides for defensive use of ‘equitable principles, including laches."" Petrella, 572 U.S.
at 678 n.15, 134 S.Ct. 1962 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(9)). A party asserting laches must establish: ""[(1)] that [the] plaintiff
had knowledge of [the] defendant's use of its marks, [(2)] that [the] plaintiff inexcusably delayed in taking action with respect
thereto, and [(3)] that [the] defendant will be prejudiced by permitting [the] plaintiff inequitably to assert its rights at this time.""

1992), rev'd on other grounds, _7 F.3d 1130 (4th Cir. 1993) ). Federal law determines when a Lanham Act claim accrues and
provides that the ""laches clock begins to run when the trademark owner ‘knew or should have known, not simply that [the

infringer] was using the potentially offending mark, but that [it] had a provable infringement claim against [the infringer]."""" Or.

Time Prods., B.V., 17 F.3d 38 , 44 (2d Cir. 1994)).

The most analogous Maryland statute of limitations is shorter than the most analogous New York statute, and the Court
therefore applies it to Plaintiffs' Lanham Act claims. As noted above, based on the record before the Court, the latest date
for accrual of these claims is October 20, 2014 — the date Plaintiffs sent a letter to the Joint Moving Defendants setting forth
their purported common law claims based on the alleged infringing acts. (Oct. 20, 2014 Letter.) Because Plaintiffs
commenced this action on October 23, 2018, more than a year after Maryland's applicable three-year statute of limitations
expired, a presumption of laches arises and ""the burden shifts to [Plaintiff] to show why laches should not apply."" Spirits Int'l
B.V., 809 F.3d at 746 . Plaintiffs, however, did not respond to the Joint Moving Defendants' arguments or provide any
evidence to carry this burden, despite notice of the Joint Moving Defendants' argument and of the Court's intention to
convert their joint motion into a summary judgment motion. As a result, it is not inequitable to apply the doctrine of laches to
heir case, and their federal claims based on any common law rights they may have acquired are barred. See RBC Nice
Bearings, Inc., 410 F. App'x at 365-66 (affirming finding that laches barred trademark claims where presumption of laches
applied and the plaintiff failed to offer evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption).

However, in light of Plaintiffs’ pro se status, and because this bar is equitable rather than statutory, the Court considers the
merits of their Lanham Act claims under 15 U.S.C. § 1125 below.

C. Plaintiffs’ state law trademark claims are time-barred

Because Maryland's three-year statute of limitations applies to Plaintiffs' state law claims under both Maryland Code
Business Regulation § 1-414 et seq. and the

623 F.Supp.3d 119]

Maryland common law, Plaintiffs' state law claims are time-barred. See, e.g., De Simone v. VSL Pharms., Inc., 352 F. Supp.
3d 471, 487 (D. Md. 2018) (""[C]ivil suits must be filed within three years from the date the action accrues."").

2. Plaintiffs' Lanham Act claims under 15 U.S.C. § 1125 also fail on the merits

Plaintiffs' Lanham Act claims under 15 U.S.C. § 1125 — including their claims of trademark infringement, false designation
of origin, and unfair competition based on the Joint Moving Defendants’ use of the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boys"" as the title for
the 2013 Documentary and use of the 2001 Documentary's title card in the 2013 Documentary, their trade dilution claim,
and their cybersquatting claim — in addition to being barred by laches, also fail on the merits.

A. Trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition claims under the Lanham Act

Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Moving Defendants committed trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair
competition in violation of section 43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C § 1125(a)(1)(A), by using the phrase ""12 O'Clock
Boys"" as the title of the 2013 Documentary and by using the title card of the documentary. (Am. Compl. ¢§ 105-106, 229.)
The Court considers the claims separately.

(1) Plaintiffs’ claims based on the Joint Moving Defendants' use of the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boys"" as a title fail

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the First Amendment under_Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875
F.2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989) , because the use of the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boys"" in the film's title ""has artistic relevance to the
underlying work, merely describes the subject of the Documentary, and does not explicitly mislead as to its source and/or
content."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 41-44.)

""Because of an author's significant First Amendment interest in choosing an appropriate title for his or her work, [the Second


--- Page 27 ---
Circuit has] held that literary titles do not violate the Lanham Act 'unless the title has no artistic relevance to the underlying
work whatsoever, or, if it has some artistic relevance, unless the title explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of
the work."" Twin Peaks Prods., 996 F.2d at 1369 (quoting Rogers, 875 F.2d at 999 ); Rogers, 875 F.2d at 999 (""Because
overextension of Lanham Act restrictions in the area of titles might intrude on First Amendment values, [courts] must
construe the Act narrowly to avoid such a conflict.""); see also Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publ'g Grp., 886
F.2d 490 , 495 (2d Cir. 1989) (noting that Rogers test is ""generally applicable to Lanham Act claims against works of artistic
expression""). ""The threshold for ‘artistic relevance’ is purposely low and will be satisfied unless the use 'has no artistic
relevance to the underlying work whatsoever."" Louis Vuitton Mallatier S.A. v. Warner Bros. Ent. Inc., 868 F. Supp. 2d 172 ,
178 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Rogers,_875 F.2d at 999 ). Whether a title is explicitly misleading is determined ""by application
of the venerable Polaroid factors."" Twin Peaks Prods., 996 F.2d at 1379 (citing Cliffs Notes, Inc., 886 F.2d at 495 n.3). The""
Polaroid factors,"" articulated in Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287 F.2d 492 , 495 (2d Cir. 1961), area
nonexclusive list of eight factors that courts balance to evaluate the likelihood of confusion. See Tiffany & Co. v. Costco
Wholesale Corp., 971 F.3d 74 , 84 (2d Cir. 2020). The factors include:

[623 F.Supp.3d 120]

(1) the strength of the trademark; (2) the degree of similarity between the plaintiff's mark and the defendant's
allegedly imitative use; (3) the proximity of the products and their competitiveness with each other; (4) the
likelihood that the plaintiff will ""bridge the gap"" by developing a product for sale in the defendant's market; (5)
evidence of actual consumer confusion; (6) evidence that the defendant adopted the imitative term in bad faith;
(7) the respective quality of the products; and (8) the sophistication of the relevant population of consumers.

Id. at 84-85 (first citing Polaroid, 287 F.2d at 495 ; and then citing Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc., 588 F.3d
97 , 115 (2d Cir. 2009)). The ""evaluation of the Polaroid factors is not a mechanical process where the party with the
greatest number of factors weighing in its favor wins. Rather, a court should focus on the ultimate question of whether
consumers are likely to be confused."" /d. at 85 (quoting Nabisco, Inc. v. Warner-Lambert Co., 220 F.3d 43 , 46 (2d Cir.
2000)). ""The pertinence of individual factors varies with the facts of the particular case.""_Guthrie Healthcare Sys. v.
ContextMedia, Inc., 826 F.3d 27 , 37 (2d Cir. 2016) (same). Nevertheless, ""it is incumbent upon the district judge to engage
in a deliberate review of each factor, and, if a factor is inapplicable to a case, to explain why."" Arrow Fastener Co. v. Stanley
Works, 59 F.3d 384 , 400 (2d Cir. 1995) (citing Thompson Med. Co. v. Pfizer, Inc., 753 F.2d 208 , 214 (2d Cir. 1985)). ""[T]he
finding of likelihood of confusion must be particularly compelling to outweigh the First Amendment interest recognized in
Rogers."" Twin Peaks Prods., 996 F.2d at 1379 . ""The question then is whether the title is misleading in the sense that it
induces members of the public to believe [the work] was prepared or otherwise authorized by [the plaintiff]."" /d.

The Joint Moving Defendants’ use of the title ""12 O'Clock Boys"" for their documentary meets the low threshold for artistic
relevance to the documentary's content, as it is relevant to the film's story of how Plaintiffs' works inspired Pug. See Rogers,
875 F.2d at 1001 (finding that the defendant satisfied artistic relevance prong where its use of the trademark was ""not
arbitrarily chosen just to exploit the publicity value of [the plaintiffs’ mark] but instead ha[d] genuine relevance to the film's
story"").

In addition, the title is not explicitly misleading as to the source or content of the documentary under the Polaroid factors.
Prior to its registration, Plaintiffs'""12 O'Clock Boyz"" mark appears to have been descriptive and thus not particularly strong. (
See Oct. 20, 2014 Letter; Am. Compl. 4 40 (stating that ""12 O'Clock Boyz"" is ""a phrase coined by Taje to describe the way in
which riders would elevate the front of their bikes and ride only on the back wheels until their bikes would be perpendicular

‘0 the road or in the '12 O'Clock' position"").) Compare Lois Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc. v. Levi Strauss & Co., 799 F.2d 867 ,
871 (2d Cir. 1986) (""[R]egistered trademarks are presumed to be distinctive ....""), with Lane Cap. Mamt.. Inc. v. Lane Cap.
Mamt., Inc., 192 F.3d 337 , 344 (2d Cir. 1999) (explaining that descriptive marks are not inherently strong or ""distinctive"").
The marks are similar, and the parties are in proximate areas of commerce, as Plaintiffs sell accessories associated with
heir group, including their documentaries, and the Joint Moving Defendants sell the 2013 Documentary. See Lang v. Ret.
Living Publ'g Co., 949 F.2d 576 , 582 (2d Cir. 1991) (""To the extent goods ... serve the same purpose, fall within the same
general class, or are used together, the use of similar designations is more likely to cause confusion.""). However, the gap
between these areas of activity has already been bridged, making

623 F.Supp.3d 121]

his factor irrelevant. Star Indus., Inc. v. Bacardi & Co., 412 F.3d 373 , 387 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that where ""products are
already in competitive proximity, there is really no gap to bridge, and this factor is irrelevant to the Polaroid analysis in this
case""). In addition, Plaintiffs do not allege and have not provided any evidence of actual consumer confusion, which is
relevant because both products have been in the marketplace since 2013. Cf. Hasbro, Inc. v. Lanard Toys. Ltd., 858 F.2d 70
, 78 (2d Cir. 1988) (finding that ""[t]he magistrate [judge] properly declined to make any negative inference"" from a lack of
confusion because the defendant's product had been on the market a ""short time""). In addition, although Plaintiffs allege bad
faith, the evidence shows that after they contacted Oscilloscope to inform them of their alleged trademark infringement
claims, Oscilloscope responded indicating that ""[p]rior to the release of the [2013 Documentary,] extensive copyright and
trademark searches were conducted and no references to your alleged trademark were uncovered,"" as the trademark ""was
registered long after the production of the film."" (Oscilloscope Letter dated Nov. 21, 2017, annexed to Am. Compl. as Ex. 36,



--- Page 28 ---
Docket Entry No. 99-1, at 87.) Further, the 2013 Documentary is a higher quality production, which weighs against a finding
that confusion is likely. See Arrow Fastener Co., 59 F.3d at 398 (""This factor is primarily concerned with whether the [first
user's reputation could be jeopardized by virtue of the fact that the [second] user's product is of inferior quality."") (citing Lois
Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc.,799 F.2d at 875 ). Finally, the relevant consumer group is assumed to be relatively unsophisticated
because the item at issue, a film, is inexpensive and marketed to the general class of consumers rather than to experts. See
Lever Bros. Co. v. Am. Bakeries Co., 693 F.2d 251 , 259 (2d Cir. 1982) (""The ordinary purchaser of bread and margarine is
a casual buyer, and the bustling, self-service atmosphere of a typical supermarket makes careful examination of products
unlikely....""); cf Arrow Fastener Co., 59 F.3d at 399 (finding that ""[a] consumer [of pneumatic staplers] who ... possess[ed
[a] high level of knowledge, and who [was] also paying a substantial amount of money for the product, [was] not likely to be
confused by"" a common term in the model number).

Based on the Polaroid factors, there is not a ""particularly compelling"" likelihood of confusion, and, therefore, the title is no!
explicitly misleading as to the source or content of the documentary. In addition, even if a significant number of consumers
would not pay attention to the end credits of the 2013 Documentary, see Brown v. Showtime Networks, Inc., 394 F. Supp.
3d 418, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), the end credits, as well as the promotional materials for the 2013 Documentary attached to the
Amended Complaint as exhibits, clearly indicate that the producers of the 2013 Documentary are not the individuals who
produced Plaintiffs’ films, 28 see, e.g., Medina v. Dash Films, Inc., No. 15-CV-2551, 2016 WL 3906714, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July
14, 2016) (noting that ""[c]lonsumers expect a

[623 F.Supp.3d 122]

title to communicate a message about the... movie, but they do not expect it to identify the publisher or producer,"" and that ""
[t]his is particularly true where ‘'[the] defendants employed their own source designations elsewhere on the product™ and
""materials promoting the film prominently informed the reader"" who the producers were (first quoting Mattel. Inc. v. MCA
Records, Inc., 296 F.3d 894 , 902 (9th Cir. 2002); and then quotingAin Tin Tin, Inc. v. First Look Studios, Inc., 671 F. Supp.
2d 893 , 901 (S.D. Tex. 2009))).

Accordingly, the Court grants the Joint Moving Defendants summary judgment as to Plaintiffs’ trademark infringement, false
designation of origin, and unfair competition claims based on the use of Plaintiffs’ mark in the title of the 2013 Documentary.
See Medina, 2016 WL 3906714, at *5-6 (dismissing federal and state law claims under 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1) and 1125(a)
where the title ""Loisaidas' clearly ha[d] artistic relevance"" to the work, which was ""a series of short films about drug
dealers... in Manhattan's Lower East Side,"" as ""Loisaidas ... is the Spanish slang term for ‘lower east siders,"" ""[t]he
characters repeatedly refer to people and places ‘downtown in Loisaidas,"" and ""scenes are identifiably set in the Lower East
Side,"" and finding no likelihood of confusion given explicit source designations).

(2) The Joint Moving Defendants' use of the title card is nominative fair use
The Joint Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims based on the Joint Moving
[623 F.Supp.3d 123]

Defendants’ use of the title card in the 2013 Documentary are barred by the nominative fair use doctrine because the title
card appeared for only several seconds and was ""necessary to identify the video that Pug 'used to watch’ that fueled his
desire to be a member of the 12 O'Clock Boyz."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 38.)

A trademark may be used by a non-owner to identify a product or service, so long as that use is not confusing. See Tiffany
(NJ) Inc. v. eBay Inc., 600 F.3d 93 , 102-03 (2d Cir. 2010) (""[A] defendant may lawfully use a plaintiff's trademark where
doing so is necessary to describe the plaintiff's product and does not imply a false affiliation or endorsement by the plaintiff
of the defendant.""). ""When considering a likelihood of confusion in nominative fair use cases, in addition to discussing each
of the Polaroid factors"" discussed above, courts must consider:

(1) whether the use of the plaintiff's mark is necessary to describe both the plaintiff's product or service and the
defendant's product or service, that is, whether the product or service is not readily identifiable without use of the
mark; (2) whether the defendant uses only so much of the plaintiff's mark as is necessary to identify the product
or service; and (3) whether the defendant did anything that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest
sponsorship or endorsement by the plaintiff holder.

Int'l Info. Sys. Sec. Certification Consortium, Inc. v. Sec. Univ., LLC, 823 F.3d 153 , 168 (2d Cir. 2016). ""When assessing the
second nominative fair use factor, courts are to consider whether the alleged infringer 'step[ped] over the line into a
likelihood of confusion by using the senior user's mark too prominently or too often, in terms of size, emphasis, or repetition.
Id. (alteration in original) (quoting 4 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 23:11 (4th ed.)). ""[W]hen considering
the third nominative fair use factor, courts must not ... consider only source confusion, but rather must consider confusion
regarding affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement by the mark holder."" /d. at 169.

The Joint Moving Defendants display the title card of the 2001 Documentary, which contains Plaintiffs’ ""12 O'Clock Boyz""
mark, at the beginning of the excerpts from the 2001 Documentary. They use the card to identify the film that Pug is
watching, and they accompany that segment of the video with Pug's narration that he used to watch the film with Tibba.


--- Page 29 ---
Nothing about the Joint Moving Defendants’ use implies that Plaintiffs or other 12 O'Clock Boyz members endorse the 2013
Documentary, and, considered in the context of the 2013 Documentary having its own title and credits in a distinct font, the
use does not confuse viewers as to the origin of the 2013 Documentary.

The three nominative fair use factors, taken together with the above analysis of the Polaroid factors, favor the Joint Moving
Defendants. On balance, the Joint Moving Defendants’ use of the 12 O'Clock Boyz mark in reproducing the title card in the
2001 Documentary is unlikely to cause confusion, and Plaintiffs' trademark infringement, false designation, and unfair
competition claims concerning the title card fail under the nominative fair use doctrine.

B. Trademark dilution claim

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that ""Plaintiffs have not alleged that [their] 12 O'Clock Boyz mark is 'famous,"" and any
notoriety their mark may have ""is limited to a niche market of the ‘urban dirt-bike community’, limited to the geographic
region of the ‘Northeast’, in particular [the] 'Maryland, Washington DC, and Virginia

[623 F.Supp.3d 124]
metropolitan area."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 45 (quoting Am. Compl. {ff 1, 36, 45).)

""Under federal law, an owner of a famous, distinctive mark is entitled to an injunction against the user of a mark that is likely
to cause dilution of the famous mark."" E.A. Sween Co. v. A & M Deli Express Inc., 787 F. App'x 780, 786 (2d Cir. 2019)
(quoting Starbucks Corp.,_588 F.3d at 105 ); see also 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c). ""[T]o state a [dilution] claim under [15 U.S.C. §
1125(c)], the plaintiff must plead that it owns the mark, that the mark is famous and distinctive, and that [the] defendant's
actions dilute that mark."" Dua! Groupe, LLC v. Gans-Mex LLC, 932 F. Supp. 2d 569 , 573 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citing Starbucks
Corp., 588 F.3d at 105 ). ""A mark is famous 'if it is widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States
as a designation of source of the goods or services of the mark's owner."" A.V.E.L.A., Inc. v. Estate of Marilyn Monroe, LLC,
131 F. Supp. 3d 196, 215 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)(A)). Courts have recognized that ""the inclusion ...
of the phrase ‘widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States' 'was intended to reject dilution claims
based on niche fame, i.e. fame limited to a particular channel of trade, segment of industry or service, or geographic
region."" Luv N' Care Ltd. v. Regent Baby Prods. Corp.. 841 F. Supp. 2d 753 , 757-58 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Dan-Foam
A/S v. Brand Named Beds, LLC,500 F. Supp. 2d 296 , 307 n.90 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)). Indeed, ""[c]ourts generally have limited
famous marks to those that receive multi-million dollar advertising budgets, generate hundreds of millions of dollars in sales
annually, and are almost universally recognized by the general public."" Helios Int'l S.A.R.L. v. Cantamessa USA, Inc., No.
12-CV-8205, 2013 WL 3943267, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2013) (alteration omitted) (quoting Heller Inc. v. Design Within
Reach, No. 09-CV-1909, 2009 WL 2486054, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2009)). In assessing fame, courts may consider all
relevant factors, including:

(i) The duration, extent, and geographic reach of advertising and publicity of the mark, whether advertised or
publicized by the owner or third parties.

(ii) The amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of goods or services offered under the mark.
(iii) The extent of actual recognition of the mark.

(iv) Whether the mark was registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the
principal register.

A.V.E.L.A., Inc., 131 F. Supp. 3d at 216 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv)). A mark can be distinctive either
""inherently or through acquired distinctiveness."" 15 U.S.C. 1125(c)(1); Dan-Foam A/S, 500 F. Supp. 2d at 306 n.87 (noting
that changes to federal dilution law under the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 include a provision that ""non-
inherently distinctive marks may qualify for protection""). As the Second Circuit has noted, ""the requirement that the mark [at
issue] be 'famous' and ‘distinctive’ significantly limits the pool of marks that may receive dilution protection."" Starbucks Corp.,
588 F.3d at 105 (citations omitted).

Plaintiffs' trademark dilution claim fails because Plaintiffs have not alleged or provided evidence that the 12 O'Clock Boyz
mark is famous outside the niche community of dirt-bike riders or the limited geographic region of the city of Baltimore. See
Helios Int'l S.A.R.L., 2013 WL 3943267, at *10 (holding claim ""that the marks 'have an extremely high degree of recognition
among consumers of luxury jewelry ' ... is the very definition of the type of 'niche' fame that is insufficient to

[623 F.Supp.3d 125]

support a finding of fame for [trademark dilution] purposes""); Malletier v. Dooney & Bourke, Inc.,561 F. Supp. 2d 368 , 380
(S.D.N.Y. 2008) (holding ""fame limited to a particular channel of trade, segment of industry or service, or geographic region
is not sufficient to meet"" the standard of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1996). Although Plaintiffs allege that the
2001 Documentary sold fifty thousand copies, (Am. Compl. 47), those sales numbers fall well short of sales for marks that
have been considered famous for trademark dilution purposes. See Heller Inc., 2009 WL 2486054, at *3 (collecting cases
and explaining that trademark dilution law is intended to protect ""almost universally recognized"" marks such as Hot Wheels,
Budweiser, and Kodak). Accordingly, the Court grants the Joint Moving Defendants summary judgment on Plaintiffs’


--- Page 30 ---
trademark dilution claim.
C. Cybersquatting claim
The Joint Moving Defendants do not address the merits of Plaintiff's claim.

Plaintiffs assert that the Joint Moving Defendants violated the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act by registering the
domain 12oclockboys.com. (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 3.)

""To successfully assert a claim under [15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)], a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) its marks were distinctive at
the time the domain name was registered; (2) the infringing domain names complained of are identical to or confusingly
similar to plaintiff's mark; and (3) the infringer has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark."" Webadviso v. Bank of Am.
Corp., 448 F. App'x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2011); Sporty's Farm L.L.C. v. Sportsman's Mkt., Inc., 202 F.3d 489 , 496-99 (2d Cir.
2000).

The Joint Moving Defendants registered their domain name on January 9, 2013, prior to Plaintiffs’ registration of their mark.
Therefore, Plaintiffs' mark is not presumed to be distinctive. See Lois Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc.,_799 F.2d at 871 (""
[R]egistered trademarks are presumed to be distinctive ....""). However, ""the general principles qualifying a mark for
registration ... are for the most part applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under §
43(a) [of the Lanham Act]."" Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763 , 768,112 S.Ct. 2753 , 120 L.Ed.2d 615
(1992) ; Lyons P'ship, L.P. v. D & L Amusement & Ent., Inc., 702 F. Supp. 2d 104 , 113 (E.D.N.Y. 2010). ""An identifying
mark is distinctive and capable of being protected if it either (1) is inherently distinctive or (2) has acquired distinctiveness
through secondary meaning."" Two Pesos, Inc.,_505 U.S. at 769 , 112 S.Ct. 2753 . ""Inherent distinctiveness is assessed on a
continuum from least to most distinctive, with the aid of categories usually called (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive,
and (4) arbitrary or fanciful, with marks in the last category considered the strongest.""_Car-Freshner Corp. v. Am. Covers.
LLC, 980 F.3d 314 , 329 (2d Cir. 2020); see also Two Pesos, Inc.,505 U.S. at 768 , 112 S.Ct. 2753 (citing Abercrombie &
Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4 , 9 (2d Cir. 1976)) (same). The Second Circuit has explained that:

A mark is generic if it is a common description of products and refers to the genus of which the particular product
is a species. A mark is descriptive if it describes the product's features, qualities, or ingredients in ordinary
language or describes the use to which the product is put. A mark is suggestive if it merely suggests the features
of the product, requiring the purchaser to use imagination, thought, and perception to

[623 F.Supp.3d 126]

reach a conclusion as to the nature of the goods. An arbitrary mark applies a common word in an unfamiliar way.
A fanciful mark is not a real word at all, but is invented for its use as a mark.

Lane Cap. Mgmt., 192 F.3d at 344 . ""Generic marks are not protectable."" /d. Descriptive marks ""are not inherently
distinctive"" and thus are only protected upon a showing that the mark has acquired ""secondary meaning,"" id., which is
""determined by analyzing six factors: advertising expenditures, consumer studies linking the mark to a source, unsolicited
media coverage of the product, sales success, attempts to plagiarize the mark, and the length and exclusivity of the mark's
use,"" Car-Freshner Corp., 980 F.3d at 329 (citing Centaur Commc'ns, Ltd. v. A/S/M Commc'ns, Inc., 830 F.2d 1217 , 1222
(2d Cir. 1987)). Suggestive, arbitrary, and fanciful marks are inherently distinctive and thus automatically protected because
""[t]heir intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular source of a product."" Lane Cap. Mgmt., 192 F.3d at 344 .

As the Joint Moving Defendants argue and Plaintiffs’ allegations and exhibits demonstrate, Plaintiffs' mark is descriptive of
""the way in which riders would elevate the front of their bikes and ride only on the back wheels until their bikes would be
perpendicular to the road or in the '12 O'Clock’ position."" (Oct. 20, 2014 Letter; Trademark Registration; Am. Compl. 4 40
(The title of the film is a phrase coined by Taje to describe the way in which riders would elevate the front of their bikes and
ride only on the back wheels until their bikes would be perpendicular to the road or in the '12 O'Clock’ position.""); see also
Defs.' Joint Mem. 39-40.) Although the Amended Complaint contains several allegations that the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boyz""
has ""acquired secondary meaning,"" (Am. Compl. §§ 50, 229), these allegations are conclusory, and Plaintiffs have not
shown evidence of acquired distinctiveness by January of 2013 beyond the fact of their use of the mark since 2001 and the
existence of a 2003 article in a Baltimore newspaper describing the 12 O'Clock Boys and noting their documentaries. (Hill,
supra.) Accordingly, the Court grants the Joint Moving Defendants summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ cybersquatting claim.

3. Contributory and vicarious trademark infringement under the Lanham Act

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that because ""Plaintiffs' direct federal trademark infringement claim is time-barred,"" and
therefore no underlying claim of direct trademark infringement has been established, ""Plaintiffs' related claims for
contributory and vicarious trademark infringement are also barred."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 54 (first citing Rosetta Stone Ltd. v.
Google, Inc., 676 F.3d 144 , 163 (4th Cir. 2012); and then citingMDT Corp. v. N.Y. Stock Exch., Inc., 858 F. Supp. 1028 ,
1034 (C.D. Ca. 1994))); see also Rosetta Stone Ltd., 676 F.3d at 163 (""[Flor there to be liability for contributory trademark
infringement, the plaintiff must establish underlying direct infringement."" (citing Ga. Pac. Consumer Prods., LP v. Von Drehle
Corp.. 618 F.3d 441 , 451 (4th Cir. 2010))).



--- Page 31 ---
""To be liable for contributory trademark infringement, a defendant must have (1) ‘intentionally induced' the primary infringer
to infringe, or (2) continued to supply an infringing product to an infringer with knowledge that the infringer is mislabeling the
particular product supplied."" _Kelly-Brown v. Winfrey, 717 F.3d 295 , 314 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Perfect 10, Inc. v. Visa Int'l
Serv. Ass'n, 494 F.3d 788 , 807 (9th Cir. 2007)). ""Vicarious liability for trademark infringement requires a finding that the
defendant and the infringer have an apparent or actual partnership, have

[623 F.Supp.3d 127]

authority to bind one another in transactions with third parties or exercise joint ownership or control over the infringing
product."" /d. (quoting Perfect 10, Inc., 494 F.3d at 807 ). ""Vicarious and contributory liability [for trademark infringement]
must be predicated on some direct infringement by the third party."" 7-800 Contacts, Inc. v. Lens.com, Inc.,_722 F.3d 1229 ,
1249 (10th Cir. 2013) (citing 4 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 25:17); see also Inwood Laby's, Inc. v.
Ives Laby's, Inc., 456 U.S. 844 , 854, 102 S.Ct. 2182 , 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982) (""[I]f a manufacturer or distributor intentionally
induces another to infringe a trademark, or if it continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know

result of the deceit.""); Ga. Pac. Consumer Prods., LP, 618 F.3d at 451 (""[A defendant] cannot be liable for contributory
infringement without corresponding direct trademark infringement."" (citing Inwood Laby's, Inc., 456 U.S. at 853-54 , 102
S.Ct. 2182 )); Tiffany (NJ) Inc., 600 F.3d at 103 (describing ""contributory trademark infringement"" as ""culpably facilitating the
infringing conduct"" of another).

Plaintiffs' claims of contributory and vicarious trademark infringement fail because Plaintiffs have not established direct
trademark infringement. See, e.g., Dish Network L.L.C. v. Siddiqi, No. 18-CV-4397, 2019 WL 5781945, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov.
6, 2019) (""As a preliminary matter,... the [court first must find a direct infringing use of the ... marks before it may consider
whether [the] defendant is liable under either [a contributory or vicarious] theory of secondary liability.""); Carrell v. Origami

""[b]oth contributory trademark infringement and vicarious trademark infringement are predicated upon the existence of a
direct infringement"" and dismissing these claims because the plaintiffs ""have not adequately alleged that any [dJefendant
committed direct trademark infringement""), aff in part and vacated in part, 717 F.3d 295 (2d Cir. 2013) (vacating finding of
no direct infringement and affirming dismissal of contributory and vicarious infringement claims on other grounds).

Accordingly, the Court grants the Joint Moving Defendants summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ contributory and vicarious
trademark infringement claims under the Lanham Act. 22

[623 F.Supp.3d 128]
iv. The Court denies Plaintiffs' application for declaratory judgments

Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgments invalidating the Nathan Defendants’ copyrights in the 2013 Documentary and 2008
DVDs. (Am. Compl. 9 271-288.)

The Nathan Defendants argue that (1) Plaintiffs seek an improper advisory opinion in seeking to invalidate the Nathan
Defendants’ copyright registrations in the 2013 Documentary and the 2008 DVDs because the validity of these copyright
registrations is not relevant to Plaintiffs' claims for relief on the merits, (Defs.' Joint Mem. 45-48); (2) even if the declaratory
relief sought was relevant to Plaintiffs’ affirmative claims, the Court should dismiss these causes of action ""because they
would be redundant of Plaintiffs’ affirmative claims,"" ( id. at 48 n.58); and (3) these claims are time-barred, ( id. at 56-58).

The Declaratory Judgment Act provides, in pertinent part, that ""[i]In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction... any
court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any
interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought."" 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a);

Declaratory Judgment Act, ""actual controversy"" means ""whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that
there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to
warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment."" Medimmune, Inc.,549 U.S. at 127 , 127 S.Ct. 764 (quoting Md. Cas. Co. v.

Federal courts have ""unique and substantial discretion in deciding whether to declare the rights of litigants"" under the
Declaratory Judgment Act. Medimmune, Inc., 549 U.S. at 136 , 127 S.Ct. 764 (quoting_Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S.

consistently interpreted

[623 F.Supp.3d 129]

[the Declaratory Judgment Act's] permissive language as a broad grant of discretion to district courts to refuse to exercise
jurisdiction over a declaratory action that they would otherwise be empowered to hear.""). The Second Circuit instructs
district courts to consider certain prudential factors in determining whether to exercise their discretion to consider a
declaratory judgment action, including:

[1] whether the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying or settling the legal issues involved; ... [2]
whether a judgment would finalize the controversy and offer relief from uncertainty[;]... [3] whether the proposed
remedy is being used merely for procedural fencing or a race to res judicata; [4] whether the use of a declaratory
judgment would increase friction between sovereign legal systems or improperly encroach on the domain of a
state or foreign court; and [5] whether there is a better or more effective remedy.

New York v. Solvent Chem. Co., 664 F.3d 22 , 26 (2d Cir. 2011) (alterations in original) (quotingDow Jones & Co., Inc.,_346
F.3d at 359-60 ).

A declaratory judgment would not settle the legal issues disputed in this case because the validity of the Nathan Defendants’
copyrights has no bearing on whether Plaintiffs' copyrights (or their other rights) were violated. Therefore, it would not have
practical implications for the dispute between the parties. See Mitskovski v. Buffalo & Fort Erie Pub. Bridge Auth., 415 F.
App'x 264, 267 (2d Cir. 2011).

Accordingly, the Court declines to issue declaratory judgments as to the validity of the Nathan Defendants' copyrights. 28
v. Dismissal under Rule 19 is inappropriate

The Joint Moving Defendants argue that the Court must dismiss Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to Rule 19 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure because Plaintiffs have failed to join indispensable parties — namely, Danielle Avent, who co-owns the
copyright in the 2001 Documentary, and the 12 O'Clock Boyz, Inc., which is the copyright proprietor of the film — and ""[if
they are not joined,"" Defendants ""face the possibility of duplicative litigations and inconsistent judgments."" (Defs.' Joint Mem.
59-60.) The Joint Moving Defendants further argue that by failing to respond to this argument, Plaintiffs ""have abandoned
the right to contest it."" (Defs.' Joint Reply 11.) In addition, the Joint Moving Defendants argue that Deafueh Monbo, who,
contrary to Plaintiffs’ allegations, is not listed on the copyright registrations for the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries, ""does not
have standing to assert copyright claims in this lawsuit."" (Defs.' Joint Mem. 59, 60 n.70; Defs.' Joint Reply 10.)

Plaintiffs argue that, as a co-owner of the copyrights in the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries, Taje Monbo has ""independent
standing to sue and need [not] join ... Danielle Avent."" (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 7.) Plaintiffs do not respond to the
Joint Moving Defendants' other arguments.

Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ""recognizes exceptional circumstances in which the plaintiff's choice of
parties or forum must give way because of an absent party's interest in the outcome of the action or involvement in the

underlying dispute."" Marvel Characters,
[623 F.Supp.3d 130]

Inc. v. Kirby. 726 F.3d 119 , 131 (2d Cir. 2013). Rule 19(a)(1) specifies the circumstances under which a party is necessary
to an action:

A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter
jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:

(A) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or

(B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the
action in the person's absence may

(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or

If a party is necessary but unable to be joined, a court must ""determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action

feasible"" (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b))). In making this decision, a court should consider: ""(1) whether a judgment rendered in
a person's absence might prejudice that person or parties to the action, (2) the extent to which any prejudice could be
alleviated, (3) whether a judgment in the person's absence would be adequate, and (4) whether the plaintiff would have

As the Joint Moving Defendants argue, Deafueh Monbo lacks standing to sue on Plaintiffs' copyright infringement claims
because she is not an owner of the copyrights in the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries, as Plaintiffs allege. ( Compare Am.
Compl. {4 1, 19 (alleging that Plaintiffs own the copyrights); with Copyright Registrations, annexed to Am. Compl. as Ex. 1,
Docket Entry No. 98-3, at 2-3 (listing Taje Monbo and Avent as claimants of copyright in 2001 Documentary and Taje
Monbo as claimant of copyright in 2003 Documentary)); see a/so Urbont v. Sony Music Ent., 831 F.3d 80 , 87 n.6 (2d Cir.
2016) (collecting cases and noting that the ""plaintiffs must prove ownership not only as an element of a copyright
infringement claim, but also to assert their standing to bring suit"").

Plaintiffs concede that Danielle Avent is a co-owner of the copyright in the 2001 Documentary. 22As Plaintiffs argue,
however, Taje Monbo, as the joint owner of the copyright, is not required to join Avent. See Davis v. Blige, 505 F.3d 90 , 99
(2d Cir. 2007) (""The right to prosecute an accrued cause of action for [copyright] infringement is ... a right that may be
exercised independently of co-owners; a joint owner is not required to join his other co-owners in an action for
infringement.""); see also 17 U.S.C. § 501(b) (noting that a court ""may require"" a copyright owner to serve notice on a person
who is shown ""to have or claim an interest in the copyright"" and ""may require the joinder... of any person having or claiming
an interest in the copyright""). As to 12 O'Clock Boyz, Inc., the Court finds that it is not a necessary party because that
corporation has been dissolved. 2° Maryland law provides that ""[o]nce a corporation's existence has been terminated, the
defunct corporation can neither sue, nor be sued."" Scott v. Seek Lane Venture, Inc., 91 Md. App. 668 , 686, 605 A.2d 942

In addition, although the Joint Moving Defendants argue that failure to join
[623 F.Supp.3d 132]

Avent and 12 O'Clock Boyz, Inc. will expose them to ""the possibility of duplicative litigations and inconsistent judgments,""
(Defs.' Joint Mem. 60; Defs.' Joint Reply 10-11) — a factor to be considered in determining whether a party is necessary
under Rule 19(a)(1)(B) — neither party is a necessary party under this rule because they have not ""claim[ed] an interest
relating to the subject of the action."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(B). Instead, the Joint Moving Defendants seek to assert an
interest on their behalf, which is insufficient to satisfy Rule 19(a)(1)(B)'s requirements. See Washington Nat'l Ins. Co., 958
F.3d at 135 (concluding that an absent party was not necessary ""under Rule 19(a)(1)(B) because it fail[ed] to satisfy a
threshold requirement"" of claiming an interest); Peregrine Myan. Ltd. v. Segal, 89 F.3d 41 , 49 (2d Cir. 1996) (""[The

Moving Defendants fulfilled their obligation to explain why they have not attempted to join Avent or 12 O'Clock Boyz, Inc., or
explained why dismissal, rather than some other remedy, is appropriate.

Accordingly, the Court denies the Joint Moving Defendants’ motion to dismiss the action based on failure to join Avent and
12 O'Clock Boyz, Inc. See Tae H. Kim, 776 F. App'x at 20.

c. The SPE Defendants’ motion to dismiss

The SPE Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims on the grounds that (1) the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over
Overbrook Entertainment, Inc., Overbrook Entertainment, LLC, and Smith; (2) Plaintiffs have failed to state their copyright
and trademark claims; and (3) Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim is preempted by federal law and fails to state a claim. 34

[623 F.Supp.3d 133]

i. The court lacks personal jurisdiction over Overbrook Entertainment, Inc., Overbrook Entertainment, LLC, and
Smith

The SPE Defendants argue that the court lacks general and specific personal jurisdiction over Overbrook Entertainment,
Inc., Overbrook Entertainment, LLC, and Smith. 32 (SPE Defs.' Mem. 17-25.) In addition, the SPE Defendants argue that
Plaintiffs do not refute the SPE Defendants’ jurisdictional facts. (SPE Defs.' Reply 1.)

Plaintiffs allege that the Court has specific jurisdiction over Overbrook Entertainment, Inc., Overbrook Entertainment, LLC,

and Smith and also appear to allege that the Court has general jurisdiction over these Defendants. ( SeeAm. Compl. ¥ 17;
Pls.' Opp'n to SPE Defs.' Mot. 17-18.)

""There are two types of personal jurisdiction: specific and general."" Sonera Holding B.V. v. Gukurova Holding A.S.,750 F.3d
221 , 225 (2d Cir. 2014) (per curiam). General jurisdiction permits a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant
regardless of whether the underlying claim has a connection to the forum. /d. (""A court with general jurisdiction over a
corporation may adjudicate ai/ claims against that corporation — even those entirely unrelated to the defendant's contacts
with the state.""). Specific jurisdiction requires a connection between the forum exercising jurisdiction over the defendant and
the underlying controversy that gave rise to the claim. Waldman v. Palestine Liberation Org., 835 F.3d 317 , 331 (2d Cir.
2016) (""Specific jurisdiction ... depends on an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally,
activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum state and is therefore subject to the State's regulation."" (quoting
Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915 , 919, 131 S.Ct. 2846 , 180 L.Ed.2d 796 (2011) )). Under
New York law, courts exercise specific jurisdiction pursuant to New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (""N.Y. C.P.L.R."") §
302 and general jurisdiction pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 301.

1. Specific jurisdiction

The SPE Defendants argue that the Court lacks specific jurisdiction over Overbrook Entertainment, Inc., Overbrook
Entertainment, LLC, and Smith because the Feature Film does not have ties to New York sufficient to support specific
personal jurisdiction. (SPE Defs.' Mem. 17-25.)

Plaintiffs allege that the Court has specific jurisdiction over the SPE Defendants because they purposefully availed
hemselves of the privilege of conducting business in New York by marketing and promoting the Feature Film on IMDB and
hrough ""other means"" to New York consumers, (Am. Compl. § 17), and because they ""bought the movie rights"" to make the
Feature Film from New York residents, ""entered into agreements and contracts"" with riders from New York who appear in the
Feature Film, and have produced, advertised, and marketed other films and music to consumers in New York, ( see Pls.’
Opp'n to SPE Defs.' Mot. 17-18).

Under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302(a), the New York long-arm statute, there are four bases for extending specific personal
jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary defendant.

623 F.Supp.3d 134]

Bah v. Apple Inc., No. 19-CV-3539, 2020 WL 614932, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 10, 2020); see also Best Van Lines. Inc. v.
Walker, 490 F.3d 239 , 244 (2d Cir. 2007) (describing bases for jurisdiction under the New York long-arm statute). Section
302(a)(1) permits courts to ""exercise personal jurisdiction over [a] non-domiciliary"" where the ""cause of action aris[es] from
any of the acts enumerated in th[e] [statute]"" and the defendant ""transacts any business within the state or contracts
anywhere to supply goods or services in the state."" N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302(a)(1); see also Kurzon LLP v. Thomas M. Cooley L.

exercise specific personal jurisdiction over non-domiciliary defendant pursuant to section 302(a)(1)). In addition, even if a



--- Page 35 ---
plaintiff can establish jurisdiction under New York law, the court must also determine whether the ""exercise of personal
jurisdiction over a foreign defendant comports with due process protections established under the United States

Constitution."" Licci IV,_732 F.3d at 168 (first citing Best Van Lines, Inc., 490 F.3d at 242 ; and then citing /nt'l Shoe Co. v.

""In order to evaluate whether personal jurisdiction exists pursuant to [N.Y.] C.P.L.R. § 302(a)(1), [the court] must determine:

substantial relationship, between the [conduct] and the actions that occurred in New York."" Penachio v. Benedict, 461 F.

450 F.3d 100 , 103 (2d Cir. 2006))). Under New York state law, a defendant's lack of physical presence in the state is not
dispositive of whether he transacts business within the state, ""so long as the defendant's activities [within the state] were
purposeful and there is a substantial relationship between the transaction and the claim asserted."" Fischbarg v. Doucet, 9

[623 F.Supp.3d 135]

In determining whether a defendant is purposefully transacting business in New York, a court must look at ""the quality of the
defendant['s] New York contacts."" Fischbarg, 9 N.Y.3d at 380 , 849 N.Y.S.2d 501 , 880 N.E.2d 22 ; see Best Van Lines, Inc.,
490 F.3d at 246 (""Courts look to 'the totality of the defendant's activities within the forum' to determine whether a defendant
has 'transact[ed] business’ in such a way that it constitutes ‘purposeful activity’ satisfying the first part of the test."" (alteration
in original) (citation omitted) (first quoting Sterling Nat'l Bank & Tr. Co. of N.Y. v. Fidelity Mortg. Invs., 510 F.2d 870 , 873 (2d
Cir. 1975); and then citing Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. v. Barnes & Reinecke, Inc., 15 N.Y.2d 443 , 457,261 N.Y.S.2d 8,
209 N.E.2d 68 (1965) )); see also Licci II, 673 F.3d at 62 (noting that a single act or ""an ongoing course of conduct or
relationship in the state may"" suffice to establish jurisdiction). ""[MJore limited contacts regarding services to be performed
outside New York would not satisfy [section] 302(a)(1)."" Yih, 815 F. App'x at 574 (citing Fischbarg, 9 N.Y.3d at 380 , 849
N.Y.S.2d 501 , 880 N.E.2d 22 ).

To satisfy the ""arising from"" prong, a plaintiff must show that there is a ""substantial relationship"" or ""articulable nexus""
between the claim asserted and the actions taken in New York. Best Van Lines, Inc., 490 F.3d at 246 ; see also Licci ex rel.
Licci v. Lebanese Can. Bank, SAL (Licci III), 20 N.Y.3d 327 , 341,960 N.Y.S.2d 695 , 984 N.E.2d 893 (2012) (""[W]here at
least one element [of the cause of action pleaded] arises from the New York contacts, the relationship between the business
transaction and the claim asserted supports specific jurisdiction under [section 302(a)(1)]."").

Plaintiffs’ allegations are insufficient to support the exercise of specific jurisdiction. Although Plaintiffs allege that the SPE
Defendants promoted their film on IMDB, passively making information available to viewers on the internet does not
constitute ""transacting business"" in the forum state. See, e.g., Yih, 815 F. App'x at 573 (""[P]assive websites, ‘which merely
impart information without permitting a business transaction, are generally insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.”
(quoting_Paterno v. Laser Spine Inst., 24 N.Y.3d 370 , 377,998 N.Y.S.2d 720 , 23 N.E.3d 988 (2014) )); Best Van Lines,

N.Y.S.2d 720 , 23 N.E.3d 988 (2014) .

In addition, although Plaintiffs assert in their opposition that the SPE Defendants ""bought the movie rights"" from New York
residents, they do not allege any facts that would support a conclusion that the SPE Defendants transacted business in New
York in buying the rights. For example, they do not allege that the SPE Defendants

[623 F.Supp.3d 136]


--- Page 36 ---
initiated the negotiations, negotiated, or executed a contract for the movie rights in New York, and the SPE Defendants’
declarations indicate they did not travel to New York in connection with the film. ( See Decl. of Will Smith in Supp. of SPE
Defs.' Mot. 7, Docket Entry No. 150; Decl. of Overbrook Ent., Inc. in Supp. of SPE Defs.' Mot. 45, Docket Entry No. 151);
Lear v. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., No. 20-CV-4660, 2021 WL 1299489, at *6-9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2021) (finding no
jurisdiction where company ""hired a New York resident for employment outside of the State,"" contractual relationship was
brief, ""employment contract was negotiated and executed solely via telephone and email"" and ""no representative of [the
company] traveled to New York,"" and there was ""no evidence of any payment made to a New York bank"" or of a ""New York
choice of law""). Finally, although Plaintiffs argue that the SPE Defendants have marketed other films and music in New York,
Plaintiffs' claims do not arise from this alleged conduct, either. See, e.g., Licci IV, 732 F.3d at 168 (noting that the cause of
action must ""arise from"" the business transacted).

2. General jurisdiction

The SPE Defendants argue that the Court lacks general jurisdiction over Overbrook Entertainment, Inc., Overbrook
Entertainment, LLC, and Smith because they lack the requisite contacts with the forum that would support the assertion of
general jurisdiction. (SPE Defs.' Mem. 17-25; SPE Defs.' Reply 1.)

Based on Plaintiffs’ allegations of the SPE Defendants’ contacts with New York, including marketing and promoting the
Feature Film to New York consumers, (Am. Compl. § 17), buying the movie rights to make the Feature Film from New York
residents, entering into agreements and contracts with riders from New York, and producing, advertising, and marketing
other films and music to consumers in New York, ( see Pls.' Opp'n to SPE Defs.' Mot. 17-18), the Court understands
Plaintiffs to also be asserting general jurisdiction over the SPE Defendants pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 301.

""For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual's domicile; for a corporation, it
is an equivalent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home.""_SPV Osus, Ltd. v. UBS AG, 882 F.3d 333
, 343 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Goodyear Dunlop, 564 U.S. at 923 , 131 S.Ct. 2846 ). To establish general jurisdiction over a
foreign corporation, a plaintiff must set forth facts showing that the ""corporation's affiliations with the State are so continuous
and systematic as to render it essentially at home in the forum.""_Chufen Chen v. Dunkin' Brands, Inc., 954 F.3d 492 , 498

jurisdiction only in its place of incorporation or principal place of business."" (quoting SPV Osus Ltd., 882 F.3d at 343 )).

Overbrook Entertainment, Inc., Overbrook Entertainment, LLC, and Smith are not domiciled or incorporated in New York,
New York is not their principal place of business, and there are no other allegations of extensive ties to support the exercise
of general jurisdiction. See Daimler AG, 571 U.S. at 136-39 , 134 S.Ct. 746 (explaining that general jurisdiction may be
exercised over a business where it is ""at home,"" generally meaning ""where it is incorporated or has its principal place of

jurisdiction); Brown, 814 F.3d at 629 (finding no general jurisdiction over firm with permanent physical presence in state,

case"" (citing Daimler AG,_571 U.S. at 140 n.20, 134 S.Ct. 746 )); Sonera Holding B.V.,_750 F.3d at 226 (holding that
negotiations, transactions, and an office in New York did not support exercise of general jurisdiction).

Because the Court lacks both specific and general jurisdiction over Overbrook Entertainment, Inc., Overbrook
Entertainment, LLC, and Smith, the Court grants the SPE Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction over
these Defendants and dismisses the claims against them without prejudice. Even assuming the Court had personal
jurisdiction over Overbrook Entertainment, Inc., Overbrook Entertainment, LLC, and Smith, Plaintiffs' claims against these
Defendants nevertheless fail for the reasons discussed below with respect to Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc.

ii. The Feature Film does not infringe Plaintiffs' copyrights

The SPE Defendants argue that Plaintiffs allege only three similarities between their documentaries and the Feature Film
with any degree of specificity, and that these similarities do not constitute copyright infringement. (SPE Defs.' Mem. 3-6.) In
support, the SPE Defendants argue that the similarities — (1) ""young riders who want to join a motorcycle club,"" (2) the ""use
of skilled motorcycle stunt riders,"" and (3) ""a setting in Baltimore"" — are scénes a faire in any film about motorcyclists that



--- Page 37 ---
are neither unique nor original, nor subject to any copyright protection. ( /d. at 3.) The SPE Defendants also argue that (1) ""
[u]nder copyright law, no one can own the general concept of a film about a kid who aspires to join a Baltimore urban dirt
bike club,"" (SPE Defs.' Reply 1); (2) the combination of unprotectable elements is not entitled to protection because their
arrangement is not unique, ( id. at 4-5); (3) Plaintiffs have not shown any real similarities, and therefore their argument that
they needed to show only representative infringement fails, ( id. at 3-4); and (4) they are not responsible for vicarious
infringement because they did not supervise or control the 2013 Documentary, ( id. at 5).

Plaintiffs argue that they have sufficiently alleged representative acts of infringement and that the SPE Defendants have
profited from their infringement.

[623 F.Supp.3d 138]

(Pls.' Opp'n to SPE Defs.' Mot. 8-10.) In addition, Plaintiffs argue that non-protected elements are protected when viewed as
a whole. ( /d. at 10-11, 209 N.E.2d 68 .)

As discussed above in addressing the Joint Moving Defendants’ motion, to the extent the plot of Plaintiffs' works can be
understood as one of inspiring young riders to join the 12 O'Clock Boyz, this is a general plot idea that is not protectable
beyond the manner in which it is expressed, and, in any event, the Feature Film's concept of a young boy who wants to join
a dirt-bike group does not appear in Plaintiffs' works — it only appears in the 2013 Documentary, which the SPE Defendants
licensed from the Nathan Defendants. See supra Section II.b.i.2.A.4. In addition, the dirt-bike riders in the 2001 and 2003
Documentaries are stock characters and thus are not protectable elements of Plaintiffs' works, as the concept of skilled
riders who perform daring stunts flows from the theme of a work about dirt-bike riding. See supra Section II.b.i.2.A.2. Lastly,
the setting of Plaintiffs’ works in Baltimore is unprotectable both because it is a scéne a faire that necessarily flows from the
fact that the works are about the 12 O'Clock Boyz, to whom the Feature Film gives the fictional name the ""Midnight Clique,""
and because it is a fact in the public domain that the 12 O'Clock Boyz are from Baltimore and ride there. See supra Section
Il.b.i.2.A.1; Walker, 784 F.2d at 50 (holding that a police story about police officers from the 41st Precinct that takes place in
the South Bronx, where the 41st Precinct is located, ""cannot be copyrightable"" because these ""are real places known to the
public""). Moreover, because neither the 2013 Documentary nor the Feature Film infringes on Plaintiffs’ copyrights, the SPE
Defendants are not liable for vicarious or contributory infringement. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545
U.S. 913 , 914,125 S.Ct. 2764 , 162 L.Ed.2d 781 (2005) (""One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or
encouraging direct infringement, and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise the
right to stop or limit it."").

Accordingly, the Court grants the SPE Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ copyright infringement claims as to Sony
Pictures Entertainment, Inc.

iii. Plaintiffs’ trademark infringement claims fail

The SPE Defendants argue that none of the four instances of trademark infringement Plaintiffs allege are a valid basis fora
claim. 33 (SPE Defs.' Mem. 9-11.) In support, they argue that (1) stray references to ""12 O'Clock Boys"" or ""Twelve"" as a
potential title of the film do not give rise to a trademark claim because Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that these
references are likely to cause consumer confusion and they are not explicitly misleading under the Rogers test discussed
above, ( id. at 11-12); (2) such uses of these phrases constitute fair use because the phrases are used descriptively rather
than to identify the SPE Defendants’ products, (SPE Defs.' Reply 6 n.7); (3) casting riders in the ""Midnight Clique"" from
groups other than the 12 O'Clock Boyz does not constitute trademark dilution because they are not making use of the mark
in commerce, (SPE Defs.' Mem. 14); and (4) Plaintiffs have abandoned their trademark claims by failing to respond to the
SPE Defendants’ arguments

[623 F.Supp.3d 139]
in their opposition, (SPE Defs.' Reply 6 n.7).

Plaintiffs bring claims of trademark infringement under section 32(1) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1) based on the
SPE Defendants’ use and continued use of ""reproductions, copies, and colorable imitations of Plaintiffs' registered 12
O'Clock Boyz [m]arks"" in connection with advertising of the Feature Film, (Am. Compl. § 227); trademark infringement, false
designation of origin, and unfair competition under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), based on the SPE
Defendants’ use of the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boys"" as the title of the Feature Film, ( id. 229); trademark dilution under
section 43(c) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c), based on the SPE Defendants ""casting random riders"" as 12 O'Clock
Boys, ( id. § 233); and trademark infringement under Maryland Code Business Regulation § 1-414 et seq., ( id. J 244);
trademark infringement, false advertising, and unfair competition under the Maryland common law, ( id. {| 246-248); and
contributory and vicarious trademark infringement under federal law and the Maryland common law, ( id. ¥ 251). In support
of their claims, Plaintiffs allege that the SPE Defendants (1) created or authorized the creation of a Wikipedia page stating
that the film would be called 12 O'Clock Boys, (2) created or authorized the creation of an IMDB page that listed ""12 O'Clock
Boys"" as a working title in 2018, (3) authorized advertising of their film on Twitter and other social media platforms using
Plaintiffs’ mark, and (4) changed the Wikipedia entry in 2019 to refer to the film as ""Twelve."" ( /d. 44 149-151, 159.) Plaintiffs
do not address the SPE Defendants' arguments but argue instead that their 12 O'Clock Boyz mark has acquired
distinctiveness and is ""well known in the dirt-bike culture."" (Pls.' Opp'n to SPE Defs.' Mot. 15-16.)


--- Page 38 ---
As discussed above, in order to prevail on a trademark infringement claim, a plaintiff ""must demonstrate that (1) 'ithas a
valid mark that is entitled to protection’ and that (2) the defendant's ‘actions are likely to cause confusion with [that] mark""
under the Polaroid factors. Tiffany & Co.,971 F.3d at 84 (alteration in original) (quoting Sports Auth., Inc. v. Prime Hosp.
Corp., 89 F.3d 955 , 960 (2d Cir. 1996)); Really Good Stuff, LLC v. BAP Invs., L.C., 813 F. App'x 39, 43 (2d Cir. 2020)
(same); Guthrie Healthcare Sys., 826 F.3d at 37 (same). In addition, the First Amendment bars claims based on a title under
the Lanham Act and its state-law counterparts ""unless the title has no artistic relevance to the underlying work whatsoever,
or, if it has some artistic relevance, unless the title explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work."" Twin
Peaks Prods., 996 F.2d at 1379 (quoting Rogers, 875 F.2d at 999 ).

The four bases Plaintiffs allege for their trademark claims all relate to internet references to ""Twelve"" and ""12 O'Clock Boys""
as potential titles for the Feature Film, which was ultimately titled ""Charm City Kings."" ( See, e.g., SPE Defs.' Reply 5.) The
SPE Defendants’ use of ""Twelve"" as a potential title cannot serve as the basis for Plaintiffs’ trademark claims, as Plaintiffs do
not allege that they have a valid trademark in the word ""Twelve."" Nor can their use of the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boys"" as a
potential title on Wikipedia, IMDB, or in advertising for the film 24

[623 F.Supp.3d 140]

serve as a basis for their trademark claims, as such claims are barred by the First Amendment under Rogers. The SPE
Defendants' use of the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boys"" as a potential title meets the low threshold for artistic relevance to the
film's content, as the film is an adaptation of the 2013 Documentary. In addition, the title is not explicitly misleading as to the
source or content of the Feature Film under the Polaroid factors. Although ""12 O'Clock Boys"" and ""12 O'Clock Boyz"" are
similar, the SPE Defendants' actions are not likely to cause confusion because: (1) Plaintiffs' mark is not particularly strong;
(2) the parties' products are both films and thus are in proximate areas of commerce, making the likelihood that Plaintiffs will
bridge the gap irrelevant; (3) Plaintiffs do not allege actual consumer confusion; (4) Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged bad
faith, as the SPE Defendants' use of the term is attributable to the fact that the Feature Film is an adaptation of the 2013
Documentary; (5) as a studio feature film, the Feature Film will be a higher quality production than Plaintiffs' documentaries;
and (6) the relevant population of consumers of the Feature Film — filmgoers — are not likely to confuse the source of the
Feature Film and Plaintiffs' documentaries, particularly given that both include explicit source designations. Because there is
not a ""particularly compelling"" likelihood of confusion under the Polaroid factors, the use of the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boys"" as
a potential title is not explicitly misleading as to the source or content of the Feature Film. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ federal and
state law claims for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition are barred by the First
Amendment. 35 See Medina, 2016 WL 3906714, at *12 (granting motion to dismiss federal and state law trademark claims
because ""the work is a film, and ... its title is artistically relevant to its content and not explicitly misleading as to any
association with plaintiff's music duo,"" and ""[g]iven the First Amendment values at interest, the Lanham Act and its state law
counterparts have been and must be construed not to reach such expression"" (first citing Rogers, 875 F.2d at 998 ; and then
citing Yankee Publ'g Inc. v. News Am. Publ'g Inc., 809 F. Supp. 267 , 282 (S.D.N.Y. 1992))); see also Mid S. Bldg. Supply of
Ma., Inc. v. Guardian Door & Window, Inc., 156 Md. App. 445 , 460, 847 A.2d 463 (2004) (""[T]rademark infringement cases
under either the Maryland statute or the Lanham Act are based on the same legal theory and require the same proof."");
Sterling Acceptance Corp. v. Tommark, Inc., 227 F. Supp. 2d 454 , 460, 466 (D. Md. 2002) (""The test for trademark
infringement and unfair competition under state law is the same as the test under the Lanham Act. ... Moreover, the test for
common law trademark infringement and unfair competition under Maryland law is the same as that under the Lanham Act,
namely proof of the likelihood of confusion.""), aff'd, 91 F. App'x 880 (4th Cir. 2004).

Finally, as discussed above, because Plaintiffs fail to state claims of direct trademark infringement, their claims of
contributory and vicarious infringement also fail. See, e.g., Dish Network L.L.C.,

[623 F.Supp.3d 141]

2019 WL 5781945, at *3. In addition, because the 12 O'Clock Boyz mark is not sufficiently famous to be the subject of a

dilution claim, this claim also fails. See Small Bus. Bodyguard, Inc. v. House of Moxie, Inc., No. 14-CV-7170, 2014 WL
5585339, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2014).

Accordingly, the Court grants the SPE Defendants’ motion and dismisses Plaintiffs’ trademark claims against Sony Pictures
Entertainment, Inc. under federal and state law.

iv. Plaintiffs fail to state an unjust enrichment claim

The SPE Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' cause of action for unjust enrichment is preempted by federal law, 28is simply a
repetition of their other claims and must fail because those claims are without merit, and fails to state a claim because
Plaintiffs do not allege that they had a relationship with the SPE Defendants or undertook activities for the SPE Defendants’
benefit. (SPE Defs.' Mem. 14-15.)

Plaintiffs allege that the SPE Defendants unjustly enriched themselves through use of the 12 O'Clock Boyz mark, (Am.
Compl. ¥ 266-270), but do not respond to the SPE Defendants’ arguments.

As discussed above, a choice of law analysis is necessary with respect to Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim, and the interest
analysis test applies because this claim sounds in tort. However, the parties have not briefed the choice of law issue, and it


--- Page 39 ---
is unclear from Plaintiffs’ allegations where the allegedly tortious conduct underlying this claim — the SPE Defendants’
alleged use of Plaintiffs' marks ""to promote and advertise"" the Feature Film — occurred. (Am. Compl. § 266.) However,
Plaintiffs fail to state an unjust enrichment claim under both Maryland and New York law. 22

With respect to Maryland law, Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that the SPE Defendants had an ""appreciation or
knowledge"" of the benefit allegedly conferred on them by their use of the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boys"" in advertising the
Feature Film. Plaintiffs have also failed to plausibly allege that it would be inequitable to allow the SPE Defendants to ""retain
this benefit without the payment of its value,"" as Plaintiffs have failed to

[623 F.Supp.3d 142]

state a claim that the SPE Defendants’ use of the phrase infringed their mark and that their retention of any benefits due to
the use of the phrase ""12 O' Clock Boys"" is therefore ""unjust."" MAS Assocs., LLC, 475 Md. at 380 n.18, 257 A.3d 553
(quoting Hill, 402 Md. at 295 , 936 A.2d 343 ); see also Smoot v. Simmons, No. 05-CV-3106, 2006 WL 1999203, at *7 (D.
Md. July 14, 2006) (""[The] [p]laintiff has failed to allege that [the] [djefendants either appreciated or knew about [the
plaintiff's] designs, or that [the] [dJefendants accepted and retained any benefits associated with those designs.""). With
respect to New York law, as the SPE Defendants argue, Plaintiffs have not alleged a relationship between themselves and
the SPE Defendants. See, e.g., Ga. Malone & Co., 19 N.Y.3d at 517-18 , 950 N.Y.S.2d 333 , 973 N.E.2d 743 (""[T]he
relationship between [the plaintiff] and [the defendant] is too attenuated because they simply had no dealings with each
other.""); Mandarin Trading Ltd., 16 N.Y.3d at 182 , 919 N.Y.S.2d 465 , 944 N.E.2d 1104 (""[U]nder the facts alleged, there are
no indicia of an enrichment that was unjust where the pleadings failed to indicate a relationship between the parties that
could have caused reliance or inducement."").

Accordingly, Plaintiffs fail to state an unjust enrichment claim based on the SPE Defendants’ allegedly infringing use of their
mark.

d. Default judgment motions
Plaintiffs move for default judgment against Mission Film, Inc., and Mission Film Productions.

In her answer to the Amended Complaint, Mochin states that she registered the trade name Mission Film Productions but
does not conduct business under that name. (Mochin Answer, Docket Entry No. 132; see also Mochin Letter dated Dec. 10,
2019, Docket Entry No. 138.) In addition, she states that a trade name is not suable under Maryland law. (Mochin Answer 1.)
Mochin also disclaims involvement in making or distributing the 2013 Documentary and asks that the case be dismissed. (
Id. at 1-2.) Several of the Nathan and Oscilloscope Defendants oppose default judgment on the grounds that Plaintiffs have
not shown they are entitled to default judgment as a matter of law, and ask, in the alternative, that the Court decline to grant
default judgment until the merits of this multi-defendant case have been resolved. ( See Nathan and Oscilloscope Defs.'
Mem. in Opp'n to Pls.’ Default J. Mots.; Nathan and Oscilloscope Defs.' Second Mem. in Opp'n to Pls.' Default J. Mots.)

Pursuant to Rule 55 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there is ""a ‘two-step process' for the entry of judgment against a
party who fails to defend: first, the entry of a default, and second, the entry of a default judgment."" City of New York v.
Mickalis Pawn Shop, LLC, 645 F.3d 114 , 128 (2d Cir. 2011) (citing New York v. Green, 420 F.3d 99 , 104 (2d Cir. 2005)).
""The entry of a default, while establishing liability, 'is not an admission of damages."" /d. at 128 (quoting_Finkel v.
Romanowicz, 577 F.3d 79 , 83 n.6 (2d Cir. 2009)). ""[T]he admission of factual allegations does not amount to an admission
of liability; the court is still 'required to determine whether the [plaintiff's] allegations establish [the defendant's] liability as a
matter of law."" /sigi v. Dorvilier, 795 F. App'x 31, 33-34 (2d Cir. 2019) (second and third alterations in original) (quoting
Finkel, 577 F.3d at 84 ). ""[T]he court may, on plaintiffs’ motion, enter a default judgment if liability is established as a matter
of law when the factual allegations of the complaint are taken as true."" Bricklayers & Allied Craftworkers Loc. 2 v. Moulton
Masonry & Const., LLC,_779 F.3d 182 , 187 (2d Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (citing Mickalis

[623 F.Supp.3d 143]

Pawn Shop, LLC, 645 F.3d at 137 ). ""A default ... only establishes a defendant's liability if those allegations are sufficient to
state a cause of action against the defendant."" Taizhou Zhongneng Imp. & Exp. Co. v. Koutsobinas, 509 F. App'x 54, 56 (2d
Cir. 2013); see also LG Funding, LLC v. Fla. Tilt, Inc., No. 15-CV-631, 2015 WL 4390453, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July 15, 2015)
(""To determine whether the default judgment should issue, the [c]ourt examines whether 'the factual allegations, accepted
as true, provide a proper basis for liability and relief."""" (quoting_Rolls-Royce PLC v. Rolls-Royce USA, Inc., 688 F. Supp. 2d
150 , 153 (E.D.N.Y. 2010))). However, the Second Circuit has an ""oft-stated preference for resolving disputes on the merits,""
Enron Oil Corp. v. Diakuhara, 10 F.3d 90 , 95 (2d Cir. 1993) (first citing Traguth v. Zuck, 710 F.2d 90 , 94 (2d Cir. 1983); and
then citing Meehan v. Snow, 652 F.2d 274 , 277 (2d Cir. 1981)), and therefore ""[a] plaintiff is not entitled to default judgment
as a matter of right, merely because a party has failed to appear or respond,"" LG Funding, LLC, 2015 WL 4390453, at *2
(citing_Erwin DeMarino Trucking Co. v. Jackson, 838 F. Supp. 160 , 162 (S.D.N.Y. 1993)).

The Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for default judgment because, among other grounds, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated
their entitlement to relief on the merits. The alleged involvement of Mission Film Productions and Mission Film, Inc. in
producing and distributing the 2013 Documentary is the same as that of the Nathan Defendants. (Am. Compl. {J 81-84.)
Therefore, for the reasons that the Amended Complaint must be dismissed against the Nathan Defendants, the Court


--- Page 40 ---
denies Plaintiffs' motions for default judgment. 38
e. Leave to amend

The Joint Moving Defendants and the SPE Defendants argue that leave to amend should be denied. (Defs.' Joint Reply 1-2;
SPE Defs.' Mem. 15.)

Plaintiffs argue that they should be granted leave to amend, relying on their pro se status. (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 5;
Pls.' Opp'n to SPE Defs.' Mot. 6-7.)

While ""[a] pro se complaint 'should not be dismissed without the [cJourt's granting leave to amend at least once when a
liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated,"" Grullon v. City of New Haven. 720
F.3d 133 , 139 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Chavis v. Chappius, 618 F.3d 162 , 170 (2d Cir. 2010)), ""[lleave to amend may
properly be denied if the amendment would be futil[e],"" id. at 140 (second alteration in original) (citing_Foman v. Davis, 371
U.S. 178 , 182,83 S.Ct. 227 , 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) ). ""Futility is a determination, as a matter of law, that proposed
amendments would fail to cure prior deficiencies or to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure."" Pyskaty v. Wide World of Cars, LLC, 856 F.3d 216 , 224-25 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Panther Partners Inc. v.

Ikanos Comme'ns, Inc., 681 F.3d 114 , 119 (2d Cir. 2012)); see also Chunn v. Amtrak, 916 F.3d 204 , 208 (2d Cir. 2019) (""
[An] [almendment is futile if it fails 'to cure

[623 F.Supp.3d 144]

prior deficiencies."" (quoting Panther Partners Inc., 681 F.3d at 119 )). ""Thus, the standard for denying leave to amend based
on futility is the same as the standard for granting a motion to dismiss."" /BEW Loc. Union No. 58 Pension Tr. Fund & Annuity
Fund v. Royal Bank of Scot. Grp.. PLC, 783 F.3d 383 , 389 (2d. Cir. 2015). ""If the problems with a claim are 'substantive'
rather than the result of an ‘inadequately or inartfully pleaded’ complaint, an opportunity to replead would be ‘futile’ and
‘should be denied."" Jordan v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 91 F. Supp. 3d 491, 510 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Cuoco v.
Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99 , 112 (2d Cir. 2000)).

Plaintiffs have already been granted leave to amend once. In addition, the problems with their claims against the Joint
Moving Defendants, the SPE Defendants, and Mission Film, Inc. and Mission Film Productions are substantive. With
respect to the Joint Moving Defendants, Plaintiffs’ copyright and trademark claims are either time-barred or barred by laches,
and they also fail on the merits, and their right of publicity and unjust enrichment claims are preempted by the Copyright Act.
With respect to the SPE Defendants, Plaintiffs copyright claims fail as a matter of law; they cannot state their trademark
claims based on the SPE Defendants’ use of the phrases ""Twelve"" and ""12 O'Clock Boys"" as potential titles because they do
not own a copyright in the phrase ""Twelve"" and their claims based on the phrases ""Twelve"" and ""12 O'Clock Boys"" are also
barred by the First Amendment under Rogers; and they cannot state their trademark dilution claim because the mark is not
famous enough to support this claim, or state their unjust enrichment claim, which is premised on their trademark claims.
Lastly, with respect to Mission Film, Inc., and Mission Film Productions, because the allegations and claims against them
mirror those against the Nathan Defendants, and the issues with those claims thus also mirror the issues with the claims
against the Nathan Defendants, amendment would not help Plaintiffs establish the defaulting Defendants’ liability for the
claims alleged. Accordingly, the Court declines to grant Plaintiffs leave to amend a second time as futile. Cuoco, 222 F.3d at
112.

Ill. Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the Court stays the action against Blair pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(a). The Court grants the
Joint Moving Defendants’ joint motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ copyright claims, right of publicity and unjust
enrichment claims, and trademark claims; denies Plaintiffs' application for declaratory judgments that the Nathan
Defendants' copyrights are invalid; denies the Joint Moving Defendants’ request for dismissal under Rule 19; grants the SPE
Defendants' motion to dismiss the claims against Overbrook Entertainment, Inc., Overbrook Entertainment, LLC, and Will
Smith without prejudice for lack of personal jurisdiction and to dismiss the copyright, trademark, and unjust enrichment
claims against Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc., for failure to state a claim; denies Plaintiffs' motions for default judgments
against Mission Film, Inc., and Mission Film Productions and dismisses Plaintiffs' claims against Mission Film Productions,
which is not a suable entity, without prejudice; and denies Plaintiffs leave to amend as futile. The Court also denies
Plaintiffs' motion to strike the Oscilloscope Defendants’ motion to dismiss, portions of the joint motion to dismiss pertaining to
them, and their counterclaims.

infringe[s] Plaintiffs’ rights, then the claims against the SPE Defendants necessarily fail as well."" (SPE Defs.' Mem. 15.) Because the allegations against
the Joint Moving Defendants differ from those against the SPE Defendants, and because the joint motion has been converted into a summary judgment
motion, the Court addresses the motions separately.

& The Court does not address in this Memorandum and Order the Oscilloscope Defendants’ counterclaims for (1) declaratory judgments of
noninfringement, (2) cancellation of Plaintiffs' trademark registration, and (3) tortious interference with Oscilloscope's business relationships, raised in
their Amended Answer. (Am. Answer to Compl., Docket Entry No. 87.) On March 4, 2019, Plaintiffs notified the Court that Blair had filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy in the District of Maryland on January 28, 2019. (Letter dated Mar. 4, 2019, Docket Entry No. 40); Bankr. D. Md., No. 19-11083. Therefore,
the action against him is automatically stayed pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(a). See In re Belmonte,_931 F.3d 147 , 149 (2d Cir. 2019) (""By force of 11
U.S.C. § 362, an automatic stay was imposed...."").

As discussed below, the Court relies on the evidence submitted by the parties in evaluating the Joint Moving Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment. The Court assumes the truth of the factual allegations in the Amended Complaint for the purposes of the SPE Defendants’ motion to dismiss.
In light of Plaintiffs’ pro se status, the Court also considers and assumes the truth of the factual allegations in Plaintiffs’ opposition to the SPE Defendants’
motion. See Walker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119 , 122 n.1 (2d Cir. 2013) (finding that district courts may consider factual allegations made by a pro se party in
his papers opposing a motion to dismiss).

8. The SPE Defendants’ film premiered at a film festival in January of 2020, after their motion was filed but before briefing was complete. (SPE Defs.’
Reply 5-6.)

2. The marks are 12 O'Clock Boyz, Inc.; 12 O'Clock Girlz, Inc.; 12 O'Clock Boyz Records, LLC; 12 O'Clock Boyz, LLC; and 12 O'Clock Boyz Sports, Inc.
(Am. Compl. 4 56; Trademark Electronic Search System Results (""Trademark Registration""), annexed to Am. Compl. as Ex. 4, Docket Entry No. 98-3, at
40-43.)

10. Other dirt-bike riding groups in Baltimore, such as the Wildout Wheelie Boyz and Raise It Up, are independent business entities with their own marks.
Like the 12 O'Clock Boyz, they organize their own events, sell branded merchandise, and maintain social media accounts for their brands. (Am. Compl.
961-65.)

1 Plaintiffs do not elaborate on what these ""chapters"" are, and it is not obvious from the film.

12. The 2008 DVDs, which contain footage of riders, are separate from the 2013 Documentary, ( id. 1 73, 197), and Plaintiffs do not bring infringement
allegations concerning the 2008 DVDs. Based on the above allegations, the Court understands Plaintiffs to seek a declaratory judgment that the
copyright registration for the 2008 DVDs is invalid. ( /d. 4 192-201.)

13. Plaintiffs argued that the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries the Nathan Defendants submitted were tampered with because they were submitted on a
flash drive but only exist in DVD and VHS form. ( See, e.g., Pls.’ Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 6-7.) When the Court ordered the Nathan Defendants’ to
provide the works in DVD format for technical reasons, (Order dated Oct. 22, 2020), Plaintiffs objected to the DVDs the Nathan Defendants provided on
the ground that they are ""counterfeit."" (Decl. of Deafueh Monbo, Docket Entry No. 167.) In view of Plaintiffs’ objections, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to
provide copies of both works in DVD format. (Order dated Nov. 20, 2020.) Instead of providing copies, Plaintiffs ""again disput[ed] the accuracy of the
copies [the Nathan] Defendants submitted"" but did ""not point to any substantive inaccuracy"" in those copies and instead ""emphasize[d] a difference in
media format between the VHS tape that one [Plaintiff gave a [Nathan Defendant] and the DVDs that [the Nathan] Defendants submitted."" (Order dated
Dec. 8, 2020.) The Court therefore ordered Plaintiffs to provide ""a written description of the differences (if any) between the substance of the 2001 and
2003 works and the copies provided by [the Nathan] Defendants."" ( /d. ) Plaintiffs failed to do so, restating that the DVDs are not true copies due to their
format. Because the Court needed to view the works to decide the pending motions, but could not do so on a motion to dismiss given that the DVDs are
matters outside the pleadings, and, although integral to the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs disputed their accuracy and authenticity, the Court provided
notice to the parties of its intention to convert the Joint Moving Defendants’ motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and granted Plaintiffs
sixty days to submit additional evidence in response to the facts asserted by the Joint Moving Defendants or in further support of their claims. ( See
generally Order dated Apr. 22, 2021, Docket Entry No. 177 (collecting cases)); Weisshaus v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 814 F. App'x 643, 646 (2d Cir.
2020) (""[W]here matter[s] outside the pleadings [are] offered and not excluded by the trial court, the motion to dismiss should be converted to a motion
for summary judgment."" (alteration in original) (quoting Nakahata v. N. Y.-Presbyterian Healthcare Sys., Inc.,_723 F.3d 192 , 202 (2d Cir. 2013))), cert.
denied, — U.S. —, 141 S. Ct. 1061 , 208 L.Ed.2d 527 (2021) . Plaintiffs did not submit additional evidence.

14. Near the end of the 2013 Documentary, Pug's bike is stolen. At the end of the documentary, he is shown stealing back his bike and leaving in the van
featured in the opening scene. (2013 Documentary 59:00-1:00:30, 1:09:15-1:12:01.)

15: As noted above, Plaintiffs belatedly moved after the Joint Moving Defendants’ motion was fully briefed to strike the Oscilloscope Defendants from the
joint motion to dismiss, arguing that the Oscilloscope Defendants previously filed an Answer to the Complaint and therefore waived the right to file a
motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. (Pls.' Mot. to Strike.) The Oscilloscope Defendants oppose Plaintiffs’ motion on numerous grounds.
(Oscilloscope Defs.' Strike Opp'n.) The Court denies Plaintiffs’ motion in view of Magistrate Judge Steven Tiscione's prior orders in this case granting
Plaintiffs leave to file the Amended Complaint, (Min. Entry dated June 4, 2019, Docket Entry No. 78), and directing that ""[i]f [the Oscilloscope] Defendants
intend to move to dismiss the amended complaint, the parties shall confer and propose a joint briefing schedule,"" (Min. Entry dated July 3, 2019, Docket
Entry No. 92), and this Court's adoption of the parties' briefing schedule, (Order dated Sept. 20, 2019). In moving to dismiss the Amended Complaint prior
to filing an Answer to the Amended Complaint, the Oscilloscope Defendants acted in accordance with Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (""A motion asserting any of these defenses must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.""). Plaintiffs also
moved to strike the Oscilloscope Defendants’ counterclaims in their Amended Answer, arguing that the Oscilloscope Defendants’ Answer to the original
Complaint did not contain the counterclaims. (Pls.' Mot. to Strike 1-2.) The Court denies this motion as moot. As the Oscilloscope Defendants explain,
they originally filed a suit against Plaintiffs raising the claims that they now raise as counterclaims. (Oscilloscope Defs.' Strike Opp'n 1.) Plaintiffs
subsequently brought this suit. Because of the inefficiency of proceeding with two actions involving the same issues, Judge Tiscione allowed the
Oscilloscope Defendants to voluntarily dismiss their action and amend their Answer in this action to assert as counterclaims the claims they brought in
the other action. (Min. Entry dated June 4, 2019.) Subsequently, Plaintiffs requested a pre-motion conference to strike the Oscilloscope Defendants’


--- Page 42 ---
counterclaims on the same basis they now assert, (Pls.' Mot. for Pre-Mot. Conf., Docket Entry No. 95), and Judge Tiscione denied their request as moot
in view of his prior order, (Order dated July 11, 2019, Docket Entry No. 97).

18. The Joint Moving Defendants do not dispute the validity of Plaintiffs’ copyrights or move for summary judgment on the actual-copying prong of the
copyright test. Therefore, for purposes of considering the pending motions, the Court assumes that Plaintiffs have valid copyrights in the 2001 and 2003
Documentaries and that actual copying occurred and focuses on whether they have shown a substantial similarity between their works and the 2013
Documentary. See, e.g., de Becdelievre v. Anastasia Musical LLC, No. 16-CV-9471, 2018 WL 1633769, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2018) (""[The]
[d]efendants have not moved for summary judgment on the first prong of the copyright test — actual copying. As such, the [court assumes for the
purpose of this [summary judgment] motion that actual copying occurred.""); see also Peter F. Gaito Architecture LLC v. Simone Dev. Corp., 602 F.3d 57 ,
63 (2d Cir. 2010) (""Here, for purposes of [the] defendants’ motion to dismiss, the district court assumed (as do we) that actual copying by [the] defendants
occurred."").

12. The Pug of the 2013 Documentary is not the same individual as the Pug in the 2001 and 2003 Documentaries, as the Pug in Plaintiffs’ 2001 and 2003
works is an adult member of the 12 O'Clock Boyz and the Pug who appears in the 2013 Documentary is a young adolescent. However, it is unclear
whether the Pug in the 2013 Documentary is meant to be the same person or based on the Pug in the Plaintiffs’ works. Because the Pug in Plaintiffs’
works is not developed, these characters do not appear to share any similarities apart from their names, backwards hat, and an interest in the 12 O'Clock
Boyz.

18. Plaintiffs define ""docu-fiction"" as ""the cinematographic combination of documentary and fiction,"" or:

a film genre which attempts to capture reality such as it is ... and which simultaneously introduces unreal elements or fictional situations in
narrative in order to strengthen the representation of reality. More precisely, it is a documentary mixed with fictional elements, in real time,
filmed when the events take place, and in which the main character or characters[] — often portrayed by nonprofessional or amateur actors
— are essentially playing themselves, or slightly fictionalized versions of themselves, in a fictionalized scenario.

(Am. Compl. 29.)

18. Because Plaintiffs are domiciled in Maryland, Maryland law applies to Plaintiffs’ right of publicity claims. Federal courts in New York apply New York
choice-of-law rules in adjudicating state law claims. _Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 672 F.3d 155 , 157 (2d Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (""A federal
court sitting in diversity or adjudicating state law claims that are pendent to a federal claim must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state."" (quoting
Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994 , 1002 (2d Cir. 1989))). New York courts apply the law of the plaintiff's domicile in evaluating right of publicity claims.
Rogers, 875 F.2d at 1002 (citing Se. Bank, N.A. v. Lawrence, 66 N.Y.2d 910 , 912, 498 N.Y.S.2d 775 , 489 N.E.2d 744 (1985) ); Champion v. Moda
Operandi, Inc., 561 F. Supp. 3d 419, 442-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2021).

20. Plaintiffs cite a Florida state court case for the elements of an unjust enrichment claim, (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint Mot. 17-18), but do not state
whether the law of Maryland, New York, or another state applies. Nor do Plaintiffs explain why they cite to Florida law. ( See id. ) The Joint Moving
Defendants cite cases decided by courts in this district on the basis of New York law but also do not explain why New York law applies. ( See Defs.' Joint
Mot. 32-33.)

21. In New York, the center of gravity test looks to where a contract was made and intended to be performed. See AEI Life LLC v. Lincoln Benefit Life
Co., 892 F.3d 126 , 135 (2d Cir. 2018). Because there is no contract at issue in this case, the center of gravity test does not apply. However, the center
of gravity test weighs similar factors to the interest analysis test. See Moses v. Apple Hosp. Reit Inc., No. 14-CV-3131, 2015 WL 1014327, at *4
(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2015) (""Both [the center of gravity and interest analysis] tests focus on the parties' domiciles and the locus of the tort or harm a plaintiff
suffers.""). Because Plaintiffs' claim resembles a tort claim more than a contract claim, the Court applies the ""interest analysis"" test.

22. The Court notes that the result would be the same under New York law. In addition, under New York law, Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim based on
the unauthorized use of Taje Monbo's image or likeness would also be preempted by the New York Civil Rights Law. See, e.g., Sondik v. Kimmel, 16
N.Y.S.3d 296 , 298, 131 A.D.3d 1041 (App. Div. 2015) (""Common-law unjust enrichment claims for the unauthorized use of an image or likeness are
preempted by Civil Rights Law §§ 50 and 51.""); Velon v. Di Modolo Int'l LLC, No. 653485/2013, 2014 WL 2094130 at *2-3, 2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 2297,
at *7 (Sup. Ct. May 16, 2014) (applying New York law after interest analysis test and dismissing unjust enrichment claim because ""[u]nder [New York]
law, common law claims for ... unjust enrichment related to unauthorized use of a person's image or likeness are subsumed under Civil Rights Law §§ 50
and 51"" and collecting cases); Zoll v. Jordache Enters., Inc., No. 01-CV-1339, 2002 WL 31873461, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 24, 2002) (""A number of cases
have squarely held that common law unjust enrichment claims for unauthorized use of an image or likeness are subsumed by the Civil Rights Law.""
(collecting cases)).

23. The Court declines to address the Joint Moving Defendants’ arguments, in the alternative, that Plaintiffs’ right of publicity and unjust enrichment claims
are time-barred.

24. Because Plaintiffs’ trademark claims under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) fail for the reasons discussed, the Court does not address the Joint Moving
Defendants’ other arguments in support of their motion, including their arguments that Plaintiffs’ trademark claims fail because the mark, which is based
on the ""12 O'Clock"" term, is merely descriptive and their argument that Plaintiffs have abandoned their trademark claims by failing to respond in their
opposition to the Joint Moving Defendants’ arguments.

25. Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Moving Defendants’ infringement is continuing but offer no facts in support of their continuing infringement claim. In
general, plaintiffs may pursue claims based on infringing acts that occur after they register their marks. See CSL Silicones Inc. v. Midsun Grp. Inc., 170 F.
Supp. 3d 304, 311 (D. Conn. 2016) (collecting cases holding ""that claims sounding in trademark accrue for the purpose of a statute of limitations as to
each infringing use of the mark""); see also Rosenshine v. A. Meshi Cosmetics Indus., No. 18-CV-3572, 2020 WL 1914648, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2020)
(finding that the plaintiffs could pursue trademark claims ""for any infringement that occurred on or after"" date of registration). However, as explained
above, Plaintiffs’ claims with respect to the Joint Moving Defendants are all based on pre-registration acts, and there is no evidence in the record to
support their allegations of continuing infringement.

28. As the Joint Moving Defendants argue, to the extent Plaintiffs base their trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition
claims under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) on the Joint Moving Defendants’ failure to credit them for use of clips, including their title card, creating confusion as to
the source or origin of the 2013 Documentary, ( see, e.g., Am. Compl. { 106), these claims are also barred because, as the producers of the 2013
Documentary, the Joint Moving Defendants are the source of the 2013 Documentary, consistent with_Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.
539 U.S. 23 , 123 S.Ct. 2041 , 156 L.Ed.2d 18 (2003) . In Dastar, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (""Fox"") produced the 1948 television series
""Crusade in Europe"" based on a book written by General Dwight D. Eisenhower the same year. /d. at 25-26, 123 S.Ct. 2041 . Fox failed to renew its
copyright in the show when it expired in 1977, and, in 1995, Dastar Corporation (""Dastar"") purchased tapes of Fox's series, ""copied them, and then edited
the series,"" renaming it and selling the final product as its own, without reference to Fox's series. /d. at 26-27, 123 S.Ct. 2041 . Fox and others sued



--- Page 43 ---
Dastar alleging that its sale of the videos ""without proper credit"" to Fox's series constituted reverse passing off — a type of false designation of origin
claim — under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). /d. at 27, 123 S.Ct. 2041 . The Supreme Court held that the phrase “origin of
goods"" in section 1125(a) ""refers to the producer of the tangible goods that are offered for sale, and not to the author of any idea, concept, or
communication embodied in those goods,"" id. at 37, 123 S.Ct. 2041 , finding that ""[s]uch an extension would not only stretch the text, but it would be out
of accord with the history and purpose of the Lanham Act and inconsistent with precedent,"" id. at 32, 123 S.Ct. 2041 . In reaching this conclusion, the
court ""caution[ed] against misuse or overextension' of trademark ... into areas traditionally occupied by ... copyright,"" id. at 34, 123 S.Ct. 2041 (quoting
TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Mktg. Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23 , 29, 121 S.Ct. 1255 , 149 L.Ed.2d 164 (2001) ), explaining that the Lanham Act was ""not
designed to protect originality or creativity,"" id. at 37. Thus, ""[s]ince Dastar, Lanham Act claims arising from the alleged copying of creative work have
been ‘clearly foreclosed."" Hudson v. Universal Studios, Inc., No. 04-CV-6997, 2008 WL 4701488, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2008) (quoting_Contractual
Obligation Prods., LLC v. AMC Networks. Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 120 , 129 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)), affd, 369 F. App'x 291 (2d Cir. 2010); see, e.g., Lieb v.
Korangy Publ'g, Inc., No. 15-CV-40, 2016 WL 8711195, at “10 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2016) (finding false designation of origin claim barred by Dastar and
collecting cases); see also Vaad L'Hafotzas Sichos, Inc. v. Krinsky, 133 F. Supp. 3d 527, 538 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (""Under Dastar, then, the law of unfair
competition does not allow a claim for false or misleading representations as to the origin of the content of a ‘communicative product.""’); Contractual
Obligation Prods., LLC,_546 F. Supp. 2d at 124 (""[The] plaintiff's trademark infringement claim was foreclosed by the Supreme Court's ruling in Dastar
that the Lanham Act does not apply to claims arising out of a failure to attribute or credit the origin of creative work.""); see also Narrative Ark Ent. LLC v.
Archie Comic Publ'ns, Inc., No. 16-CV-6109, 2017 WL 3917040, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2017) (finding unfair competition claim under New York law,
which is evaluated under the same standard as 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), barred by Dastar).

27. Plaintiffs bring their contributory and vicarious trademark infringement claims pursuant to ""federal law and the Maryland common law"" and “federal law
and common law."" (Am. Compl. 9§ 249-259.) The Court is not aware of causes of action for contributory and vicarious trademark infringement under the
Maryland common law and understands Plaintiffs to be asserting these claims under the Lanham Act. The Court also understands Plaintiffs’ references to
the common law as acknowledging the fact that the doctrines of contributory and vicarious liability were imported into trademark law from the common
law of torts. See, e.g., Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay Inc., 600 F.3d 93 , 104 (2d Cir. 2010) (""Contributory trademark infringement is a judicially created doctrine
that derives from the common law of torts.""); Deborah F. Buckman, Annotation, Liability as Vicarious or Contributory Infringer Under Lanham Act —
Modern Cases, 152 A.L.R. Fed. 573 (2022) (""Although the [Supreme Court in Inwood Laboratories Inc. v. lves Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844 , 854,
102 S.Ct. 2182 , 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982) ] established the standard for contributory trademark infringement, many courts have also recognized vicarious
trademark liability, basically applying the legal standards and rules established by the common law."" (footnote omitted)); Andrew Ligon Fant, Note,
Reconsidering the Willful Blindness Doctrine in Contributory Trademark Infringement, 29 J. Intell. Prop. L. 318, 324 (Spring 2022) (""No provision of the
Lanham Act created a cause of action of secondary infringement.... [C]ourts imported both vicarious and contributory liability doctrines into trademark law
from the common law of torts."").

28. Because these claims are not relevant to the issues being decided, the Court declines to address the Joint Moving Defendants' alternative arguments
that the Court should dismiss these causes of action because they would be redundant of Plaintiffs’ affirmative claims and because they are time-barred.

2. In a cease-and-desist letter written by Deafueh Monbo and ""authorized by Taje Monbo,"" Deafueh Monbo states that ""Taje Monbo and Danielle Avent
own the copyright in the motion picture entitled '12 O'Clock Boyz."" (Letter dated Feb. 18, 2016 from Deafueh Monbo (d/b/a 12 O'Clock Boyz) to
Overbrook Entertainment, Will Smith, and James Lassiter, annexed to Am. Compl. as Ex. 42, Docket Entry 99-2, at 9; see also Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Joint
Mot. 7.)

30. The Court takes judicial notice that 12 O'Clock Boyz, Inc. was a Maryland company that formed in 2001 and filed articles of dissolution in 2002. See
12 O'CLOCK BOYZ INC.: D06356109, https://egov.maryland.gov/BusinessExpress/EntitySearch/Business|nformation/D06356109 (last visited Aug. 25,
2022).

31. The SPE Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs’ claims relating to a motion picture that has yet to be released are not ripe for adjudication because their
work has not been finalized, and therefore the Court cannot compare it to Plaintiffs’ work, and Plaintiffs cannot have been harmed by a movie that is yet
to be released. (SPE Defs.' Mem. 15-17.) In response, Plaintiffs argue that the claims are ripe because they are based on the SPE Defendants'
""utilization of similar character, theme, setting and mood"" in their forthcoming adaptation, and that the script and a filmed scene are enough. (Pls.' Opp'n
to SPE Defs.' Mot. 12.) As noted above, the SPE Defendants' film premiered at a film festival in January of 2020, after the motions were filed but before
briefing was complete. (SPE Defs.' Reply 5-6.) Because the SPE Defendants' arguments as to why Plaintiffs’ claim is not ripe have been superseded by
the premiere of the film, the Court does not address the ripeness argument.

32. The SPE Defendants do not challenge the Court's jurisdiction over Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc.

33. The SPE Defendants request that the Court take judicial notice of a list of films with similar titles. Plaintiffs dispute whether judicial notice is
appropriate. ( See Pls.' Objs. to Defs.' Request for Jud. Notice, Docket Entry No. 143.) The Court declines to take judicial notice of the requested items.

34. Plaintiffs allege that this advertising is contained in Exhibit 59 to the Amended Complaint. Exhibit 59 consists of Twitter posts by third-parties
retweeting and commenting on the announcement that rap artist Meek Mill was going to star in a feature film adaptation of ""12 O'Clock Boys, an
upcoming adaptation of Lotfy Nathan's 2013 documentary of the same name."" ( See generally Social Media Posts, annexed to Am. Compl. as Ex. 59,
Docket Entry No. 99-2, at 81-152.)

35. Because the Court grants the SPE Defendants’ motion as to Plaintiffs’ trademark claims on these grounds, the Court declines to consider the SPE
Defendants’ additional arguments that their use of the phrase ""12 O'Clock Boys"" as a potential title is fair use and that Plaintiffs have abandoned their
trademark claims by failing to respond to the SPE Defendants' arguments.

38. Because Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim with respect to the SPE Defendants concerns a claim of trademark infringement, not copyright
infringement, the preemption rules of the Copyright Act are inapplicable. See, e.g., RBC Nice Bearings. Inc. v. Peer Bearing Co., 676 F. Supp. 2d 9 , 34
(D. Conn. 2009) (finding that Copyright Act did not preempt state law claims to the extent they asserted a violation of the plaintiffs’ trademark rights), aff'd,
410 F. App'x 362 (2d Cir. 2010); see also Transcience Corp. v. Big Time Toys, LLC, 50 F. Supp. 3d 441, 454 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (""[T]he Copyright Act does
not fully preempt state law claims where the claims also seek to protect trademark rights.""); MyPlayCity, Inc. v. Conduit Ltd., No. 10-CV-1615, 2012 WL
1107648, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2012) (""Unlike the Copyright Act, however, the Lanham Act does not preempt state law. [The plaintiff's] unjust
enrichment claim is thus not preempted to the extent that it asserts [the defendant's] violation of [the plaintiff's] trademark rights.""), adhered to on
reconsideration, 2012 WL 2929392 (S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2012).

82. although the SPE Defendants reside in California, ""there is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment."" Everett v. Mountains Recreation &
Conservation Auth., 239 Cal. App. 4th 541 , 553, 191 Cal.Rptr.3d 59 (2015) (quoting Melchior v. New Line Prods.. Inc., 106 Cal. App. 4th 779 , 793, 131

Cal.Rptr.2d 347 (2006) ); see also Graham-Sult v. Clainos, 738 F.3d 1131 , 1156 (9th Cir. 2013) (finding, absent a cause of action in California for unjust
enrichment, that [the] [p]laintiffs' Tenth Cause of Action therefore fails to state a claim, and the district court properly dismissed it without leave to

amend"").

38: In addition, a defendant must be ""a separate legal entity with the capacity to be sued.""_Schiavone v. Fortune, 477 U.S. 21 , 23 n.2, 106 S.Ct. 2379 , 91

L.Ed.2d 18 (1986) . As noted above, Mochin alleges that Mission Film Productions is a trade name. (Mochin Answer.) At the motion to dismiss stage, the
Court cannot rely on Mochin's assertion but notes that a trade name is not a legal entity. See Mattel, Inc. v. Adventure Apparel, No. 00-CV-4085, 2001
WL 286728, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2001) (explaining that a trade name is not a legal entity).

OPINION AND ORDER

DENISE COTE, DISTRICT JUDGE:

George Santos brings this action against James C. Kimmel, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. (“ABC”) and the
Walt Disney Company (“Disney”) for copyright infringement and related

2

state law claims. The defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint (“FAC”) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R.
Civ. P., principally relying on the fair use defense. For the following reasons, the motion is granted.

Background

The following facts are taken from the FAC, incorporated exhibits, and documents of which a court may take judicial
notice. For the purposes of deciding this motion, the complaint's factual allegations are accepted as true, and all reasonable
inferences are drawn in the plaintiff's favor.

George Santos is a public figure and former member of the United States House of Representatives. In May 2023,
Santos was indicted on federal charges of, inter alia , wire fraud in connection with a fraudulent political scheme, money
laundering, and theft of public funds. He was expelled from Congress on December 1, 2023.

ABC is a commercial broadcast television network. Kimmel is the executive producer and host of ABC's late-night talk
show Jimmy Kimmel Live! (“JKL”). Disney is the parent company of ABC.

Shortly after his expulsion from Congress, Santos created an account on www.cameo.com (“Cameo”), a website that
allows fans (“Users”) to request personalized video messages from

3

public figures and celebrities (“Talent”). Santos's Cameo account drew media attention as early as December 4, 2023. On
December 6 and 7, defendants created multiple Cameo accounts using fake names, and submitted at least fourteen
requests for Cameo videos from Santos using these accounts. Santos created fourteen videos in response. This litigation
relates to defendants’ public use of five videos on JKL.

By creating accounts on Cameo, Talent and Users agree to be bound by Cameo's Terms of Service, which are
incorporated by reference in the FAC. The Terms of Service provide that by creating an account, the account holder agrees


--- Page 2 ---
“not to create a Site account using a false identity or providing false information.” Under the Terms of Service, Users may
request personalized videos from Talent and obtain a license to use those videos.

Cameo offers two types of licenses: personal use licenses and commercial use licenses. A personal use license grants
the User a license

solely for your own personal, non-commercial, and non-promotional purposes , subject to these Terms: a
nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide, sublicensable, revocable license to use, reproduce, distribute,
and publicly display that CAMEO Video, in any and all media (for example, on social media platforms), whether
now known or hereafter invented or devised.

A commercial license grants “an exclusive (except as to the license granted to Cameo), royalty-free, fully paid,
worldwide, sublicensable, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, distribute, and publicly display” the video on a variety of
media for reasonable promotional purposes. A commercial license “specifically exclude[es], in all cases, television.”

Each video created by Talent is owned by the creator, but uploading a video grants Cameo “a non-exclusive, royalty-
free, fully paid, unlimited, universal, sublicensable (through multiple tiers of sublicenses), perpetual, and irrevocable license
in any and all manner and media” in that video. Each of the defendants’ requested videos were subject to the personal use
license restrictions.

Defendants' Cameo requests included the following:

- “George please congratulate my friend Gary Fortuna for winning the Clearwater Florida Beef Eating Contest.
He ate almost 6 pounds of loose ground beef in under 30 minutes -- which was a new record! He's not feeling
great right now but the doctor thinks he will be released from the hospital soon. Please wish him a speedy
recovery!”

- “George please congratulate my mom Brenda on the successful cloning of her beloved schnauzer Adolf. She
and Doctor Haunschnaffer went through a lot of dogs in the trial runs but they finally got it to stick. Tell her to give
Adolf a big belly rub for me!”

- “George can you please congratulate my legally blind niece Julia on passing her driving test. They said she
couldn't do it -- even shouldn't, but she's

taught herself to be able to drive safely using her other senses. She's not a quitter! That said, the day after she
got her license, she got in a really bad car accident so if you could also wish her a speedy recovery that would be
amazing. She's in a bodycast and is very bummed out -- but with help from Jesus and President Trump, soon
she will be back on the road!”

- “Hey George. My friend Heath just came out as a Furry and I'd love for you to tell him that his friends and family
all accept him. His ‘fursona' is a platypus mixed with a beaver. He calls it a beav-a-pus. Can you say we all love
you Beav-a-pus? He also just got the go ahead from Arby's corporate to go to work in the outfit so we're all so
happy for him to be himself at work and at home. Could you also do a loud ‘Yiff yiff yiff!'? That's the sound a
Beav-a-pus makes as a Beav-a-pus. Thank you so much.”

Starting on December 7, Kimmel introduced a segment on JKL called “Will Santos Say It?”, which he introduced by
stating that “disgraced former Congressman George Santos . . . has a new gig making videos on Cameo for $400 a pop.”
Kimmel stated that this was “a dilemma because on the one hand you don't want to give your money to a guy like George
Santos but on the other, pretty good chance he had your credit card information already.” Kimmel stated that he sent Santos
a number of “ridiculous requests ....| didn't say they were from me | just wrote them and sent them to find out ‘Will Santos
Say It."" Kimmel then introduced three of the videos, each time asking his audience “Will Santos Say It?” before playing the
video in full.

6

Defendants ran the segment again on December 11. Before showing the videos, Kimmel remarked that “every time
[President Donald Trump] gets indicted he rakes in the cash but George Santos [is] not doing too badly himself.” Kimmel
stated

| sent [Santos] a bunch of crazy video requests because | wanted to see what he would read and what he
wouldn't read, and | showed some of them on the air on Thursday . . . and now he's demanding . . . to be paid a
commercial rate. Could you imagine if | get sued by George Santos for fraud?

He then showed two more of the videos. Defendants posted both segments on various social media, including
Youtube. On December 12, Santos sent defendants a demand letter requesting them to cease showing the videos and
remove the content from social media. Defendants did refrain from posting the remaining videos, but did not remove content
they had previously published on social media platforms and the defendants' website. Santos has registered each of the


--- Page 3 ---
videos shown on JKL (the “Videos”) with the Register of Copyrights pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 411(a).

Santos filed the initial complaint in this action on February 17, 2024, alleging copyright infringement, fraudulent
inducement, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. Following a conference on April 18, an Order of the same date set a
deadline for the initial motion to dismiss and the filing of any amended complaint in response to that motion. The Order
provided that it was unlikely that plaintiff would have a

7

further opportunity to amend. The defendants moved to dismiss the initial complaint on April 29. Santos filed the FAC on
May 24, adding an additional claim for breach of implied contract, and defendants renewed their motion on June 7.
Defendants’ motion was fully submitted on July 3.

Discussion

To survive a motion to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,
accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Doe v. Franklin Square Union Free School Dist. , 100
F.4th 86 , 94 (2d Cir. 2024) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 , 678 (2009)). “A claim has facial plausibility when the
plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the
misconduct alleged.” Vengalattore v. Cornell Univ. , 36 F.4th 87 , 102 (2d Cir. 2022) (quoting Ashcroft , 556 U. S. Reports
678 ). “In determining if a claim is sufficiently plausible to withstand dismissal, a court “must accept as true all allegations in
the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.” Doe , 100 F.4th at 94 (citation omitted).
When assessing the pleadings on a motion to dismiss, a court

may review only a narrow universe of materials, which includes facts stated on the face of the complaint,
documents appended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by reference, matters of which judicial

notice may be taken, as well as documents not expressly incorporated by reference in the complaint that are
nevertheless integral to the complaint.

Clark v. Hanley , 89 F.4th 78 , 93 (2d Cir. 2023) (citation omitted).

Defendants argue that the FAC fails to state a claim for copyright infringement because the complaint clearly
establishes that their inclusion of the Videos on JKL constituted fair use. Fair use is an affirmative defense, and is thus most
frequently resolved at summary judgment. An affirmative defense may be raised by a pre-answer motion to dismiss,
however, “if the defense appears on the face of the complaint.” Whiteside v. Hover-Davis, Inc. , 995 F.3d 315 , 319 (2d Cir.
2021) (citation omitted). The Second Circuit has specifically acknowledged “the possibility of fair use being so clearly
established by a complaint as to support dismissal of a copyright infringement claim.” TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum ,
839 F.3d 168 , 178 (2d Cir. 2016).

A. Copyright Infringement

Exercising its constitutional power, Congress has granted an author of original work that is fixed in a tangible medium
of expression the exclusive right to produce the work. See Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc. ,593 U.S. 1 , 16-17 (2021).
The purpose of the Copyright Act “is to secure a fair return for an author's creative labor,” and “the ultimate aim is, by this

9

incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.” Twentieth Cent. Music Corp. v. Aiken , 422 U.S. 151,
156 (1974) (citation omitted).

Section 501 of the Copyright Act provides that “[a]nyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
as provided by sections 106 through 122 [of the Copyright Act] . . . is an infringer of the copyright or right of the author.” 17
U.S.C. § 501(a). Under § 106, those rights include reproduction, public performance, public display, creation of derivative
works, and distribution. 17 U.S.C. § 106. The various provisions of the Copyright Act reflect “a balance of competing claims
upon the public interest: Creative work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the
cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts.” Andy Warhol Found. for Visual Arts, Inc.
v. Goldsmith , 598 U.S. 508 , 526 (2023) (citation omitted).

“A claim of direct copyright infringement requires proof that (1) the plaintiff had a valid copyright in the work, and (2) the
defendant infringed the copyright by violating one of the exclusive rights that 17 U.S.C. § 106 bestows upon the copyright
holder.” Smith v. Barnesandnoble.com, LLC , 839 F.3d 163 , 166 (2d Cir. 2016). The defendants do not dispute that

10

Santos has a valid copyright in each of the Videos. They argue, however, that the use of the videos constitutes fair use and
does not violate Santos's rights, because “a copyright holder may not prevent another person from making a ‘fair use' of


--- Page 4 ---
copyrighted material.” Google , 593 U. S. Reports 18. As explained below, they are correct.
1. Fair use
Section 107 of the Copyright Act codifies the fair use doctrine and provides that

the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other
means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting , teaching (including
multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.

17 U.S.C. § 107 (emphasis added). To determine whether the use of a work is a fair use, the following factors must be
considered:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion
used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work.

Id.

The statutory embodiment of the doctrine “indicates, rather than dictates,” how the doctrine applies. Google , 593 U. S.
Reports 18 . All four factors listed in § 107 “are to be explored, and

11

the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.” Andy Warhol Found. for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith , 11
F.4th 26 , 37 (2d Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). The list of factors is not exhaustive. Google , 593 U. S. Reports 19. Instead,
fair use is a “flexible” concept. Warhol! , 598 U.S. at 527 (citation omitted). “[T]he party asserting fair use bears the burden of

proof.” Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202 , 213 (2d Cir. 2015). Each of the four factors is discussed in turn, and the
results weighed together.

i. Purpose of Use

This factor “considers the reasons for, and nature of, the copier's use of an original work,” with the central question
being “whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation[,] (supplanting the original), or instead
adds something new, with a further purpose or different character.” Warhol , 598 U.S. at 528 (citation omitted). A use that
has a further purpose is said to be “transformative.” /d. at 529. Where a copied work is being used for one of the purposes
identified in the preamble of § 107, there is a “strong presumption” in favor of fair use. NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst. , 364 F.3d
471 , 477 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). “Among the best recognized justifications for copying from another's work is to
provide comment on it or criticism of it.” Authors Guild , 804 F.3d at 215 . This is because “[c]riticism of a work. . .

12

ordinarily does not supersede the objects of, or supplant, the work. Rather, it uses the work to serve a distinct end.” Warhol ,
598 U. S. Reports 528.

Santos argues that because the defendants themselves solicited the Videos, the defendants’ subsequent use of the
Videos was not transformative. Defendants argue that their use of the Videos was squarely for purposes of criticism and
comment and thus this factor weighs in favor of fair use. Defendants are correct.

It is clear from the face of the FAC and the YouTube clips of the JKL segments incorporated by reference into the FAC
that the defendants copied the Videos for the transformative purposes of criticism and commentary. As alleged in the FAC,
Cameo is a website that allows fans to “request personalized video messages from public figures and celebrities.” The FAC.
asserts that Santos created the Videos “to generate an inspiring message” and “convey|] his feelings of hope, strength,
perseverance, encouragement, and positivity.” In contrast, any reasonable observer of the JKL segments during which the
Videos were shown would understand that their inclusion on the show served as criticism of and commentary on a
newsworthy public figure.

Kimmel prefaced the broadcast of the first of the three Videos by noting that the “disgraced former Congressman
George

13

Santos has a new gig making videos on Cameo for $400 a pop,” making a joke about Santos's indictment for wire fraud by
stating that there's a “good chance he already has your credit card information,” and stating that he had sent “ridiculous
requests” to Santos in order “to find out ‘Will Santos Say It.” Before showing each Video, Kimmel read the request to the
audience and asked the audience “Will Santos Say It?” Kimmel then played the Videos in full and, between Videos,
interjected his own commentary.


--- Page 5 ---
In short, a reasonable observer would understand that JKL showed the Videos to comment on the willingness of
Santos -- a public figure who had recently been expelled from Congress for allegedly fraudulent activity including enriching
himself through a fraudulent contribution scheme -- to say absurd things for money. Thus, the Videos were used for political

commentary and criticism, purposes that do not supersede the “objects” of the original Videos. Warhol! , 598 U. S. Reports
539 [1]

14

Moreover, “a further justification for [JKL's] use of [the Videos] is apparent” in that the segments “target” the Videos. /d.
at 539-540. ""[Commentary or criticism that targets an original work may have compelling reason to ‘conjure up' the original
by borrowing from it.” /d. at 532 (citation omitted). Here, ""the original copyrighted work is, at least in part, the object of”
Kimmel's commentary. /d. at 540. It is ""the very nature” of the Videos -- that is, the fact that Santos was willing to read the
requested messages on camera for $400 -""that enables the commentary.” /d.

Santos's argument that the defendants should not be able to ""seek refuge in the fair use concept of transformation that
they themselves manufactured through deceit” finds no support in copyright law. Defendants’ conduct may have been

deceptive and unkind, but the Supreme Court in Warhol emphasized that whether a work is transformative turns on neither
the ""subjective intent of the user,” 598 U. S. Reports 544, nor the ""stated or perceived intent of the artist.” /d. at 545 (citation
omitted). A court must instead conduct ""an objective inquiry into what use was made, i.e. , what the user does with the
original work.” /d. Here, the purpose of the defendants’ use was clearly for criticism and commentary of the Videos
themselves and their author.

15

Santos also argues that the commercial nature of defendants’ use and their “bad faith” in soliciting the videos weigh
against fair use. But, while “a finding that copying was not commercial in nature tips the scales in favor of fair use. . . the

inverse is not necessarily true, as many common fair uses are indisputably commercial.” Google , 539 U. S. Reports 32.
Here, even though JKL's use was in the course of a commercial endeavor, “that is not dispositive of the first factor,

particularly in light of the inherently transformative role” of the Videos when shown on JKL. /d.

Next, an infringer acts in bad faith where it is aware that its access to the original “was unauthorized or was derived
from a violation of law or breach of duty.” NX/VM , 364 F.3d at 478 . Even assuming that defendants acted in bad faith here
by procuring personal-use licenses using accounts with fake names (rather than forthrightly negotiating a commercial fee),
bad faith is not dispositive “of the fair use question, or even of the first factor.” /d. at 479 (citation omitted). Here, “the first
factor still favors defendants in light of the transformative nature of the secondary use as criticism.” /d.

ii. Nature of Work
The second factor under § 107

directs courts to consider the nature of the copyrighted work, including (1) whether it is expressive or creative or
more factual, with a greater leeway being allowed to a

16

claim of fair use where the work is factual or informational, and (2) whether the work is published or unpublished,
with the scope of fair use involving unpublished works being considerably narrower.

Warhol , 11 F.4th 26 , 45 (2d Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). This factor generally favors the fair use defense when a
copyrighted work is more “informational or functional” than “creative”. 4 Nimmer on Copyright § 13F.06 [A] (2024). The
second factor has “rarely,” however, played a significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute since even factual
works are entitled to copyright protection. Authors Guild , 804 F.3d at 220 .

The second factor of § 107 does not weigh strongly either in favor of or against the fair use defense. As to the first
subfactor, the FAC alleges that the videos were “created by Santos using his own effort, creativity, and unique personality
traits” and “capture Santos's unique and distinctive form of motivational expression both in the personalized and engaging
manner in which the videos are captured and in the originality with which Santos conveys his feelings of hope, strength,
perseverance, encouragement, and positivity.” Although the defendants wrote the messages, Santos added some language
and original touches. Santos likely also made choices as a videographer about lighting and framing of the Videos. Taking all
allegations in the FAC as true and drawing all reasonable

17
inferences in favor of the plaintiff, the Videos are more expressive than factual.

The second subfactor favors defendants. Santos's copyright registrations state that all of the Videos were published on
the same days as they were created. Per the Cameo Terms of Service, uploading a Talent video to the platform grants
Cameo an irrevocable license “to use, reproduce, license, distribute, modify, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, and


--- Page 6 ---
create derivative works” of the video. Uploading a video also grants to the User and the recipient (if different from the User)
a non-exclusive, perpetual license to use, reproduce, distribute, and publicly display the video. Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 101,
“publication” includes “offering to distribute copies . . . to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public
performance, or public display.” Thus, Santos published the Videos when he uploaded them to Cameo. Because the first
subfactor favors Santos and the second favors defendants, the second factor weighs against fair use, but only slightly so.

iii. Portion of the Work

The third factor considers “the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a
whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). Even “a small amount” of copying may fall outside the scope of the fair use doctrine where the
excerpt copied “consists of the ‘heart” of the original work.

18

Google , 593 U. S. Reports 33 (citation omitted). On the other hand, a court may consider whether the substantiality of the
challenged use “was tethered to a valid, and transformative, purpose.” /d. at 34. Copying “the entirety of a work is sometimes
necessary to make a fair use.” Swatch Group Management Services Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. , 756 F.3d 73 , 90 (2d Cir.
2014). The “ultimate question under this factor is whether the quantity and value of the materials used are reasonable in
relation to the purpose of the copying.” Warhol , 11 F.4th at 46 (citation omitted).

The third factor is neutral with respect to the fair use defense. It is undisputed that the Videos were aired in their
entirety on JKL; however, here, the use was transformative. The use of the Videos to criticize and comment on a public
figure would have been undermined by showing less than the entirety of the Videos, because the audience would not know
whether Santos had indeed said everything in the requests. Thus, the third factor does not weigh against a finding of fair
use.

iv. Effect on Market

The fourth factor under § 107 considers “whether, if the challenged use becomes widespread, it will adversely affect
the potential market for the copyrighted work” and for the market for any derivative work. Warhol , 11 F.4th at 48 (citation
omitted). The question is whether the copying “ usurps the market for the first by offering a competing substitute.”

19

Id. at 48. In weighing this factor, a court may consider where appropriate any public benefits or harms from the copying and
their extent. Google , 593 U.S. at 35-36. There is, however, “no protectible derivative market for criticism,” because “[t]he
market for potential derivative uses includes only those that creators of original works would in general develop or license
others to develop,” and “the unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their
own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market.” Campbell ,510 U. S. Reports 592

The fourth factor of § 107 does not weigh against a finding of fair use. If anything, it weighs in favor of fair use.
Defendants' use of the Videos “are undoubtedly transformative secondary uses intended as a form of criticism,” and “[alll of
the alleged harm arises from the biting criticism of this fair use, not from a usurpation of the market by defendants.” NX/VM ,
364 F.3d at 482 (citation omitted).

Moreover, the “public benefits the copying will likely produce” are “related to copyright's concern for the creative
production of new expression.” Google , 593 U. S. Reports 35. That is, the production of criticism and satirical commentary
would be stifled if users of a work were required to obtain permission from its creator. The public benefits of criticism are

20

“comparatively important . .. when compared with dollar amounts likely lost.” /d. at 35-36.

Santos argues that defendants’ use devalued the market for Cameo videos, including Santos's, by “undermining the
integrity” of the Cameo.com platform. Santos does not explain how any impact on the popularity of the Cameo platform --
which is entirely speculative -- impacts more specifically the public interest in the creative production of new expression.
Moreover, the FAC identifies no harm to the potential or existing market for the Videos that Santos created for the
defendants, other than the “very use at bar.” Swatch , 756 F.3d at 91 (citation omitted). Thus, this factor weighs in favor of
fair use.

v. Consideration of All Fair Use Factors

Taking all four factors into consideration, the defense of fair use is clearly established by the FAC and documents
integral to it. The defendants’ use of the Videos was transformative; “transformative uses tend to favor a fair use finding
because a transformative use is one that communicates something new and different from the original or expands its utility,
thus serving copyright's overall objective of contributing to public knowledge.” Authors Guild , 804 F.3d at 214 . While the
second factor weighs slightly against the fair use defense, the third factor does not, and the fourth factor


--- Page 7 ---
21
favors the defense. Thus, defendants’ motion to dismiss Santos's claim for copyright infringement is granted.
Il. Fraudulent Inducement

Santos alleges that by creating fake profiles and falsely representing themselves as fans seeking personalized videos
for personal use, the defendants fraudulently induced Santos to provide the requested videos. Defendants argue that his
claim fails because he has failed to allege that he suffered any monetary loss as a result of their representations. They are
correct.

The elements of fraudulent inducement under New York law are 1) a misrepresentation or material omission of fact
which was false and known to be false by the defendant 2) made for the purpose of inducing the other party to rely upon it;
3) justifiable reliance of the other party on the misrepresentation or material omission; and 4) resulting injury. Ambac
Assurance Corporation v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. , 31 N.Y.3d 569 , 578-79 (2018).!2] Under New York's “out-of-
pocket” rule, “damages are to be calculated to compensate plaintiffs for what they lost because of the fraud, not to
compensate them for what they might

22

have gained” in the absence of fraud. Connaughton v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 29 N.Y.3d 137 , 142 (2017) (citation
omitted). New York law does not allow “damages for fraud based on the loss of a contractual bargain.” /d. at 142-43 (citation
omitted).

Defendants are correct that the FAC fails to allege injury resulting from any fraud. The FAC alleges damages in an
amount no less than the difference between the cost the defendants paid for the videos and the price of an expedited
commercial license for each video -- that is, the FAC seeks the “recovery of profits which would have been realized in the
absence of fraud,” not out-of-pocket economic loss caused by defendants’ misrepresentations. /d. at 142. Thus, the claim for
fraudulent inducement is dismissed.

Ill. Breach of Contrac'

Santos next asserts breach of contract and breach of implied contract claims against the defendants. [3] The FAC
alleges that plaintiff and defendants entered into valid contracts for personal licenses for all fourteen of the videos recorded
by Santos, and that defendants breached those contracts by a) failing to pay the required amount for the use of the videos

23

contemplated by defendants and b) providing false information in contravention of the Cameo Terms of Service. Defendants
argue that these claims are preempted by the Copyright Act and that, in any case, Santos has failed to allege the existence
of an actual or implied contract between himself and defendants. These claims are dismissed as preempted by the
Copyright Act.

“[T]he Copyright Act preempts state law claims asserting rights equivalent to those protected within the general scope
of the statute.” Melendez v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc. , 50 F.4th 294 , 300 (2d Cir. 2022) (citation omitted). Section 301 of the
Copyright Act addresses the issue of preemption, stating that

On and after January 1, 1978, all legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within
the general scope of copyright as specified by section 106 in works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible
medium of expression and come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections 102 and 103,
whether created before or after that date and whether published or unpublished, are governed exclusively by this
title. Thereafter, no person is entitled to any such right or equivalent right in any such work under the common
law or statutes of any State.

17 U.S.C. § 301(a) (emphasis supplied).

A state law claim is preempted by the Copyright Act if it meets two requirements: a subject matter requirement and a
general scope requirement. Melendez , 50 F.4th at 300-01 . “The subject matter requirement of the test is satisfied when the
plaintiff's claim applies to a work of authorship fixed in a

24

tangible medium of expression and falling within the ambit of one of the categories of copyrightable works.” /d. at 301
(citation omitted).

For the general scope requirement of the test to be satisfied, “the state-created right may be abridged by an act that
would, by itself, infringe one of the exclusive rights provided by federal copyright law.” /d. (citation omitted). “In evaluating the
application of this prong, a court looks at the right being asserted . . . and requires . . . that the right be equivalent to any of
the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section 106 of the Copyright Act.” /d. (citation


--- Page 8 ---
omitted). If the claim is “predicated upon an act incorporating elements beyond mere reproduction or the like,” it will not be
preempted. /d. at 302. “Rather than simply performing a mechanical search for extra elements,” however, courts applying
this test must engage in a “holistic evaluation of the nature of the rights sought to be enforced and then make a

determination whether the state law action is qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim.” /d. (citation omitted).
Preemption thus turns on “what the plaintiff seeks to protect, the theories in which the matter is thought to be protected and
the rights sought to be enforced.”

25

Universal Instruments Corporation v. Micro Systems Engineering, Inc., 924 F.3d 32 , 48 (2d Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).
Preemption “cannot be avoided simply by labeling a claim ‘breach of contract.” /d. (citation omitted).

Here, both the subject matter and general scope requirements are met. The state claims apply to the fourteen videos
created and copyrighted by Santos. As to general scope, the nature of the rights Santos seeks to enforce by his claims for
breach of contract (express or implied) are those protected by § 106.

Santos's contract claims are based on two alleged breaches by the defendants: first, that they failed to pay the
required amount for the use of the videos that they contemplated; and second, that they breached the Cameo Terms of
Service by using false information to create Cameo accounts. The first theory is clearly preempted by the Copyright Act. As
defendants rightly point out, any time a defendant is alleged to have exceeded the scope of a license that was purchased,

the parties could hypothetically have agreed to a broader license covering the use at a different price. [4] The essence of
that claim is thus that defendants' use of the Videos exceeded the scope of the licenses that they did purchase. That is, the
right Santos seeks to

26
enforce are equivalent to the right to publicly “perform” his copyrighted works. 17 U.S.C. § 106(4).

The second theory offered by the FAC is that defendants breached their contract with Cameo by providing false
information in contravention of the Terms of Service, and that Santos can enforce this provision as a third-party beneficiary.
Thus, he argues, his claim is “predicated upon an act incorporating elements beyond mere reproduction or the like,” such
that it is not preempted. Melendez, 50 F.4th at 302 . This argument fails. The FAC alleges that defendants’ provision of false
information to Cameo caused damages “in an amount no less than the difference between the cost that Defendants paid
and the price of the expedited commercial licence[s].” In other words, the FAC alleges that by lying about their identity,
defendants deceived Santos into granting them personal, rather than commercial, licenses.

Thus, the FAC's contract claims are ultimately “aimed at stopping” the public display of his copyrighted works without a
proper license, not at the defendants’ use of false information to procure the Videos. /d. at 308; see also Universal

Instruments , 924 F.3d at 49 (holding Copyright Act preempts breach of contract claim against licensor for exceeding scope
of purchased license). “In other words, [Santos's] claims are in

27

no meaningful fashion distinguishable from infringement of a copyright."" Melendez, 50 F. 4th at 308 . Thus, defendants'
motion is granted as to the claims for breach of express and implied contract.

Conclusion

The defendants' June 7, 2024 motion to dismiss is granted. The Clerk of Court shall enter judgment for the defendants.

Notes:

The Supreme Court has emphasized that it is not the subjective intent of the user, or the subjective interpretation of a court, that determines the
purpose of the use. Warhol , 598 U. S. Reports 544 . “But the meaning of a secondary work, as reasonably can be perceived, should be considered to
the extent necessary to determine whether the purpose of the use is distinct from the original, for instance, because the use comments on, criticizes, or
provides otherwise unavailable information about the original.” Id. at 544-545.

[2] Defendants cite New York law in their motion to dismiss. Plaintiff does not dispute that New York law applies to this action. “[W]here the parties agree

that [New York] law controls, this is sufficient to establish choice of law.” Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania v. Equitas Insurance Limited ,
68 F.4th 774 , 779 n.2 (2d Cir. 2023).

Santos abandoned his claim for unjust enrichment in his opposition to the motion to dismiss. Even had he not, this claim would be preempted by the
Copyright Act. See In re Jackson , 972 F.3d 25 , 44 (2d Cir. 2020).

Further, the FAC itself acknowledges that neither the commercial nor personal licenses permit Users to broadcast Cameo videos on television.

MEMORANDUM & ORDER

TALWANI, United States District Judge

Eight years ago, Dawn Dorland Perry (""Dorland"") wrote a letter about her altruistic kidney donation and shared that
letter with Sonya Larson (""Larson"") and others. After reading Dorland's letter, Larson wrote a short story entitled The Kindest
, in which a kidney recipient is none too happy to receive a letter from her living donor.

When Dorland read an online version of The Kindest in 2018, she noted the similarities between her letter and the letter
in the story. Dorland alerted publishers, writing conferences, and journalists to what she considered Larson's plagiarism and
ethical betrayal. Dorland's communications resulted in The Kindest being pulled from online publication with American Short
Fiction. They also resulted in the Boston Book Festival cancelling its annual One City, One Story event, which had planned
to feature The Kindest in 2018.

Larson filed suit against Dorland, claiming that Dorland's allegations of plagiarism
[693 F.Supp.3d 68]

amounted to defamation, and that Dorland's repeated communications with American Short Fiction and the Boston Book
Festival constituted intentional interference with Larson's business relationships. Larson also sought a declaration that she
owns the copyright to The Kindest and that the letter in the short story does not infringe Dorland's copyright. Dorland
counterclaimed for copyright infringement, claiming that Larson's use of Dorland's letter was a violation of intellectual
property law.

Pending before the court is Dorland's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 180] and Larson's Cross-Motion for
Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 187]. Both parties seek rulings on each of the three legal issues: copyright infringement,
defamation, and intentional interference with business relationships. For the following reasons, the court rules in Larson's
favor and against Dorland on the copyright claims and in Dorland's favor and against Larson on the defamation and
intentional interference claims.

I. Standard of Review

Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate when ""the movant shows that
there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P.
56(a). A fact is material when, under the governing substantive law, it could affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v.
Liberty Lobby, Inc. . 477 U.S. 242 , 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) ; Baker v. St. Paul Travelers Ins. . 670 F.3d
119 , 125 (1st Cir. 2012). A dispute is genuine if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving partyAnderson
477 U.S. at 248 , 106 S.Ct. 2505 .

The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact.Celotex
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 , 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . This burden can be satisfied in two ways: (1)
by submitting affirmative evidence that negates an essential element of the non-moving party's claim or (2) by demonstrating
that the non-moving party failed to establish an essential element of its claim. Id. at 331, 106 S.Ct. 2548 .

Once the moving party establishes the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact, the burden shifts to the non-
moving party to set forth facts demonstrating that a genuine dispute of material fact remains. Id. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548 . The
non-moving party cannot oppose a properly supported summary judgment motion by ""rest[ing on] mere allegation[s] or
denials of [the] pleading[s]."" Anderson , 477 U.S. at 256 , 106 S.Ct. 2505 . Rather, the non-moving party must ""go beyond
the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by 'the depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,’ designate
‘specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial."" Celotex , 477 U.S. at 324 , 106 S.Ct. 2548 (quoting Fed. R.
Civ. P. 56(e)). Disputes over facts ""that are irrelevant or unnecessary"" will not preclude summary judgment. Anderson , 477
U.S. at 248 , 106 S.Ct. 2505 .

When reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the court must take all properly supported evidence in the light most


--- Page 2 ---
favorable to the non-movant and draw all reasonable inferences in the non-movant's favor. Griggs-Ryan v. Smith , 904 F.2d
112 , 115 (1st Cir. 1990). ""Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences
from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, [when] he [or she] is ruling on a motion for summary judgment.""
Anderson , 477 U.S. at 255 , 106

[693 F.Supp.3d 69]

S.Ct. 2505. However, ""[e]ven in cases where elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue, summary judgment may
be appropriate if the nonmoving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported
speculation."" Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. , 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).

The filing of cross motions does not alter these general standards; rather the court reviews each party's motion
independently, viewing the facts and drawing inferences as required by the applicable standard, and determines, for each
party, the appropriate ruling. See Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co. , 100 F.3d 228 , 230 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that
cross-motions for summary judgment do not ""alter the basic Rule 56 standard"" but rather require the court ""to determine
whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not disputed"").

Il. Factual Background
A. Dorland Documents Her Kidney Donation on Facebook

In 2015, Dorland started a kidney donation chain by becoming a living kidney donor to an undesignated recipient.
Dorland Resp. to Larson Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Dorland Resp. SUMF) 4 3 [Doc. No. 195]. Prior to her
surgery, Dorland invited people she thought would be interested in, or supportive of, her decision to a private Facebook
group she created. Id. at § 4; Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. B [Doc. No. 181-2]. One of these invitees was Sonya Larson. Dorland
Resp. SUMF {6 [Doc. No. 195]. On July 7, 2015, shortly after her surgery, Dorland shared with the Facebook group her
letter to the final member of the kidney donation chain. Id. at § 13; Larson Resp. to Dorland Statement of Undisputed
Material Facts (Larson Resp. SUMF) ¥ 3 [Doc. No. 197]; Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. C (Dorland Letter) [Doc. 181-3]. In the
caption to her Facebook post, Dorland wrote: ""For those who are interested, I'm happy to share a letter here that |
composed to our Portland recipient . . . which got shared widely around the UCLA transplant team."" Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. C
Doc. No. 181-3].

B. Larson Reads Dorland's Letter and Writes a Short Story , The Kindest

Larson saw and read the Dorland Letter when it was posted on Facebook. Dorland Resp. SUMF § 19 [Doc. No. 195];
Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 1 (Larson Affidavit) § 6 [Doc. No. 189-1]; Larson Resp. SUMF § 4,6 [Doc. No. 197]. Shortly thereafter,
Larson began drafting a short story. Larson Resp. SUMF 4 5 [Doc. No. 197]. In The Kindest , Chuntao, a Chinese-American
woman, requires a kidney transplant after crashing her car into a tree while driving drunk. Larson Mem. SJ, Appendices |-V
(various versions of The Kindest ) [Doc. Nos. 193-1-5]. Chuntao miraculously receives a kidney from an anonymous living
donor. Id. As Chuntao is recovering from her surgery and accident, she receives a handwritten letter from the donor, Rose.
Id. The letter reveals some of Rose's personal history, and her desire to meet Chuntao. Id. Chuntao's husband, Bao, is
hrilled and honored to invite Rose to their home. Id. Chuntao, however, has deeply conflicting feelings about meeting Rose
and about the letter itself. Id. These negative feelings intensify throughout the story, as Chuntao's resentment and contempt
or Rose become increasingly evident. Id. (When Chuntao learns Rose is coming to her home: ""I wanted to be sick, to hide
under the table."" When Rose arrives, Chuntao asks Bao: ""She's the kindest bitch on the planet?"" Later, Chuntao's internal
monologue: ""What is this, this white woman,

693 F.Supp.3d 70]
crying on my couch? Crying to me. | felt bad for her, but | also wanted to slap her."").

Dorland's kidney donation and the letter Dorland posted to Facebook both served, at least partially, as Larson's
inspiration for The Kindest . Larson Resp. SUMF 6 [Doc. No. 197]; Dorland Resp. SUMF 19 [Doc. No. 195]. In a text
message to a friend, Larson stated that the story ""literally has sentences that | verbatim grabbed from Dawn's letter on
Facebook. I've tried to change it but | can't seem to. That letter was just too damn good."" Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. RR (Larson
Deposition) [Doc. No. 182-18]; Id. , Ex. J (Larson Text) [Doc. No. 181-10]. In other messages shared with friends and fellow
writers, Larson expressed that her source of ""inspiration"" was not limited to Dorland's kidney donation and letter but included
Dorland herself. Id. , Ex. R [Doc. No. 181-18];Id. , Ex. UU [Doc. No. 182-21] (text to Whitney Sharer);Id. , Ex. RR 49:18-24
(Larson Deposition) [Doc. No. 182-18] (confirming that ""the kidney donor was named Dawn in [the first draft of] your story"").

C. Larson Submits The Kindest for Publication and Audio Recording

In late 2015, Larson submitted a version of The Kindest to Plympton, a ""literary studio"" that helps authors sublicense
their work to other audio recording studios. Larson Resp. SUMF 4 17 [Doc. No. 197]; Larson Second Amended Complaint
(Amended Complaint) § 27 [Doc. No. 91]. Several lines of the Dorland Letter appear verbatim, or nearly verbatim in the
version of the letter that appears in this iteration of the story. Dorland Letter [Doc. No. 181-3]; Larson Mem. SJ, Appendix |
[Doc. No. 193-1]. 4

Plympton was successful in sublicensing The Kindest to Audible, which agreed in late 2015 to publish The Kindest as
an audiobook. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. H [Doc. No. 181-8]. In February 2016, Larson signed a contract allowing Plympton to


--- Page 3 ---
sublicense the story for audiobook recording purposes. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 9 (Plympton Contract) [Doc. No. 189-9].
Audible, through its subsidiary Brilliance Audio, published a recorded version of The Kindest online on August 3, 2016.
Larson Amended Complaint § 30 [Doc. No. 91]; Larson Resp. SUMF 4 11 [Doc. No. 197].

D. Dorland Discovers Larson Is Writing a Kidney Story

In June 2016, Larson read an excerpt of The Kindest at a reading at a Boston bookstore. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. RR
51:3-17 (Larson Deposition) [Doc. No. 182-18]. Subsequently, Dorland emailed Larson that she had heard that Larson was
working on a short story about kidney donation and asked to read it. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. N (Dorland-Larson Email Chain)
[Doc. No. 181-14]; Larson Amended Complaint § 21-22 [Doc. No. 91]. Larson wrote that she was working on a story on
kidney donation ""partially inspired by how [her] own imagination took off after learning of [Dorland's] own tremendous
donation."" Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. N (Dorland-Larson Email Chain) [Doc. No. 181-14]. Larson also told Dorland that she
""d[id]n't feel quite ready to show the full thing to people,"" but that ""[she]'d be happy to send it

[693 F.Supp.3d 71]
once it's finished."" Id. ; Larson Resp. SUMF § 12 [Doc. No. 197].

E.Larson Attempts to Change the Letter in the Audiobook Version of The Kindest

A few days after that email exchange, and a day after Audible published the first version of the audio recording, Larson
contacted Plympton and requested that the story be re-recorded because the letter in The Kindest ""includes a couple
sentences that I'd excerpted from a real-life letter,"" and ""for ethical reasons | am uncomfortable keeping those lines in.""
Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. O [Doc. No. 181-15]; Larson Resp. SUMF 10 [Doc. No. 197]. Larson then sent the company a
revised iteration of The Kindest , including a new letter in which much less of Dorland's original letter appears, although the
letter's structure and organization remained similar. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. S [Doc. No. 181-19]. That re-recorded version of
the story was published as an audiobook on Audible.com in October 2016. Dorland Resp. SUMF § 22 [Doc. No. 195].
However, the original audiobook version of The Kindest —including the unedited version of the letter-—remained publicly
available for purchase online. Larson Resp. SUMF 4 11 [Doc. No. 197]; Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. FF [Doc. No. 182-6].

F. American Short Fiction Publishes a Revised Version of The Kindest

In the summer of 2017, Larson submitted her revised version of The Kindest —including the edited version of the letter
—to American Short Fiction (""ASF""), where the story was accepted for print publication. Larson Resp. SUMF 13 [Doc. No.
197]; Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. T (Markovits Email) [Doc. No. 181-20]. That summer, ASF included The Kindest in a printbound
collection of short stories. Larson Resp. SUMF § 13 [Doc. No. 197]. A year later, in May 2018, ASF released an online
version of The Kindest . Id. at § 14; Dorland Resp. SUMF 22 [Doc. No. 195].

G. Larson Wins the Boston Book Festival's One City/One Story Competition

In May 2018, the Boston Book Festival (""BBF"") informed Larson that The Kindest had won the One City/One Story
(1C1S) competition. Larson Amended Complaint § 35 [Doc. No. 91]. Larson and BBF executed an agreement allowing BBF
to use the story in 101S-related events, which would have included distributing thousands of copies of the story around the
greater Boston area in October 2018. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 16 [Doc. No. 190-6]; Amended Compl. 4 35 [Doc. No. 91]. BBF's
contract with Larson did not require BBF to pay Larson for the use of the story, or otherwise offer compensation for 1C1S-
related activities. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 16 [Doc. No. 190-6].

H. Dorland Contacts American Short Fiction , the Boston Book Festival , and Others , and Registers the Copyright
for her Letter

In early June 2018, Dorland read the online version of The Kindest released by ASF. Dorland Resp. SUMF 23 [Doc.
No. 195]; Larson Resp. SUMF § 15 [Doc. No. 197]. Dorland recognized ""similarities"" between her Facebook letter and the
letter in the story. Dorland Resp. SUMF 24 [Doc. No. 195]; Larson Resp. SUMF 4 19 [Doc. No. 197]; Larson Mem. SJ, Ex.
12 [Doc. No. 190-2]. On June 4, 2018, Dorland contacted Rebecca Markovits, the Co-Editor of ASF. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. Z
[Doc. No. 181-26]. In an email bearing the heading ""Plagiarism in ' The Kindest ,'"" Dorland wrote that Larson had been privy
to information related to Dorland's kidney donation, had ""acknowledged that the short story she was working on was indeed
informed by [Dorland's] gesture,"" and had

[693 F.Supp.3d 72]

published the story with ASF ""without ever acknowledging"" Dorland. Id. In bold letters, Dorland wrote, ""BUT HERE'S THE
PROBLEM: My friend's kidney story, ' The Kindest ,’ includes a letter from a donor to her recipient. | believe that the letter in
Sonya's story plagiarizes the letter that | wrote to the final recipient in my short kidney chain, a letter to which Sonya had

access ...."" Id. Dorland stated that she would ""forward [her] own kidney letter as a separate email attachment for [ASF's]
comparison"" to see ""if [ASF] agree[d] that the letter in Sonya's story bears a problematic resemblance to the one that |
composed . . . ."" Id. Dorland then outlined a number of ""remedies [she] would find acceptable,"" including pulling the article,

adding an acknowledgement of Dorland's own work, and/or allowing Dorland to write a piece for ASF on ""ethical issues
germane to all writers."" Id.

Dorland also deduced from Larson's personal webpage that Larson had won 1C1S. Dorland Resp. SUMF 33 [Doc.


--- Page 4 ---
No. 195]. On June 7, 2018, Dorland repeated her plagiarism charge to BBF, again offering to provide her own kidney letter
for comparison. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. BB [Doc. No. 182-2].

Dorland also contacted other parties besides ASF and BBF about The Kindest and Larson. 2 Dorland Mem. Su, Ex II
[Doc. No. 182-9] (email to Dear Sugars podcast); Id. , Ex. JJ [Doc. 182-10] (Twitter direct message to Kat Rosenfield)jd. ,
Ex. Y [Doc. 181-25] (email to Samantha Shea); Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 18 [Doc. 190-8] (email to Michael Collier).

On June 7, 2018, Dorland emailed the Breadloaf Writer's Conference (""Breadloaf""), a writing program to which Larson
had won a fellowship in 2017. Dorland Resp. SUMF § 37 [Doc. No. 195]; Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. CC [Doc. No. 182-3]. In the
email, Dorland inquired whether a 2017 tuition fellow—Dorland did not specifically name Larson—had applied using The
Kindest as part of her portfolio. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. CC [Doc. No. 182-3]. Dorland then stated that The Kindest included a
letter that had plagiarized Dorland's original work. Id.

On June 10, 2018, Dorland registered the copyright for her Facebook letter. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 7 [Doc. No. 189-7].
The copyrighted letter replaced the caption from the Facebook post with the words: ""Real Letter."" Id.

1. ASF Pulls The Kindest from Online Publication and Larson Re-writes the Letter in The Kindest at BBF's Request

After receiving Dorland's email, Norah Piehl, Deputy Director of BBF, promptly contacted Larson and informed her of
Dorland's plagiarism claims. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 19 [Doc. No. 190-9]. Larson told Piehl that Larson ""remember[ed] that
letter, and jotted down phrases that [she] thought were compelling, though in the end [she] constructed the fictional letter to
suit the character of Rose."" Id. Piehl asked Larson to ""consider the possibility [of making changes to the story] based on
what [BBF] hear[s] from [its] lawyer about what constitutes the threshold for plagiarism."" Id.

A day later, Pieh! emailed Larson stating that BBF's lawyer ""suggest[ed] that Dawn may have a valid claim""; in the
interest of avoiding litigation, Piehl requested that Larson ""completely redraft the letter to avoid any resemblance in

[693 F.Supp.3d 73]

structure or language to the original; our lawyer particularly said that paraphrases (such as the introductory paragraph of
each letter) would need to be avoided."" Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. DD [Doc. No. 182-4]. Larson agreed to the re-write. Id. On or
around June 13, 2018, Larson altered the structure of the letter in The Kindest and removed almost all of the language that
also appeared in the Dorland Letter. Larson Mem. SJ, Appendix V [Doc. No. 193-5].

On June 19, 2018, ASF Co-Editor Rebecca Markovits emailed Dorland that ""' The Kindest' is now no longer up on
[ASF's] website,"" and that Markovits ""hope[d] this help[ed] [Dorland] find some resolution and closure to your natural
concerns."" Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 12 [Doc. No. 190-2]. In a separate email thread with Markovits, Larson consented to the
""sunset{[ting]"" of her piece on ASF's online platform; there is no evidence that The Kindest was removed from print
circulation. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. EE [Doc. No. 182-5]. Larson still received the full $300 due to her under the ASF contract.
Dorland Resp. SUMF § 22 [Doc. No. 195]; Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 11 (ASF Contract) [Doc. No. 190-1].

J .Dorland Seeks Further Relief from BBF and Contacts the Boston Globe

After Larson made the revisions requested by BBF, Dorland continued to contact BBF regarding The Kindest and
Larson. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 20 [Doc. No. 190-10]. On June 18, 2018, Dorland wrote to Piehl to express her dismay that
BBF was moving forward with printing the revised version of The Kindest . Id. Dorland stated that ""| wouldn't have been at all
surprised if BBF had found it repugnant to grant a writer who committed plagiarism such a wonderful platform. At the very
least, with the legal issue neutralized, | would have expected the organization to acknowledge the remedies it took in order
to proceed with the story."" Id. At Dorland's request, Piehl invited Dorland to propose an acknowledgment, Larson Mem. SJ,
Ex. 21 [Doc. No. 191-1], and Dorland suggested one which included the lines: ""A section of the story was substantially
revised because it bore a clear resemblance to the unpublished work and service of the writer Dawn Dorland, a living kidney
donor. The Boston Book Festival, 1C1S, and the author Sonya Larson express their sincere regrets."" Larson Mem. SJ, Ex.
22 [Doc. No. 191-2]. Dorland also asserted that The Kindest contained factual inaccuracies with respect to the process of
kidney donation and would ""discourage"" organ donation. Id.

Sometime in mid-June 2018, Dorland also reached out to Graham Ambrose, a reporter at the Boston Globe, to discuss
her dispute with Larson. Dorland Resp. SUMF 4 51 [Doc. No. 195].

K . Dorland's Attorney Sends Cease and Desist Letter to BBF and Dorland Writes to Larson's Employer

On July 3, 2018, Dorland's California lawyer, Jeffrey Cohen, wrote to BBF, charging that Larson had committed
copyright infringement in The Kindest and demanding that BBF cease ""printing, copying, distribution, or other activities
related to ' The Kindest ' until this matter has been resolved."" Dorland Resp. SUMF 4 47 [Doc. No. 195]; Larson Mem. SJ,
Ex. 24 [Doc. No. 191-4]. Cohen demanded that BBF provide ""an advance copy of the purportedly revised 'non-infringing'
version of ' The Kindest ,'"" and threatened legal action if the draft was not satisfactory, writing:

such action, if necessary, would no longer be for attribution, but will demand the full measure of penalties for
statutory copyright infringement under 17

[693 F.Supp.3d 74]


--- Page 5 ---
U.S.C. § 504(c), which as you likely are aware, could be as high as $150,000 under facts as those presented
herein wherein BBF has admitted infringement and willfully proceeds in complete and intentional disregard of our
client's rights . .. . The shortness, and quite frankly the rudeness of your prior response to our client will not be
considered favorably by the court.

Id.

On July 7, 2018, Dorland wrote to Eve Bridburg, the head of Larson's then-employer, GrubStreet, to file ""a complaint of
professional misconduct"" against Larson. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 23 [Doc. No. 191-3]. In her email, Dorland raised her ""claim
that Sonya plagiarized my writing in her short story, The Kindest ,"" complained that Larson had ""physical[ly] ghost[ed]""
Dorland at a conference, and called for Larson to be ""suspended with or without pay.” Id.

BBF's attorney sent Cohen a copy of the revised version of The Kindest on July 10, 2018. Dorland Resp. SUMF 49
[Doc. No. 195]. Dorland's attorneys responded that Dorland was dissatisfied with the revisions. Larson Mem. Su, Ex. 25 49
(Gregorio Aff.) [Doc. No. 191-5]. On or about July 23, Attorney Michael Hanna, who worked with Attorney Cohen, told James
Gregorio, counsel for Larson, that Dorland wanted acknowledgment of her contribution to the story with her name cited,
information about how to donate a kidney, and $5,000. Id. at § 11; Dorland Resp. SUMF 9 53-55 [Doc. No. 195].

Gregorio learned on July 23 that Dorland had contacted the Boston Globe. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 25 § 10 (Gregorio Aff.)
[Doc. No. 191-5]. The following day, Gregorio called Hanna to inform him that ""there was no point discussing settlement if
there was going to be a negative article in the [Boston] Globe."" Id. at § 11; Dorland Resp. SUMF 4 55 [Doc. No. 195]. Hanna
responded, ""If we get everything we want, we will give our full effort to kill the story."" Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 25 4 11 (Gregorio

On July 26, 2018, The Boston Globe ran Ambrose's article, titled ""Inspiration or plagiarism? Writing hackles raised in
Boston dispute."" Larson Mem. Su, Ex. 30 [Doc. No. 191-10]. The article contained quotes from the Dorland Letter, the 2017
version of The Kindest Letter, and the 2016 version of The Kindest Letter. Id. Both Dorland and Larson are quoted in the
article. Id. None of the quotes attributed to Dorland call Larson a ""plagiarist"" or otherwise use the term ""plagiarism."" Id.

M. BBF Prints The Kindest but Cancels 1C1S

On August 6, 2018, BBF printed 30,000 copies of the revised version of The Kindest . Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. GG [Doc.
No. 182-7]; Dorland Resp. SUMF § 58 [Doc. No. 195]. On August 13, 2018, BBF's Executive Director, Deborah Porter,
informed Larson that 1C1S was being cancelled as a result of the ongoing dispute with Dorland. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. GG
[Doc. No. 182-7]. Porter suggested that Larson could be liable for BBF's costs in printing The Kindest (approximately
$10,000), but ultimately Larson was not required to compensate BBF for its costs. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. HH [Doc. No. 182-
8].

N. The Boston Globe Publishes a Second Article

After 1C1S was cancelled, the Boston Globe ran a second story on Larson and Dorland's dispute. Larson Mem. Su, Ex.
33 [Doc. No. 192-3]. In that piece, the Boston Globe included direct quotes from several versions of the letter, including the
2016 Letter from the first Audible recording. Id.

O. Further Events After the Lawsuit Was Filed

After discovery had commenced in this action, Dorland contacted a writer at The New York Times to further publicize
her dispute with Larson. Dorland. Resp. SUMF 4 65 [Doc. No. 195]. The New York Times Magazine published a long-form
article titled, ""Who is the Bad Art Friend?"" on October 10, 2021. Id. The article included Larson's early texts that had come
out during discovery, as well as quotes from various versions of The Kindest and interviews with both women. Larson Mem.
SJ, Ex. 36 [Doc. No. 192-6].

Larson remained employed at Grubstreet for three years after Dorland first reached out to the organization but was
terminated after the New York Times story was published. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. G [Doc. No. 194-7] (GrubStreet Statement,
Oct. 29, 2021, attributing change in organization's employment decisions to ""certain documents relating to this] lawsuit that
recently came to light"").

Ill. Procedural Background
A. Larson's Complaint
Larson initiated this action on January 30, 2019. Compl. [Doc. No. 1]. Larson's operative Second Amended Complaint
[Doc. No. 91] brings claims against Dorland for Intentional Interference with Larson's Advantageous Business Relationship

with ASF (Count |), Intentional Interference with Larson's Advantageous Business Relationship with BBF (Count II),
Defamation (Count VII), and seeks a Declaratory Judgment (Count VIII) of noninfringement. 2

B. Dorland's Counterclaims

Dorland's Answer to Second Amended Complaint and Restated Counterclaim [Doc. No. 96] asserts claims against
Larson for Copyright Infringement (Count |), Declaratory Relief (Count II), and Injunctive Relief under Copyright Law (Count
II). 4

C. Motions Before the Court

Dorland's pending Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 180] requests entry of judgment on her remaining Counts
against Larson, as well as on Larson's remaining Counts against Dorland. Larson's pending Cross Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 187] requests entry of judgment in her favor on Counts |, Il, and VII of her Second Amended
Complaint, and Counts | and II of Dorland's Counterclaim.

IV. Discussion
A. Copyright Infringement

Dorland asserts that ""the Brilliance Audio version, the ASF Web Version, the hard copy version published by ASF, any
and all versions published by Audible.com, the version printed by the BBF, the version published by Welcome to the
Neighborhood, and any other versions of The Kindest "" infringe upon Dorland's copyright in her 2015 Letter. Dorland
Counterclaim

[693 F.Supp.3d 76]

4176 [Doc. No. 96]. £Larson claims that she owns the copyright to The Kindest , and that the 2018 Letter does not infringe
on Dorland's letter because it is not substantially similar to the Dorland Letter. Larson Mem. SJ 39 [Doc. No. 189]. She
further asserts that all versions of the letter in The Kindest are protected by the fair use defense. Id. at 24.

1. Substantially Similar

In order to prove copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show ""(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of
constituent elements of the work that are original."" Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. 340, 361,111 S.Ct.
1282 , 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) . The second prong is a two-part inquiry: first, the plaintiff must show that the defendant
actually copied the original work. Second, the plaintiff must show that ""the copying of the copyrighted material was so
extensive that it rendered the infringing and copyrighted works ‘substantially similar."" Segrets, Inc. v. Gillman Knitwear Co.
207 F.3d 56 , 60 (1st Cir. 2000). The parties do not dispute that Dorland owns the copyright to her 2015 Letter, or that
Larson actually copied that letter. Dorland Resp. SUMF § 19, 48 [Doc. No. 195]; Larson Resp. SUMF § 6, 28 [Doc. No.
197]. The only remaining question as to infringement is that of substantial similarity between the Dorland Letter and each of

the three versions of

[693 F.Supp.3d 77]

Because the three versions of The Kindest Letter resemble the Dorland Letter to different degrees,
each of the three versions in turn. Z

The 2016 Brilliance Audio Letter.2 As Larson concedes, the undisputed evidence mandates a co
2016 Letter is substantially similar to the Dorland Letter. The Dorland Letter is approximately 381 words
SJ, Ex. C [Doc. No. 181-3]; of those 381 words, the 2016 Letter copies verbatim approximately 100, and

he court considers

nclusion that the
jong, Dorland Mem.
closely

paraphrases approximately 50 more, Larson Mem. SJ, Appendix | [Doc. No. 193-1]. Many of these verbatim or near-

verbatim lines gave the Dorland Letter its particular character, including: ""My gift . . . trails no strings""; ""I

focused/channeled]

[a majority of] my [mental] energ[y/ies] into imagining and celebrating you""; ""| accept any level of involvement, . . . even if it is

none""; ""To me the suffering of strangers is just as real""; and ""| [wasn't given/didn't have] the opportunity

‘0 form secure

attachments with my family of origin."" Id. The 2016 Letter also follows an identical structure to the Dorland Letter: a


--- Page 7 ---
paragraph introducing the donor, including information on race, age, and gender; a paragraph explaining how the donor
discovered the need for kidney donation; a paragraph explaining the donor's traumatic childhood; a paragraph expressing
the donor's focus on the future recipient; a paragraph wishing the recipient health and happiness; and a concluding
paragraph expressing a desire to meet. Id. Based on the documents before the court, the 2016 Letter took ""material of
substance and value"" from the Dorland Letter in such a quantity and in such a manner that the points of similarity outweigh
the points of dissimilarity. See Segrets, Inc. . 207 F.3d at 62 , 66.

The 2017 American Short Fiction Letter. The 2017 Letter does not compel either a finding of substantial similarity or
a finding of no infringement. The 2017 Letter contains less verbatim language than the 2016 Letter. Larson Mem. SJ,
Appendix III [Doc. No. 193-3]. But it still closely paraphrases the Dorland Letter, including the notable line ""imagining and
celebrating you,"" where ""celebrating"" has been altered to ""rejoicing in."" Id. The 2017 Letter also retains the identical
organizational structure of the Dorland Letter. Id. However, the similarities between the 2017 Letter and the Dorland Letter
are not so striking that no reasonable juror could conclude that the two letters are meaningfully different. Id.

The 2018 Boston Book Festival Letter. The 2018 Letter is very different from the 2016 Letter. Unlike the 2016 Letter,
he 2018 Letter contains almost no verbatim or closely paraphrased language from the Dorland Letter: the key phrases

693 F.Supp.3d 78]

identified above are all entirely absent from the 2018 Letter. Larson Mem. SJ, Appendix V [Doc. No. 193-5]. The
organization and tone of the 2018 Letter are also notably different from the Dorland Letter: Among other changes, the 2018
Letter contains a new introductory paragraph and a substantially revised concluding paragraph. Id. The 2018 Letter does
incorporate the one-word signature line, ""Kindly,"" that was also present in the Dorland Letter (but absent in the 2016 and
2017 Letters). Id. In sum, the ""points of dissimilarity"" between the substantially revised 2018 Letter and the Dorland Letter
exceed any remaining points of similarity; further, those remaining similarities are either ""of minimal importance"" to the
Dorland Letter or are not copyrightable expressions (e.g., the general concept of a letter written to an organ recipient, and
he one-word signature line). See Segrets, Inc. . 207 F.3d at 66 . As a result, the court finds that the 2018 Letter is not
substantially similar to the Dorland Letter, and therefore does not infringe upon the Dorland Letter.

2. Fair Use Defense

Larson contends that, even if the Larson Letters are found to be substantially similar to the Dorland Letter, any
infringement constituted permissible fair use. The fair use defense is an affirmative defense to copyright infringement; as
such, Larson bears the burden of proof at summary judgment.

""The fair use doctrine ‘permits courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle
the very creativity which that law is designed to foster.’ "" Andy Warhol Found. for the Visual Arts. Inc. v. Goldsmith , 598 U.S.
508 , 143 S. Ct. 1258 1274, 215 L.Ed.2d 473 (2023) (quoting Stewart v. Abend , 495 U.S. 207 , 236,110 S.Ct. 1750 , 109
L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) ). The fair-use doctrine is a mixed question of law and fact.Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. , 593 U.S. 1,
141 S. Ct. 1183 1199, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021) . ""The task [of applying the fair use doctrine] is not to be simplified with
bright-line rules, for the statute, like the doctrine it recognizes, calls for case-by-case analysis."" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose
Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569, 577,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) . The Copyright Act directs the court to determine
whether use of the work ""for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching . . . scholarship, or research"" is
non-infringing fair use by considering factors including: ""(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such
use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount
and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the
potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. §§ 107(1)-(4). The factors are to be considered together,
not ""treated in isolation, one from another."" Campbell , 510 U.S. at 578 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 .

a. Character of the Use

The first factor of the fair use defense requires the court to consider ""whether the new work merely 'supersede[s] the
objects' of the original creation . . . ('supplanting' the original), or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or a
different character."" Campbell , 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Put another way, the first factor contemplates ""whether
and to what extent the new work is ‘transformative.’ "" Id.

As a preliminary matter, the parties disagree upon the proper frame of reference for the transformative use inquiry.
Larson would have the court focus on

[693 F.Supp.3d 79]

whether The Kindest , taken in its entirety as a short story, serves a distinct purpose to Dorland's original Facebook post.
Larson Mem. SJ 25-26 [Doc. No. 189]. Dorland argues that the letter as it exists within The Kindest is put to the exact same
use as Dorland's original letter: ""that is, a personal letter from the organ donor to an organ recipient, for the purpose of
sharing the donor's motivations and desire to connect in the shared experience with the recipient of the organ."" Dorland
Mem. SJ 14 [Doc. No. 184].

The law is on Larson's side. In Andy Warhol Foundation , the Supreme Court took its analysis down to the very end of
the contextual chain, starting with the medium of the work (""portraits""), but ending with the broader framework in which the
work ultimately appeared (""magazine stories about Prince""). Andy Warhol Found. . 143 S. Ct. at 1273 . Applying the Andy
Warhol Foundation framework to the facts of this case, the short story itself is the broader framework in which the allegedly



--- Page 8 ---
infringing material—the letter—appears. Thus, the court must conduct its analysis in line with that final contextual reference
point.

""The same copying may be fair when used for one purpose but not another."" Id. at 1277. Thus, the transformative use
inquiry ""is a matter of degree, and the degree of difference must be weighed against other considerations, like
commercialism. Although new expression may be relevant to whether a copying use has a sufficiently distinct purpose or
character, it is not, without more, dispositive of the first factor."" Id. at 1273.

""[A]n overbroad concept of transformative use, one that includes any further purpose, or any different character, would
narrow the copyright owner's exclusive right to create derivative works."" Id. at 1275. To distinguish itself from a derivative
use, then, a transformative use must"" 'serve a manifestly different purpose from the [work] itself."" Id. at 1274. In other
words, where the allegedly infringing work exists ""orthogonallly]"" to the original, the first factor is satisfied. Id. at 1281. That is
precisely the case here.

The court begins with the Dorland Letter's purpose. As Dorland explains, its purpose was to inform the kidney recipient
at the end of the chain, as well as Dorland's friends and family members, about her motivations for becoming a living kidney
donor, and to express her emotions surrounding her own donation and her good wishes for the recipient. Dorland Mem. SJ,
Ex. PP 128-138 (Dorland Depo.) [Doc. No. 182-16]. More broadly, the Dorland Letter served as an update in her broader
social media documentation of her kidney donation, which she hoped would raise awareness about living kidney donation.
See id., Exs. A, B [Doc Nos. 181-1; 181-2].

Larson contends that The Kindest made transformative use of the Dorland Letter by ""using the letter in ‘The Kindest ' to
introduce the character, Rose[,] to the character, Chuntao"" in a ""fictitious"" story. Larson Mem. SJ 25-26 [Doc. No. 189]. The
letter was used not just to introduce Rose, but to starkly contrast an altruistic kidney donor's view of her own actions with the
view a recipient may have of the same actions. Id. , Appendices I-V [Doc Nos. 193-1-5]. The story, read in its entirety, does
not mirror the tone of Dorland's letter, nor does the story's tone seek to build on Dorland's thoughts, emotions, and feelings
about altruistic kidney donation. Id. ; Id. , Ex. 22 [Doc. No. 191-2] (Dorland description offhe Kindest as ""mock[ing] the
motivations of an altruistic donor""). Moreover, as Dorland herself pointed out to BBF, the story does not seek to provide

[693 F.Supp.3d 80]

factually accurate information about the process of living kidney donation. Id. , Ex. 22 [Doc. No. 191-2]. In short, these two
pieces are at opposite ends of the spectrum of writing about kidney donation.

Indeed, it would be difficult to read The Kindest as anything other than a criticism of an altruistic donor's choice to reach
out to a kidney recipient. Chuntao, The Kindest 's narrator, seems to harbor resentment and pity—bordering on contempt—
for her donor's act of charity. The undisputed evidence regarding the context of Larson's writing and drafting process makes
it clear that this criticism was Larson's focus in The Kindest : Larson's conversations with friends and fellow writers
underscore the critical attitude she took towards Dorland's public discussion of her kidney donation, and towards Dorland
herself. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. R [Doc. No. 181-18]; Id. , Ex. UU [Doc. No. 182-21].

This context is important, because criticism (and its close cousin, parody 2) do not ""supersede the objects of, or
supplant"" an original work in the same way that more flattering follow-on works might do. See Andy Warhol Found. . 143 S.
Ct. at 1274 . That is because ""the unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of
their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market."" Campbell , 510 U.S. at 592 ,
114 S.Ct. 1164.

Relatedly, that an allegedly infringing work is critical of an original work is a strong indication that the two artists had
diverging motivations in creating their respective pieces, a fact that also weighs in favor of transformative use. See Nufiez v.
Caribbean Intern. News Corp. . 235 F.3d 18 (1st Cir. 2000) (""[W]hat is important here is that the plaintiffs’ photographs were
originally intended to appear in modeling portfolios, not in the newspaper; the former use, not the latter, motivated the
creation of the work.""). Larson used the short story as a medium for giving voice to her discomfort with the idea of a donor
publicizing their donation. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. UU (text to Shari Bowen) [Doc. No. 182-21]. That motivation could not be
further from Dorland's purpose in writing, posting, and sending the letter, which was to do exactly that which Larson
condemns in her story: to seek connection with her kidney recipient, and to seek recognition from a broader community.

Finally, while ""a finding that copying was not commercial in nature tips the scales in favor of fair use . . . the inverse is
not necessarily true."" Google , 141 S. Ct. at 1204 ; accord Andy Warhol Found. , 143 S. Ct. at 1276 (""The commercial nature
of the use is not dispositive.""). Here, as in Google , the court finds that the entirely orthogonal purpose of The Kindest
Letters as compared to the original Dorland Letter outweighs any potential unfairness from any commercial benefit Larson
received from The Kindest 's publication. See 141 S. Ct. at 1204 .

b. Nature of the Copyrighted Work
""The second statutory factor, 'the nature of the copyrighted work,’ 17 U.S.C.
[693 F.Supp.3d 81]
§ 107(2), requires us to consider two elements: (1) whether [the Dorland Letter is] factual or creative, and (2) whether [the

Dorland Letter] ha[s] previously been published."" Soc'y of Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Inc. v. Gregory , 689 F.3d 29, 61
(1st Cir. 2012) (internal citations omitted). The parties dispute both elements.



--- Page 9 ---
The first element concerns ""the extent to which it is a creative work enjoying broader copyright protection as opposed to
a factual work requiring broader dissemination."" Nufiez , 235 F.3d at 23 . Larson does not directly address this first element
but refers to the Dorland Letter as the ""factual letter."" Larson Amended Complaint 4 10 [Doc. No. 91]. Dorland maintains that
her letter contains key elements of creative expression. Dorland Mem. SJ 18-19 [Doc. No. 184]. The court finds that the
Dorland Letter lies somewhere in a middle ground: while it used creative language to express Dorland's ideas, emotions and
feelings, the Letter was not an artistic representation but rather a communication meant to convey factual information about
non-directed kidney donation and Dorland's own actions. ""Given the difficulty of characterizing the ‘nature’ "" of the Dorland
Letter, ""the impact of [its] creativity on the fair use finding is neutral."" See NUfez , 235 F.3d at 23 .

The second element derives from the copyright owner's "" 'right to control the first public distribution’ of [her] work,""
which ""implicates not only [her] personal interest in creative contro! but [her] property interest in exploitation of prepublication
rights, which are valuable in themselves and serve as a valuable adjunct to publicity and marketing."" Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. . 471 U.S. 539 , 555, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) . Larson argues that because
Dorland shared the letter with, among others, the UCLA transplant team, the kidney recipient, and a subset of her Facebook
followers, the Dorland Letter was published. Larson Mem. SJ 27-28 [Doc. No. 189]. Dorland argues that because she posted
the letter to a private Facebook group, it was not published. Dorland Mem. SJ 15 [Doc. No. 184].

Here, the court finds that the Dorland Letter was published for the purposes of the copyright inquiry. The First Circuit
has recognized that the Copyright Act does not necessarily require an author to publish a work in a traditional media format
(e.g., a newspaper or a book) for that author to have capitalized on their right of first publication. See NUfez , 235 F.3d at 24
(""Although these photographs had not before been published in a book or public portfolio, they were hardly confidential or
secret, as was the manuscript in Harper & Row prior to its serial publication.""). Such is the case with the Dorland letter.
Dozens of people viewed the letter on Facebook. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. C [Doc. No. 181-3]. Dorland herself reported that
she sent the letter to the transplant team at UCLA where it was read and ""shared widely,"" id. , without Dorland once raising
an objection to its circulation, or ""s[eeking] to control further dissemination during [its] limited distribution."" See Nufez . 235
F.3d at 24 . Elsewhere, Dorland encouraged the Facebook community more broadly to ""share"" her kidney post; although
that directive was not specific to her letter, her actions suggest that she was not intent on keeping it secret. Dorland Resp.
SUMF 14 [Doc. No. 195]. These facts indicate that the Dorland Letter was ""hardly confidential or secret,"" and may fairly be
treated as ""published"" under the law. See Nufiez . 235 F.3d at 24 .

c. Amount and Substantiality of Use
The third factor considers the amount and substantiality of the use of the copyrighted material as compared to the
[693 F.Supp.3d 82]

copyrighted material as whole. ""Both direct quotes and close paraphrases count as being 'used.'"" Wright v. Warner Books
Inc. , 953 F.2d 731 , 738 (2d Cir. 1991). The court also considers whether the infringing work ""is structured around the
quoted excerpts which serve as its dramatic focal points."" Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. , 471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 .
Contrary to Larson's arguments, Larson Mem. SJ 28 [Doc. No. 189], the court may not consider the proportion of
copyrighted material to uncopyrighted material used in the allegedly infringing work under this factor. Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. , 471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 (""[NJo plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his work
he did not pirate.""). Because Larson used different amounts of the Dorland Letter in the three versions of The Kindest Letter,
he court considers them separately.

The 2016 Letter. Larson copied more of the Dorland Letter than necessary in the 2016 Letter. Indeed, she copied so
much of the letter that she introduced inaccuracies into her own story, referencing a ""paired exchange"" when The Kindest
did not involve that medical procedure. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. RR 30:13-19 (Larson Depo.) [Doc. No. 182-18]. The 2016
Letter includes the verbatim portion of the Dorland Letter that discusses Dorland's childhood trauma—an aspect of Rose's
character that is never referenced again throughout the story. Id. at 30:19-26. Additionally, the 2016 Letter includes a near-
verbatim repetition of the line: ""| channeled my energy into imagining and celebrating YOU."" In The Kindest , this line is a
ocal point (""underscored three times"") that drives Chuntao's reaction to receiving the letter. Larson Mem. SJ, Appendix |
Doc. 193-1]. Therefore, as to the 2016 Letter, the third factor weighs against a finding of fair use.

The 2017 Letter. Viewed in the light most favorable to Dorland (the non-moving party), the 2017 Letter also borrows
more than necessary from the Dorland Letter. While Larson edited the letter to avoid most verbatim copying (such as the
""trails no strings"" language), the 2017 Letter still contains many ""close paraphrases"" and several key verbatim or near-
verbatim passages from the Dorland Letter. Like the 2016 Letter, the 2017 Letter contains a near-verbatim recitation of the
line: ""| channeled my mental energy into imagining and celebrating YOU."" Larson Mem. SJ, Appendix III [Doc. No. 193-3]. It
also contains the phrase ""paired exchange"" from the Dorland Letter, even though the kidney donation described in The
Kindest was not a ""paired exchange."" Id. The court finds that as to the 2017 Letter, the third factor weighs against a finding
of fair use.

The 2018 Letter. As noted above, the 2018 Letter contains no verbatim or closely paraphrased language from the
Dorland Letter except the one-word signature line, ""Kindly."" As to the 2018 Letter, this factor weighs in favor of a finding of
fair use.

d. Effect on Market Value of Original Work


--- Page 10 ---
The market-effects factor is the ""most important"" one. Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. , 471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. 2218
. It is concerned with whether an allegedly infringing work will lead to ""[economic] losses [that] normally conflict with a
copyright's basic objective: providing authors with exclusive rights that will spur creative expression."" Google LLC , 141 S.
Ct. at 1206 .

In this way, the fourth factor (like the first factor) asks whether the alleged infringer transformed the source
[693 F.Supp.3d 83]

material in such a way that demand for the new work can exist alongside demand for the original. Here, the answer to that
question is 'yes.' As discussed, The Kindest is highly critical of the subject matter in the Dorland Letter. And just as a new

parodic use may well ""suppress demand for the original by its critical effect"" without ""usurp[ing] demand by its substitutive

effect,"" see Campbell . 510 U.S. at 598 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 , a critical use may serve a similar role12

Ironically, Larson's short story has, if anything, increased demand for Dorland's original letter and her own perspective
on kidney donation. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 30 (Boston Globe article) [Doc. No. 191-10]; Id. , Ex. 36 (New York Times article)
[Doc. No. 192-6]; see Nufiez . 235 F.3d at 25 (fourth factor favored fair use where ""the only discernible effect of the
publication . . . was to increase demand for the [original]""). As Larson noted in her briefing, ""Dorland can still tell about her
donation, in whatever genre or medium she would like,"" Larson Mem. SJ 26 [Doc. No. 189]—and so she has. Larson Mem.
SJ, Ex. 30 [Doc. No. 191-10]; Id. , Ex. 36 [Doc. No. 192-6]. Therefore, the court finds that the fourth factor weighs in favor of
the fair use defense.

Finally, Dorland argues that Larson's ""bad faith"" personal comments about Dorland in group chats with friends and
other writers foreclose her invocation of the fair use defense. Dorland Mem. SJ 16-17 [Doc. No. 184]. The Supreme Court
and the First Circuit have expressed skepticism that ""bad faith has much relevance to the fair use analysis."" Monsarrat v.
Newman , 28 F.4th 314, 323 n.3 (1st Cir. 2022);Google LLC , 141 S. Ct. at 1204 (""As for bad faith, our decision in
Campbell expressed some skepticism about whether bad faith has any role in a fair use analysis. We find this skepticism
justifiable, as '[c]opyright is not a privilege reserved for the well-behaved' "" (internal citation omitted).). Even if bad faith were
significant, copyright law is not concerned with a person's generally good or bad character—but rather whether that person
obtained copyrighted material using ""egregious"" and inappropriate means. See Monsarrat . 28 F.4th at 323 n.3. Here,
Dorland voluntarily shared the letter with Larson (and, indeed, with many others). That Larson proceeded to privately ridicule
Dorland over the letter's contents may change Dorland's feelings about choosing to share personal information with Larson
—but it does not change Larson's entitlement to a legal defense.

In sum, because three of the four factors, including the ""most important"" fourth factor, weigh in favor of the defense, the
court finds that the at-issue versions of The Kindest are protected by fair use.

B. Defamation

In her Second Amended Complaint, Larson alleges that ""Dorland contacted the ASF, the BBF, GrubStreet, Bread Loaf,
the Boston Globe, Larson's writer's group, and in Dorland's own words, ‘other writing conferences of similar repute,’
spreading false and malicious claims of plagiarism against Larson."" Amended Complaint § 109 [Doc. No. 91]; Dorland Mem.
SJ, Ex.

[693 F.Supp.3d 84]

SS 220:11-13 [Doc. No. 182-19]. In response, Dorland asserts that her statements were true, or in the alternative, were non-
defamatory statements of opinion. Dorland Mem. SJ 22, 25 [Doc. No. 184].

To succeed on a claim of defamation under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must show: (1) that ""the defendant made a
statement, concerning the plaintiff, to a third party""; (2) that the statement was capable of damaging ""the plaintiff's reputation
in the community""; (3) that ""[t]he defendant was at fault in making the statement""; and (4) that ""[t]he statement either caused
the plaintiff economic loss . . . or is actionable without proof of economic loss."" Shay v. Walters , 702 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir.
2012) (cleaned up); see also Ravnikar v. Bogojaviensky , 438 Mass. 627 , 629, 782 N.E.2d 508 (2003) (same). 11 For several
reasons, Larson's defamation claim fails as to all contested communications.

First, Larson has failed to introduce any evidence of Dorland's specific communications with many of the individuals
and entities on Larson's extensive list of allegedly defamatory statements. Of note, Larson does not point to any
communications between Dorland and the Boston Globe outside of the two articles ultimately published by the Globe—and
Dorland does not explicitly accuse Larson of ""plagiarism"" or call her a ""plagiarist"" in either one. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 30
[Doc. No. 191-10]; Id. , Ex. 33 [Doc. No. 192-2]. Moreover, both articles include excerpts of the Dorland Letter and various
versions of The Kindest Letter, in order to highlight the relevant points of similarity. Id. Dorland's statements to the Globe, as
reflected in the two final articles, express her reaction to reading The Kindest and seeing language ""that bore striking
similarities to her own."" Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 30 [Doc. 191-10] (quoting from The Boston Globe); see Croce v. Sanders , 843
Fed. Appx. 710, 713 (6th Cir. 2021) (no defamation where defendant contacted a New York Times journalist after ""report[ing]
his [plagiarism] concerns to the respective journals"" where the material was published and receiving ""unsatisfactory""
responses). Therefore, Larson has failed to meet her burden on summary judgment that Dorland's allegations of plagiarism
as to the Boston Globe rise to the level of defamation.

Second, a statement of opinion cannot be defamatory ""where the speaker communicates the non-defamatory facts that


--- Page 11 ---
undergird his opinion."" Piccone v. Bartels , 785 F.3d 766 , 771 (1st Cir. 2015). That is exactly what Dorland did in her
communications with ASF, BBF, and literary agent Samantha Shea. 12 Dorland's email to Shea included the text of the letter
in the body of the email, as well as an extensive discussion of the reasons Dorland thought Larson may have copied
Dorland's original letter. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. Y [Doc. 181-25] (email to Samantha Shea). And in her emails to ASF and
BBF, Dorland stated that she had attached a copy of her 2015 Letter, inviting the recipients to see ""if [they] agree[d]"" with
Dorland's assessment that The Kindest plagiarized Dorland's writing. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. Z (ASF email) [Doc. No.181-26];
Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. BB (BBF email)

693 F.Supp.3d 85]

Doc. No. 182-2]. Given that Dorland provided the factual context, and the piece of writing she claimed was the source
material for Larson's alleged plagiarism, Dorland sufficiently supported her opinion with the relevant non-defamatory
information.

Dorland similarly provided additional information in her communications with the Dear Sugars podcast, the former
Breadloaf director Michael Collier, GrubStreet, and reporter Kat Rosenfield. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex Il (email to Dear Sugars
podcast) [Doc. No. 182-9]; Id. , Ex. JJ (Twitter DM to Kat Rosenfield) [Doc. 182-10]; Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 18 (email to former
Breadloaf director) [Doc. 190-8]; In each message, Dorland included links to one or both of the Boston Globe articles, which,
as discussed, provide context for the dispute as well as direct quotes from the Dorland Letter and various versions of The
Kindest Letters. See Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 30 [Doc. No. 191-10]; Id. , Ex. 33 [Doc. No. 192-2].

Third, truth is an absolute defense to defamation. Massachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n , 142
F.3d 26 , 42 (1st Cir. 1998). Under Massachusetts common law, statements that are ""substantially true,"" but which may
contain ""minor inaccurac[ies],"" are also considered non-defamatory. Reilly v. Associated Press , 59 Mass. App. Ct. 764,
770, 797 N.E.2d 1204 (2003) . The question is therefore whether Dorland's statements that Larson plagiarized her letter are
substantially true.

Black's Law Dictionary defines ""plagiarize"" as ""[t]o take phrases, sentences, or ideas from someone else's work and
use them in one's own work without attribution, as if they were one's own; to use the ideas and expressions of someone else
without giving due credit."" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Based on the undisputed facts, this is exactly what Larson
did in the 2016 Letter and at least arguably did in the 2017 Letter. 12 Many of Dorland's particularly unique lines, as well as
the overall structure of the letter, remain the same across these two letters.

But the court need not independently compare documents to reach this conclusion. Larson herself admitted that she
used Dorland's words in the original letter: in an email sent to an Audible representative, Larson stated that the letter in The
Kindest ""includes a couple of sentences that I'd excerpted from a real-life letter."" Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. O [Doc. No. 181-15].
Larson was more direct with her friends, texting: ""| feel nervous about sending [ The Kindest ] out b/c it literally has
sentences that | verbatim grabbed from Dawn's letter on FB."" Id. , Ex. RR 39:21-40:7 (Larson Depo.) [Doc. No. 182-18]:Id. ,
Ex. J (Larson Text) [Doc. No. 181-10]. It is also clear that some of these verbatim sentences are not remotely Larson's own
""ideas or expressions""; Larson admitted that even after publishing two versions of The Kindest including the phrase ""paired
exchange,"" she did not know what it meant, stating that ""th[e] phrase is from Dorland's letter."" Id. , Ex. RR 30:13-19 (Larson
Depo.) [Doc. No. 182-18].

[693 F.Supp.3d 86]

While Larson may not have credited Dorland's ""ideas and expressions"" because Larson wanted to take credit for artistic
aspects, as Dorland implies, it seems equally likely that Larson did not mention Dorland initially because of the disparaging
nature of the short story. And while Dorland may have communicated that she wanted credit for the ideas, it seems equally
likely that she was very upset at the criticism. Regardless, it is undisputed that Larson did not credit Dorland, which means
hat Larson's use of Dorland's ""ideas and expressions"" in the 2016 and 2017 Letters satisfies the definition of plagiarism.

Finally, Larson complains that Dorland's communication to Breadloaf was defamatory because it incorrectly implied that
Larson had used The Kindest in her 2017 Fellowship application when she had not done so. Larson Mem. SJ 23 [Doc. No.
189]. That misstates the nature of Dorland's communication with Breadloaf, which—while intrusive and unnecessary—never
asserted or implied that The Kindest had been included in the application materials. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. CC [Doc. No.
182-3]. Further, as discussed above, it was not defamatory for Dorland to assert that Larson had used Dorland's letter in the
irst versions of her story without attribution.

For these reasons, the court finds that Dorland's statements accusing Larson of plagiarism as to the 2016 and 2017
Letters are non-defamatory.

C. Intentional Interference with Advantageous Business Relationships

Larson claims that Dorland and her attorneys, the Cohen Law Group, tortiously interfered with Larson's business
relationships with ASF and BBF. She alleges that ""Dorland and her agents . . . intentionally utilized aggressive and coercive
language . . . in order to cause damage to Larson."" Larson Amended Complaint § 72 [Doc. No. 91]. In response, Dorland
contends that she was appropriately protecting her legal interest in her own intellectual property. Dorland Mem. SJ 29-30
[Doc. No. 184].

To succeed on a claim of tortious interference with business relations, a plaintiff must show: (1) ""a known


--- Page 12 ---
advantageous relationship""; (2) ""deliberate interference""; (3) ""improper [ ] motive or means""; and (4) ""resulting economic
harm."" Tuli v. Brigham & Women's Hosp. , 656 F.3d 33 , 43 (1st Cir. 2011). To reiterate: A plaintiff cannot recover ""where [it]
haf[s] failed to show that [it] ha[s] suffered any pecuniary loss as a result of the defendant's actions."" Hamann v. Carpenter
937 F.3d 86 , 93 (1st Cir. 2019).

Larson has failed to introduce any evidence of pecuniary loss due to Dorland's or her attorneys’ allegedly tortious
interference with the relationships between Larson and ASF/BBF. Larson received the full $300 payment on her contract
with ASF. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 11 [Doc. No. 190-1]; Dorland Resp. SUMF 4 22 [Doc. No. 195]. There is no evidence that
ASF pulled the Summer 2017 short story volume from print publication, which included The Kindest . Even if that were not
the case, the option of online publication was not initially part of Larson's contract with ASF. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 11 [Doc.
No. 190-1]; Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. X [Doc. No. 181-24]. And Larson has introduced no evidence that she was subsequently
entitled to an extended period of online exposure that was cut short by ASF's decision to take the piece down—a decision to
which Larson herself consented, stating to Markovits: ""Go ahead and sunset my piece—you can remove it now, if you'd
like."" Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. EE [Doc. No. 182-5].

[693 F.Supp.3d 87]

In the same vein, there is no evidence that Larson suffered an economic loss because of BBF's decision to cancel
1C1S. To start, Larson's contract with BBF did not include any payment to her for the use of The Kindest . Larson Mem. Su,
Ex. 16 [Doc. No. 190-6]. Perhaps in recognition of this fact, Larson alleges that the cancellation of 1C1S caused her to lose
out on opportunities that ""would likely have advanced her career and provided her with a reasonable expectancy of future
professional and/or economic benefit."" Larson Amended Complaint § 76 [Doc. No. 91]; Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 1 912-13
(Larson Aff.) [Doc. No. 189-1]. But Larson provides no evidence of ""speaking engagements and print, television and radio
interviews"" that were rescinded after 1C1S was cancelled, see Larson Amended Complaint § 76 [Doc. No. 91], or even of
the specific opportunities—and payments for those opportunities—that ""previous One City/One Story winners received."" Id.

For these reasons, Larson has failed to satisfy the fourth element of her tortious interference claim as to both ASF and
BBF.

V. Conclusion

For the reasons stated herein, as to Counts I, Il, and VII of Larson's Second Amended Complaint, Dorland's Motion for
Summary Judgment is GRANTED and Larson's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. Dorland's Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED as to the copyright claims (Count VIII of Larson's Second Amended Complaint and Counts I,
Il, and Ill of Dorland's Counterclaim). Larson's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED as to the copyright claims
where Larson so moved (Counts | and II of Dorland's Counterclaim). 14

Footnotes:

4On January 18, 2016, Larson submitted the same draft of The Kindest for publication in The New Yorker and The Atlantic. Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex.

[Doc. No. 181-9]. A month later, on February 29, 2016, Larson submitted The Kindest for publication in Glimmer Train Magazine. Id. None of these
magazines published the story.

2.In her affidavit, Larson lists approximately 30 individuals and entities contacted by Dorland. Larson Mem. SJ 4 17 [Doc. No. 189-1] (Affidavit of
Sonya Larson). Dorland does not deny these contacts but notes that some of these individuals are leaders or members of the named organizations.
Dorland Resp. SUMF 41 [Doc. No. 195].

3. Larson also sued Attorney Jeffrey Cohen and the Cohen Business Law Group, LLC. Id. These two Defendants were subsequently dismissed by
stipulation. Joint Stipulation [Doc. No. 178].

4. Dorland also sued for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (Count IV), id. , but the court dismissed this claim. Mem. & Order [Doc. No. 99].

5. Dorland also filed a Motion to Strike Larson's Response to Dorland’s Statement of Material Facts [Doc. No. 199] as untimely and prejudicial. The
court denied in part and granted in part Dorland's motion. Elec. Order [Doc. No. 209].

8. Dorland submitted copies of only three versions of The Kindest : (1) the 2016 version published by Brilliance Audio, the Audible.com subsidiary
(""the 2016 Letter""), Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. VV. [Doc. No. 182-22]; (2) the 2017 version published by ASF (""the 2017 Letter""), Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. WW
[Doc. No. 182-23]; and (3) the 2018 copyrighted version of The Kindest (""the 2018 Letter""), Dorland Mem. SJ, Ex. XX [Doc. No. 182-24]. Therefore, the
court considers Dorland's infringement claims only as to those three versions of The Kindest.

Contrary to Dorland's assertion, Dorland Mem. SJ 9 [Doc. No. 184], this court may not assume that a later-edited version of a piece of writing is
""infected with infringement"" merely on the basis that a previous version bore a substantial similarity to copyrighted material. Were that the case, then
authors would always be legally beholden to their first drafts, regardless of the nature of any edits undertaken in subsequent iterations.

8. Larson maintains that the 2016 Letter was published by accident and without her consent. Larson Mem SJ. at 6 [Doc. No. 189]. Larson appears to
suggest—but never explicitly argues—that the 2016 Letter cannot be subject to a copyright infringement claim. Id. at 28. But Larson offers no evidence to
support her assertion that the release of the story on August 3, 2016, occurred without her consent or to suggest that she had not given Plympton the
right to publish the 2016 version of the story. Larson Mem. SJ, Ex. 9 [Doc. No. 189-9]. As such, this court will consider Dorland's copyright infringement
claims against the Brilliance version of The Kindest .

2. Dorland contends that the court should not consider whether The Kindest is parody or criticism because Larson did not expressly raise these
arguments in her brief. In the alternative, Dorland argues that The Kindest is not parody or criticism because its mockery of Dorland was known only to a
limited audience. Dorland Mem. SJ 14-15 [Doc. No. 184]. But Dorland's argument fails to reckon with the rationale behind these exceptions—which is
that parody and criticism of an original work exists orthogonally to that original work. It does not tell the same story, or even speak to the same audience.
Campbell , 510 U.S. at 592, 114 S.Ct. 1164 .



--- Page 13 ---
1°: Dorland asserts that there are not sufficient facts in the record for Larson to carry her burden on this factor. Dorland Mem. SJ 20 [Doc. No. 184].
While it is true that Larson has not, for example, offered expert testimony on the fair market value of a nonfiction letter, she has introduced evidence of
Dorland's ability to publicize the letter, discussed above, and of Dorland's inaction with respect to creating derivative works of the letter since she wrote it
in 2015. Dorland Resp. SUMF 4 70, 73 [Doc. No. 195].

1. The court agrees with Larson that falsely accusing a writer of plagiarism to journals, magazines, writing fellowships, and other writers is the kind
of defamatory statement that would be actionable without a showing of loss. See Larson Mem. SJ 21-22 [Doc. No. 189].

12. Larson concedes that this reasoning would protect any of Dorland's other statements where Dorland also provided excerpts or a copy of her
letter.

13. In contrast, the 2018 Letter substantially altered the text and removed any direct quotes or close paraphrases of the Dorland Letter. Dorland
Resp. Larson SUMF 9 22, 24, 34, 37, 38, 51 [Doc. No. 195]. But each of the allegedly defamatory communications Larson discusses in her Second
Amended Complaint and in her summary judgment papers occurred prior to the publication of the 2018 Letter. Therefore, during the period before the
court in which Dorland was accusing Larson of plagiarism (summer 2017 through summer 2018), the publicly available versions of The Kindest included
language taken verbatim from the Dorland Letter. Id.

14. Larson did not move for summary judgment on her claim for Declaratory Judgment (Count VIII of the Second Amended Complaint) or on
Dorland's claim for Injunctive Relief (Count Ill of the Counterclaims). The court anticipates dismissing the request for injunctive relief as moot, granting
the request for Declaratory Relief for the reasons set forth above, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(1), and entering a final judgment as to all claims. Any
objection to proceeding in this manner shall be filed no later than September 20, 2023.

Synopsis

Background: Parents brought action against social workers,
state officials, and social services organization, asserting
several claims arising out of the State of Michigan's
termination of their parental rights. The United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Avern Cohn,
J., 2007 WL 2335315, dismissed the action for lack of
jurisdiction pursuant to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. Parents
appealed. The Court of Appeals, 283 Fed. Appx. 309, reversed
and remanded. On remand, the District Court, Cohn, J.,
2009 WL 440951, granted summary judgment in favor of
defendants. Parents appealed.

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Siler, Circuit Judge, held
that:

WESTLAW

state court judgments terminating parents' rights lacked res
judicata effect as to parents' tort claims; but

tort claims that constituted a collateral attack on state court
judgments terminating parents! rights were properly excluded
from consideration by the federal courts under the principles
of comity and deference to state expertise in the field of
domestic relations;

social workers were entitled to absolute immunity;

state officials acting in their official capacities were not
persons subject to suit under § 1983; and

reproduction and use of excerpts of father's book during
termination of parental rights proceedings was permissible
under the Copyright Act's fair use doctrine.

Affirmed.

Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal; Motion for Summary
Judgment.

*622 On Appeal from the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan.

Before: SILER and ROGERS, Circuit Judges; BELL, District
Judge. .

Opinion
SILER, Circuit Judge.

Plaintiffs Jennifer Stephens and Urian R. Sturgis, Sr.
(hereinafter “Plaintiffs”)—proceeding pro se and in forma
pauperis-appeal the district court's dismissal of their suit in
which they asserted several claims arising out of the State
of Michigan's termination of their parental rights. We review
de novo the district court's orders of dismissal and grants of
summary judgment. Biegas v. Quickway Carriers, Inc., 573
F.3d 365, 373, 377 (6th Cir.2009). For the following reasons,
we affirm.

As a preliminary matter, several of Plaintiffs' claims are
asserted on behalf of their minor children. Because their
parental rights were terminated, Plaintiffs lack standing to
pursue any claim on behalf of their children. See Elk Grove

Stephens v. Hayes, 374 Fed.Appx. 620 (2010)

Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 17-18, 124 S.Ct.
2301, 159 L.Ed.2d 98 (2004). Plaintiffs, as private citizens,
also lack standing to assert a claim regarding the use of
federal funds by a private entity. See Summers v. Earth Island
Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 129 S.Ct. 1142, 1149, 173 L.Ed.2d 1
(2009).

Plaintiffs' initial complaint was dismissed as frivolous under
28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2). Plaintiffs' two later filed complaints
are equally lacking in an arguable basis in law or in fact;
however, the district court failed to dismiss these complaints
under the in forma pauperis statute. Instead, it consolidated
the two complaints and adjudicated Plaintiffs' claims on
motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment.

Although the district court was ultimately correct in
dismissing Plaintiffs' meritless claims, its application of
the doctrines of claim preclusion and collateral estoppel is
questionable. The dismissal of Plaintiffs' initial complaint
under § 1915(e)(2) was not a dismissal on the merits;
consequently, it arguably lacks res judicata effect except as
to frivolousness determinations for future in forma pauperis
petitions. See Denton v. Hernandez, 504 U.S. 25, 34, 112
S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992); Benson yv. O'Brian,
179 F.3d 1014, 1016 (6th Cir.1999). Claim preclusion
and collateral estoppel only arise where the prior decision
was a final judgment on the merits. Schreiber v. Philips
Display Components Co., 580 F.3d 355, 367 (6th Cir.2009);
Mitchell v. Chapman, 343 F.3d 811, 819 (6th Cir.2003).
Similarly, because the state court proceedings resulting in the
termination of Plaintiffs’ parental rights did not include claims
against any of the named defendants in *623 this case or
their privies, the state court judgments terminating Plaintiffs'
parental rights lack res judicata effect as to Plaintiffs' tort
claims. See Adair v. State, 470 Mich. 105, 680 N.W.2d 386,
396 (2004).

Nevertheless, many of Plaintiffs' tort claims constitute
collateral attacks on the state court judgments terminating
Plaintiffs' parental rights and are properly excluded from
consideration by the federal courts. Under the principles of
comity and deference to state expertise in the field of domestic
relations, it has been our consistent policy to refuse to exercise
jurisdiction over claims which seek to collaterally attack a
state court judgment terminating parental rights. See Castorr
v. Brundage, 674 F.2d 531, 535-36 (6th Cir.1982). “The
whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife,

WESTLAW

parent and child, belongs to the laws of the states, and not to
the laws of the United States.” Jn re Burrus, 136 U.S. 586,
593-94, 10 S.Ct. 850, 34 L.Ed. 500 (1890). Consequently,
we decline to exercise jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims in
which the tort action is a mere pretense and the suit is actually
concerned with child custody issues. See Drewes v. IInicki,
863 F.2d 469, 471 (6th Cir.1988).

Plaintiffs asserted a number of claims against social workers
who played a role in the state's investigation of Plaintiffs'
mistreatment of their children and the proceedings that led
to the termination of their parental rights. Under Michigan
law, “[s]ocial workers are granted absolute immunity from
civil litigation arising out of their work as advisors and
agents of the probate court (now to the family division of
circuit court) because that court provides parents and other
interested parties with a sufficient remedy for any wrongful
action by a social worker.” Beauford v. Lewis, 269 Mich.App.
295, 711 N.W.2d 783, 786 (2005) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Inasmuch as the social workers named as defendants
in this case were simply carrying out their work as advisors
and agents of the family court, they are entitled to absolute
immunity from suit, and Plaintiffs' claims against them must
be dismissed.

Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Plaintiffs asserted official
capacity claims against a number of state officials. “[A] suit
against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a
suit against the official but rather a suit against the official's
office. As such, it is no different from a suit against the
State itself.” Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S.
58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (internal

official capacities are considered “persons” under § 1983.

state a claim under the statute. Plaintiffs’ remaining § 1983

make out any cognizable constitutional claims. See Harden—
Bey v. Rutter, 524 F.3d 789, 796 (6th Cir.2008) (“[C]onclusory

OPINION AND ORDER
Richard J. Sullivan, Circuit Judge:

Plaintiff Akilah Hughes brings this action against Defendant Carl Benjamin and ten ""John Doe"" Defendants for copyright
infringement under 17 U.S.C. § 501 and misrepresentation under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (""DMCA""), 17 U.S.C.
§ 512(f), principally alleging that Benjamin's YouTube video, SUW Levels of Awareness , unlawfully copied Hughes's
YouTube video about the 2016 presidential election, We Thought She Would Win. Now before the Court is Benjamin's
motion to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety. (Doc. No. 30.) For the reasons set forth below, the motion to dismiss is
GRANTED.

|. BACKGROUND

A. The Original Work: We Thought She Would Win

Hughes is a popular ""content creator"" and filmmaker who maintains the YouTube channel ""Akilah Obviously."" 1 (Doc. No. 1
[437 F.Supp.3d 387]

(""Compl."") 4 12.) Her work ""covers a broad range of topics[,] including comedy, race, social commentary, feminism, beauty,
and fashion."" ( /d. )

On November 8, 2016, the night of the 2016 presidential election, Hughes filmed Hillary Clinton's campaign party at the
Jacob Javitz Convention Center in Manhattan. ( /d. ¥ 1.5.) Ten days later, Hughes posted a nine-minute-and-fifty-second
video titled We Thought She Would Win to her YouTube channel. ( Id. § 16; Doc. No. 32, Ex. A (""Hughes Video"").) The
video contained her campaign party footage, as well as her thoughts on the night's events (both during the night and after
the night was over), including commentary on the implications of Secretary Clinton's defeat by now-President Donald Trump.
(Compl. § 16; Hughes Video.) The video begins with Hughes at the Javitz Center, early in the night, stating that she is
""really excited to be ... a woman in the year 2016 after having ... a black president for eight years and now we have Hillary
who could potentially be our next president."" (Hughes Video at 0:29-0:40.) The video then cuts to Hughes reflecting back on
election night after Secretary Clinton's loss, noting that ""no one thought she wasn't going to win, so it started out as a very
exciting evening and like full of hope"" before the mood ""just like crept down, until forever."" ( /d. at 0:47-1:20; see id. at 1:20—
4:38.) The final five minutes of the video consist of wide-ranging commentary, including Hughes urging her audience to
""stand up"" before violence is committed against minorities, her negative feelings toward the year 2016, and her gratitude for
being ""surrounded by like-minded people"" in New York City. ( /d. at 4:38-9:50.) Hughes alleges that she is the sole owner of
the video, and that it is registered with the United States Copyright Office. (Compl. 18.)

B. The Allegedly Infringing Work: SUW Levels of Awareness

Benjamin, like Hughes, is a content creator and filmmaker who maintains the YouTube channels ""Sargon of Akkad"" and
""The Thinkery,"" where he publishes ""anti-ideological and anti-identitarian"" content focusing on "" ‘the left’, racism, feminism,
Black Lives Matter[ ], and Islam."" ( /d. § 34.) Benjamin is ""publicly known for his provocative style and strongly-held beliefs
against liberal social and political stances."" ( /d. ¥ 35.)

The day after publishing We Thought She Would Win , Hughes discovered that Benjamin had posted the video SUW Levels
of Awareness , comprised entirely of six clips of We Thought She Would Win totaling one minute and fifty-eight seconds, to
one of his YouTube Channels. 2( /d. § 20; Doc. No. 32, Ex. C (""Benjamin Video"").)

[437 F.Supp.3d 388]


--- Page 2 ---
According to the Complaint, ""SJW"" is an acronym for ""social justice warrior,"" a term ""routinely used by Benjamin in a
demeaning context to belittle proponents of perceived liberal social policies and stances."" (Compl. § 20.) SUW Levels of
Awareness begins with Hughes expressing her excitement over the potential election of a female president, followed by a
clip depicting her subsequent disappointment over Secretary Clinton's loss. (Benjamin Video at 0:00-0:50.) SUW Levels of
Awareness then cuts to footage of Hughes stating that Trump supporters mean to divide the country, urging people to speak
out against bigotry, and observing that 2016 is the worst year of her life. ( /d. at 0:50-1:48.) The video concludes with
Hughes declaring her appreciation for living with like-minded people in New York City. ( /d. at 1:49-1:58.) SUW Levels of
Awareness includes no commentary or video recorded by Benjamin. (Benjamin Video; Compl. { 22.)

C. The DMCA Takedown Request and Counter Notification

After discovering Benjamin's video, Hughes submitted a ""takedown notice"" to YouTube pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512.
(Compl. § 24.) YouTube then disabled public access to Benjamin's video. ( /d. 4 25.) On November 19, 2016, Benjamin sent
Hughes an email requesting that she withdraw the takedown notice. 3( /d. 4 26.) On November 22, 2016, after Hughes
declined to withdraw her takedown notice, Benjamin sent YouTube a DMCA counter notification claiming that SJW Levels of
Awareness was ""entirely transformative ... and intended for parody."" ( /d. § 30; id. Ex. A.) Benjamin also stated, under
penalty of perjury, that he had ""a good faith belief [that S/W Levels of Awareness ] was removed due to a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."" ( Id. Ex. A.) Hughes alleges that YouTube relied upon
Benjamin's counter notification ""to reinstate certain features of their service, including allowing for the continued public
display of [ SJW Levels of Awareness],"" though she does not specify when YouTube reinstated access to Benjamin's video.
(Id. 4 59.)

D. Procedural History

Hughes initiated this action for damages and injunctive relief on August 25, 2017. Her Complaint sets forth two causes of
action. First, she asserts that Benjamin infringed on her copyright of We Thought She Would Win through his public posting
of SUW Levels of Awareness on YouTube and Twitter, in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 501. ( /d. ¢§ 45-54.) Second, she claims
that Benjamin engaged in DMCA misrepresentation in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) by stating in his YouTube counter
notification that SJW Levels of Awareness was fair use, ""entirely transformative,"" and ""intended for parody."" ( Id. | 55-63.)
On April 20, 2018, Benjamin filed a motion to dismiss Hughes's Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (Doc. No. 31 at 4.) Hughes filed
an opposition on May 18, 2018 (Doc. No. 35), and Benjamin filed a reply on May 30, 2018 (Doc. No. 36). On June 7, 2019,
Benjamin submitted a one-page letter in support of his motion to dismiss, apprising the Court of supplemental authority.
(Doc. No. 37.)

ll. LEGAL STANDARD
To survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must ""provide
[437 F.Supp.3d 389]

the grounds upon which [the] claim rests."" ATS/ Comme'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd. , 493 F.3d 87 , 98 (2d Cir. 2007).
Specifically, a plaintiff must allege ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 , 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) . ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff
pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct

alleged."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) . In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6)
motion to dismiss, a court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in
favor of the plaintiff. ATS/ Commc'ns__ 493 F.3d at 98 . However, that tenet ""is inapplicable to legal conclusions.""/qbal_ 556
U.S. at 678 , 129 S.Ct. 1937 . Thus, a pleading that offers only ""labels and conclusions"" or ""a formulaic recitation of the
elements of a cause of action will not do."" Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 . If the plaintiff ""ha[s] not nudged [its]
claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, [its] complaint must be dismissed."" /d. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955 .

Ill. DISCUSSION
The Court will address Hughes's claims of copyright infringement and DMCA misrepresentation in turn.
A. Copyright Infringement

""To establish a prima facie case of copyright infringement, a plaintiff must demonstrate ‘(1) ownership of a valid copyright,
and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.’ ""Warner Bros. Entm't Inc. v. RDR Books , 575 F.
Supp. 2d 513 , 533 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (quoting Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. 340 , 361,111 S.Ct. 1282 ,
113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) ). A defendant is deemed to have copied constituent elements of the plaintiffs work where ""(1) the
defendant has actually copied the plaintiff's work; and (2) the copying is illegal because a substantial similarity exists
between the defendant's work and the protectible elements of plaintiff's."" Hamil Am.. Inc. v. GFI, 193 F.3d 92 , 99 (2d Cir.

1999) (quoting Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd. , 71 F.3d 996 , 1002 (2d Cir. 1995) ). ""The defendant can defeat a prima facie
showing of infringement,"" however, ""by proving that the doctrine of ‘fair use’ permits"" his or her ""employment of the plaintiff's



--- Page 3 ---
[work]."" Tufenkian Imp./Exp. Ventures, Inc. v. Einstein Moomiy, Inc. , 338 F.3d 127 , 131 (2d Cir. 2003) ;see 17 U.S.C. § 107
(codifying the common-law fair use defense).

Although fair use is an affirmative defense, and thus the defendant ""bears the burden of proving it,"" Fox News Network, LLC
v. Tveyes, Inc. , 883 F.3d 169 , 176 (2d Cir. 2018), fair use can nevertheless be adjudicated on a motion to dismiss,see TCA
Television Corp. v. McCollum , 839 F.3d 168 , 178 (2d Cir. 2016) :Kelly-Brown v. Winfrey . 717 F.3d 295 , 308 (2d Cir.
2013). At this stage of the litigation, the Court's task is to determine whether ""the facts necessary to establish the defense
are evident on the face of the complaint,"" including any materials properly incorporated into the complaint. Kelly-Brown__717
F.3d at 308 ; see also, e.g. , Clark v. Transp. Alts., Inc. , No. 18-cv-9985 (VM), 2019 WL 1448448, at *2-5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18,
2019) (dismissing complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) based on fair use defense after conducting a side-by-side analysis of
the two works attached to the complaint).

In undertaking a fair use analysis, the Court considers the following non-exhaustive list of factors set forth in 17 U.S.C. § 107

[437 F.Supp.3d 390]

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

As the Second Circuit has explained, ""the four listed statutory factors in § 107 guide but do not control [the] fair use analysis
and ‘are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.’ ""Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v.
Carol Publ'g Grp.. Inc. , 150 F.3d 132 , 141 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. 510 U.S. 569 , 577—
78, 114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) ). The ultimate question is ""whether the copyright law's goal of ‘promoting the
Progress of Science and useful Arts’ ... would be better served by allowing the use than by preventing it."" Cariou v. Prince
714 F.3d 694 , 705 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Castle Rock Entm't, 150 F.3d at 141 ).

The Court will consider each of the above statutory factors.
1. Purpose and Character of Use

The first factor, ""[t]he heart of the fair use inquiry,"" concerns the purpose and character of the allegedly infringing use.
Blanch v. Koons , 467 F.3d 244 , 251 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Davis v. The Gap, Inc. , 246 F.3d 152 , 174 (2d Cir. 2001) ). In
the preamble to § 107, Congress identified ""criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research"" as
illustrative purposes of a fair use. 17 U.S.C. § 107 ; see TCA Television, 839 F.3d at 179 . Additionally, the commercial use
of the new work ""may weigh against a finding of fair use,"" which favors non-profit educational purposes. Cariou__714 F.3d at
708 (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). But because ""nearly all of the illustrative uses listed in the
preamble paragraph of § 107 ... are generally conducted for profit in this country,"" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 584 , 114 S.Ct.
1164 (internal quotation marks omitted), courts ""do not give much weight to the fact that the secondary use was for
commercial gain,"" Castle Rock Entm't, 150 F.3d at 142 . Instead, the critical question when applying the first fair use factor
is whether the new work is ""transformative."" TCA Television, 839 F.3d at 180 . Like the overall fair use determination,
whether a work is ""transformative"" is ""an open-ended and context-sensitive inquiry,"" Cariou__714 F.3d at 705 , based on
""how the work in question appears to the reasonable observer,"" id. at 707. ""[T]he critical inquiry is whether the new work
uses the copyrighted material itself for a purpose, or imbues it with a character, different from that for which it was created.""
TCA Television 839 F.3d at 180 .

Most relevant here, a new work may be transformative even where it consists entirely of portions of the original work, or
indeed even where it is an ""exact replication"" of the original work._Sar/ Louis Feraud Int'l v. Viewfinder Inc. 627 F. Supp. 2d
123 , 128 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (Lynch, J.) (collecting cases); see also Swatch Grp. Mamt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P. . 756
F.3d 73 , 84 (2d Cir. 2014) (""[A] secondary work can be transformative in function or purpose without altering or actually
adding to the original work."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). In Baraban v. Time Warner, Inc. , for example, the court
found that the first statutory fair use factor ""weigh[ed] heavily in favor of fair use"" where the defendant had ""copie[d] the
[plaintiff's] photo outright in

[437 F.Supp.3d 391]

order to comment on it and on the ... advertising campaign in which the photo played an integral part."" No. 99-cv-1569
(JSM), 2000 WL 358375, at *3—4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2000). The court noted that the defendant's use of the photo was not
exactly ""parody [ Jor satire as those terms have been defined in the case law,"" but that the defendant's use of the photo in
context — as part of a book containing critical commentary — nevertheless ""clearly [fell] within the permissible use categories


--- Page 4 ---
of ‘comment’ and ‘criticism.’ "" /d. at *3 ; see also, e.g. , Yang v. Mic Network, Inc. , 405 F. Supp. 3d 537, 543-45 (S.D.N.Y.
2019) (similar) (collecting cases).

Here, it is clear from the face of Hughes's Complaint that Benjamin copied portions of We Thought She Would Win for the
transformative purposes of criticism and commentary. Beginning with the title of Benjamin's work, SUW Levels of Awareness
, Hughes herself acknowledges that ""SJW"" or ""social justice warrior"" is a term ""routinely used by Benjamin in a demeaning
context to belittle proponents of perceived liberal social policies and stances."" (Compl. § 20.) Although Hughes contends
that her own subjective awareness of the term's meaning does not establish that a ""reasonable observer"" would interpret the
term ""SJW"" in a pejorative manner (Doc. No. 35 at 9), the Court concludes that ""SJW"" or ""Social Justice Warrior"" has
sufficiently entered the modern lexicon such that there can be no serious dispute as to its pejorative meaning in this context.
See, e.g. , Oxford Univ. Press, social justice warrior , Lexico, https://www.lexico.com/definition/social_justice_warrior (last
updated 2019) (defining ""social justice warrior"" as a ""derogatory"" term for ""[a] person who expresses or promotes socially
progressive views""); Laura Wagner, Can You Use That In A Sentence? Dictionary Adds New Words , NPR: The Two-Way
(Aug. 7, 2015, 4:08 PM), https:/www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/201 5/08/27/435232388/can-you-use-that-in-a-sentence-
dictionary-adds-new-words; Abby Ohlheiser, Why ‘Social Justice Warrior,’ a Gamergate Insult, Is Now a Dictionary Entry ,
Wash. Post (Oct. 7, 2015, 7:00 AM), https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/10/07/why-social-justice-
warrior-a-gamergate-insult-is-now-a-dictionary-entry; see also Nix v. Hedden, 149 U.S. 304 , 307, 13 S.Ct. 881 , 37 L.Ed.
745 (1893) (explaining that ""dictionaries are admitted, not as evidence, but only as aids to the ... understanding of the
court""). 4And ""levels of awareness"" is plainly used in a sarcastic manner when combined with ""SJW,"" implying a lack of
awareness concerning social or political matters.

Moreover, the critical nature of S/W Levels of Awareness is apparent from the broader context of Benjamin's YouTube
channel, where it was posted. See Cariou__714 F.3d at 705 ; see also, e.g. , BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media,

LLC, 87 F. Supp. 3d 499, 507 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (finding the use of copied photographs transformative based on the
surrounding context in which they were published). As the Complaint alleges, Benjamin ""routinely engages and criticizes
viewpoints on various social and political issues"" on his YouTube

[437 F.Supp.3d 392]

channels, specifically targeting topics such as feminism, ""the left,"" and Black Lives Matter. (Compl. { 34.) Thus, whether
SJW Levels of Awareness is accessed by searching for ""SJW""-related content on YouTube or by going directly to
Benjamin's YouTube channel (or in some other way), a reasonable observer who came across the video would quickly
grasp its critical purpose.

Furthermore, although courts have found transformative uses even in cases involving exact copying, the Court notes that
SJW Levels of Awareness is not an exact copy of We Thought She Would Win. Rather, Benjamin excerpted We Thought
She Would Win to depict the specific moments he felt exemplified Hughes's political identity and lack of awareness. For
example, Benjamin included Hughes's prediction and hope that Secretary Clinton would win the election, while omitting
footage that did not support his message, like Hughes's statement that Secretary Clinton won the popular vote with ""record
numbers."" And he excluded content unrelated to his criticism, like Hughes's commentary on the societal benefits of
YouTube. In this way, Benjamin excerpted We Thought She Would Win to maximize his criticism of Hughes's liberal
viewpoint. 5

Finally, although the commercial nature of an allegedly infringing work is not necessarily a significant factor, see, e.g. ,
Cariou__714 F.3d at 708 , the Court notes that the Complaint barely mentions the commercial or non-commercial nature of
SJW Levels of Awareness. At most, the Complaint alleges generally that ""Defendants have unfairly derived profits from [
SJW Levels of Awareness ] in the form of advertising revenues generated from its upload to and availability on YouTube,""
and ""from increased popularity of their YouTube channel attributed to [ SJW Levels of Awareness]."" (Compl. 4 44.) The
Complaint, however, does not specify how the increased popularity of Benjamin's YouTube channel commercially benefited
Benjamin himself, nor does the Complaint indicate whether the referenced advertising revenues accrued to Benjamin or to
YouTube. In any event, insofar as there is a commercial aspect to SJW Levels of Awareness , it pales in significance to the
considerations discussed above. See, e.g. , Cariou_., 714 F.3d at 708 (""Although there is no question that [the defendant's]
artworks are commercial, we do not place much significance on that fact due to the transformative nature of the work."").

Because a reasonable observer would plainly infer from the title of Benjamin's video, the context in which it was posted, and
its selective copying, that it was intended to criticize Hughes and comment on her perceived lack of awareness, the first fair
use factor favors Benjamin.

2. The Nature of the Copyrighted Work

The second fair use factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, ""calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core
of intended copyright protection than others,"" like works intended for ""creative expression for public dissemination.""
Campbell_ 510 U.S. at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . Applying this factor, courts consider ""(1) whether the [copyrighted] work is
expressive or creative, ... with a greater leeway being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work is factual or
informational, and (2) whether the work is published or unpublished, with the scope for fair use involving unpublished works
being considerably



--- Page 5 ---
[437 F.Supp.3d 393]

narrower."" Blanch__467 F.3d at 256 (quoting 2 Howard B. Abrams, The Law of Copyright , § 15:52 (2006)). The second fair
use factor, however, ""may be of limited usefulness where the creative work of art is being used for a transformative
purpose."" Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. , 448 F.3d 605 , 612 (2d Cir. 2006) ;see also Campbell__510 U.S.
at 586 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 (explaining that the nature of the copyrighted work is ""not much help ... in separating the fair use
sheep from the infringing goats in a parody case, since parodies almost invariably copy publicly known, expressive works"").

Here, the second fair use factor is essentially neutral and of little import. As for the first Blanch consideration, Hughes's work
is ""factual or informational"" in that it provides a first-hand account of a newsworthy event, but it also has ""expressive or
creative"" value in both its commentary and production. Blanch__467 F.3d at 256 (internal quotation marks omitted), With
respect to the second Blanch consideration, We Thought She Would Win is a published work, and thus the scope of fair use
in this context is not ""considerably narrower"" than it would be if it had been unpublished. /d. (internal quotation marks
omitted). Given these countervailing considerations, and the fact that SJW Levels of Awareness is plainly transformative, the
second fair use factor has little impact here.

3. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

The third statutory fair use factor turns on ""whether ‘the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole’ ... [is] reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" Campbell 510 U.S. at 586 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 107 ). In assessing this factor, the Court considers ""not only ‘the quantity of the materials
used’ but also ‘their quality and importance.’ "" TCA Television. 839 F.3d at 185 (quoting Campbell_, 510 U.S. at 587 , 114
S.Ct. 1164 ). ""The crux of the inquiry is whether ‘no more [content] was taken than necessary,’ "" given the purpose and
character of the allegedly infringing use. Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust , 755 F.3d 87 , 98 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Campbell

510 U.S. at 589 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ); see also Bill Graham Archives, 448 F.3d at 613 (""[T]he third-factor inquiry must take
into account that ... the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use."" (internal quotation
marks omitted)). Thus, the third factor may favor the defendant even where the defendant copies an entire work, provided
hat such copying was reasonably necessary in relation to the work's transformative purpose. See, e.g. , Authors Guild_, 755
F.3d at 98 —-99 ; see also, e.g. , Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs.__756 F.3d at 90 (concluding that the third fair use factor was
neutral where an entire work was copied).

Here, SUW Levels of Awareness copied 20% of We Thought She Would Win , a percentage which, while greater than that
ound unreasonable in some cases in this Circuit, see Robinson v. Random House, Inc. . 877 F. Supp. 830 , 842 (S.D.N.Y.

1995) (collecting cases), was still far less than the entire video, see, e.g. , Authors Guild, 755 F.3d at 98 . In addition,
although the selected excerpts were important to Hughes's video (at least as important as any other part of her video), they

were also linked to the critical purpose of SJW Levels of Awareness. As noted above, Benjamin did not copy parts of
Hughes's video that undermined or were unrelated to the critical purpose of SJW Levels of Awareness. Notably, Benjamin
also did not copy every part of We Thought She Would Win that evinced Hughes's progressive views. Rather, Benjamin
copied as much of

437 F.Supp.3d 394]

We Thought She Would Win as was deemed reasonably necessary for him to convey his critical message. In these
circumstances, the third factor tips in favor of Benjamin.

4. The Effect on the Potential Market for the Copyrighted Work

The fourth fair use factor concerns ""whether the secondary use usurps the market of the original work."" Blanch__467 F.3d at
258 (quoting NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst. , 364 F.3d 471 , 482 (2d Cir. 2004) ). A defendant usurps the original work's market
when ""the infringer's target audience and the nature of the infringing content is the same as the original."" Cariou_, 714 F.3d
at 709 . Thus, ""[t]he more transformative the secondary use, the less [the] likelihood that the secondary use substitutes for
he original."" Castle Rock Entm't, 150 F.3d at 145 .

Here, there is no danger that SUW Levels of Awareness will usurp the market of progressive commentaries such as We
Thought She Would Win. Benjamin's target audience (generally political conservatives and libertarians) is obviously not the
same as Hughes's target audience (generally political liberals). See Cariou.. 714 F.3d at 709 . Moreover, although SJW
Levels of Awareness is comprised entirely of portions of We Thought She Would Win, there is no reason to think that
Hughes's audience will abandon her progressive YouTube channel to watch the derisively-titled SJW Levels of Awareness
on a conservative YouTube channel simply because it contains parts of her work. Thus, the fourth fair use factor, like the
irst and third factors, favors Benjamin.

Because three of the four statutory fair use factors favor Benjamin, including the most important factor (purpose and
character of use), and the least important factor (nature of the copyrighted work) is neutral, the Court concludes that the fair
use defense clearly applies based on the face of Hughes's Complaint and a review of the videos themselves. Accordingly,
Hughes has failed to state a claim of copyright infringement for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6).



--- Page 6 ---
B. DMCA Misrepresentation

The DMCA allows online service providers to avoid copyright liability if they comply with the procedures set forth in 17
U.S.C. § 512. See Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. , 815 F.3d 1145 , 1151 (9th Cir. 2016). Specifically, a service provider may
avail itself of the safe harbor provisions in Section 512 by ""expeditiously"" disabling access to allegedly infringing material
upon receipt of a so-called ""takedown notice."" 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(1)(C). A copyright owner who submits a takedown notice
must include a statement, under penalty of perjury, that she has ""a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner
complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner."" /d. § 512(c)(3)(A)(v)—(vi). In response, the creator of the allegedly
infringing work may file a ""counter notification,"" in which the alleged infringer must attest ""under penalty of perjury that the
subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the
material to be removed or disabled."" Id. § 512(g)(3)(C). Upon receipt of the counter notification, the service provider can
again avoid liability by restoring access to the allegedly infringing material in ten to fourteen business days. /d. § 512(g)(2)
(C). However, ""[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section ... that material or activity was
removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification"" is liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees, incurred by
the copyright holder ""as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation

[437 F.Supp.3d 395]
in ... replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it."" Id. § 512(f).

Here, Hughes alleges that Benjamin knowingly and materially misrepresented in his counter notification that SJW Levels of
Awareness was fair use, ""entirely transformative,"" and ""intended for parody."" (Compl. §§ 30, 57-58; id. Ex. A.) These
allegations fall short. Benjamin's implied statement that his video constituted fair use (the counter notification itself does not
actually use the term ""fair use"") was accurate for the reasons stated in this Opinion and Order. As a court in this district has
explained, ""[i]t is self-evident that a statement cannot be a ‘misrepresentation’ for purposes of 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) if it is
factually accurate,"" Hosseinzadeh v. Klein , 276 F. Supp. 3d 34, 47 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), and the same is of course true for
statements that are legally accurate. Similarly, Benjamin did not misrepresent that his video was ""transformative."" Whether it
was "" entirely transformative,"" as stated in his counter notification, or merely ""transformative,"" is immaterial as a legal matter.
Cf. Kshetrapal v. Dish Network, LLC , No. 14-cv-3527 (PAC), 2018 WL 1474375, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 2018) (explaining,
in the defamation context, that plaintiff's ""exaggerat[ion]"" was ""mere hyperbole or a matter of opinion, and not false""). Last,
the Complaint fails to plausibly plead a misrepresentation in the form of Benjamin's statement that SUW Levels of
Awareness was ""intended for parody."" (Compl. | 58; id. Ex. A.) Even if SJW Levels of Awareness was not, strictly speaking,
""parody"" as that term has been defined in the case law, Baraban , 2000 WL 358375, at *3, the difference between ""parody""
and non-parodic copying for the purpose of mocking criticism is subtle, and ultimately immaterial here. Moreover, it is
implausible to suggest that Benjamin knowingly adopted one of these two characterizations over the other in an effort to
mask his intentions. Because the Complaint therefore does not plausibly allege that Benjamin made misrepresentations in
his counter notification, let alone knowing and material misrepresentations, Hughes's DMCA claim fails.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Benjamin's motion to dismiss is GRANTED, Although Hughes
has not requested leave to amend the Complaint, the Court notes that leave to amend would be futile. The Court's analysis
above is principally based on its review of the two works at issue and the context in which they were posted, rather than any
allegations that may be refined in amended pleadings. Thus, the dismissal is with prejudice, and the Clerk of Court is
respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at document number 30 and close this case.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:

1 In ruling on the motion to dismiss, the Court has considered the Complaint, the YouTube counter notification attached as Exhibit A to the Complaint,
and the original and allegedly infringing videos at issue (authentic copies of which were submitted to the Court (Doc. No. 32, Exs. A and C)), which are
incorporated by reference into the Complaint (Doc. No. 1 9 17, 20). See McCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp.__482 F.3d 184 , 191 (2d Cir. 2007) ; see
also Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Dev. Corp. , 602 F.3d 57 , 64 (2d Cir. 2010) (""In copyright infringement actions, the works themselves
supersede and control contrary descriptions of them, including any contrary allegations, conclusions or descriptions of the works contained in the
pleadings."" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).

2The Complaint alleges that SUW Levels of Awareness copied one minute and twenty-eight seconds from We Thought She Would Win (Compl. { 20),
but a review of the work itself, which ""supersede[s] and control[s] ... contrary allegations ... contained in the pleadings,"" Peter F. Gaito Architecture__602
E.3d at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted), reveals that SJW Levels of Awareness copied thirty seconds more than alleged (Doc. No. 32, Ex. C).

30On the same day, Benjamin also posted SUW Levels of Awareness to his Twitter account, where it remained publicly accessible until his account was
suspended on August 9, 2017. (Compl. {{ 28-29.)

4The Court takes judicial notice of the news articles (which report on the Lexico dictionary entry) for the ""fact of their publication,"" since the articles
predate Benjamin's posting of SJW Levels of Awareness and thus show that SJWwas in a dictionary as a derogatory term at that time. /n re Merrill

Lynch & Co., Inc. Research Reports Sec. Litig._. 289 F. Supp. 2d 416 , 425 n.15 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (""The Court may take judicial notice of newspaper
articles for the fact of their publication without transforming the motion into one for summary judgment."").

2To the extent Benjamin's selective excerpting was not ""fair"" to Hughes in the colloquial sense of accurately conveying her level of awareness, courts will


--- Page 7 ---
not, except in rare circumstances, reject a fair use defense based on the inaccuracy of a critical work. See Wojnarowicz v. Am. Family Ass'n , 745 EF.
Supp. 130 , 143-44 (S.D.N.Y. 1990).

Decided: November 22, 2016

Synopsis

Background: Consulting firm that offered expert testimony
regarding reasonableness of legal fees and its owner
brought action against insurer, which listed owner as
potential expert witness in underlying insurance coverage
action, alleging trademark infringement under Lanham
Act, copyright infringement, breach of contract, unjust
enrichment, conversion, and unauthorized use of name. The
United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia, T.S. Ellis, II, Senior District Judge, dismissed,
inter alia, unjust enrichment, unauthorized use of name, and
trademark infringement claims, and, 2014 WL 5161197, 2014
WL 7238856, entered summary judgment in favor of insurer
on remaining claims. Firm and owner appealed.

Holdings: The Court of Appeals held that:

owner and firm failed to state claim for unjust enrichment;

owner failed to state claim for unauthorized use of name;

Virginia's two-year statute of limitations for fraud claims,
rather than Virginia's five-year statute of limitations for

WESTLAW

injury to property claims, applied to Lanham Act trademark
infringement claim;

owner and firm failed to state claim for copyright
infringement of their proposal for services;

owner and firm failed to state claim for breach of contract;

insurer was not liable to owner for conversion of his name
and reputation; and

insurer was not liable to owner for copyright infringement in
connection with owner's resume.

Affirmed.

infringement, and copyright infringement. After the district

court dismissed all of their claims, Appellants timely

appealed. lp inding no error, we affirm the judgment of the
district court.

Appellant John W. Toothman is a lawyer and the founder
of Devil's Advocate, a consulting firm that provides expert
testimony regarding the reasonableness of legal fees. In
2008, Appellee Zurich became *259
coverage dispute in state court in Harris County, Texas (the

embroiled in a

“Texas litigation”). 2 On October 12, 2010, Blair Dancy, a
lawyer representing Zurich in the Texas litigation, contacted
Toothman about serving as an expert witness regarding
the reasonableness of the attorneys’ fees billed by defense
counsel in the case. Toothman responded by email, indicating
his availability and attaching a copy of a blank form billing
agreement (“Billing Agreement’), his resume, and additional
information about Devil's Advocate's services. The Billing
Agreement included no fee terms, leaving several blank
spaces where the parties could later insert such terms should
they reach an agreement. Neither Dancy nor anyone else
representing Zurich signed the Billing Agreement.

Less than a month later, on November 2, 2010, Dancy asked
Appellants to provide a proposal for services to include
review of billing records and other pertinent information
relevant to the disputed defense fees, as well as providing
potential trial testimony. Toothman responded with an email
proposal (“Proposal”), which stated: “Assuming we review
at least $4 million in bills (fees and expenses) and the bill
formats are consistent with the sample bill you provided,
we are quoting a fee for your project of 2.1% of the gross
amount of the fees we would review and report upon.”
J.A. 314. Further, it made plain that “[t]his proposal is
preliminary, prior to our engagement and full review of
available information.” J.A. 315. Toothman did not include a
completed Billing Agreement with his email.

Toothman contacted Dancy two days later to determine if
he had received the Proposal. After confirming that he had,
Dancy informed Toothman that “[t]he client's mulling it
over.” J.A. 322. Toothman followed up four days later, on
November 8, 2010, with an email inquiring whether there had

WESTLAW

been “[a]ny word yet from Zurich” regarding the Proposal.
J.A. 294-95; J.A. 322.

No later than November 19, 2010, Dancy informed Toothman
by telephone that Zurich would not accept the Proposal
because the parties still needed to negotiate the price
of the proposed services. Dancy also notified Toothman
that, because the deadline for designating experts had
passed, Zurich needed leave of court to designate him
as an expert witness. Dancy explicitly stated that such
designation was a condition precedent to Zurich's acceptance
of Toothman's Proposal. Ultimately, although Toothman
continued to negotiate his fee with Dancy, the parties never
reached an agreement.

In an email update dated November 16, 2010, Dancy advised
Toothman that the court in Texas had postponed the trial
and pre-trial conference in the litigation, a development that
impeded Zurich's ability to amend its expert designation
to include Toothman. Toothman responded to this news on

November 19, 2010: “Just checking in. I'm assuming this
may be shut down for some time, but the more time we can
spend on the review, the better.” J.A. 408-09. Also on the
19th, Dancy served opposing counsel in the Texas litigation
with Zurich's proposed amended expert designation naming
Toothman. Thereafter, in an email dated December 2, 2010,
Toothman acknowledged that Zurich had not yet hired him.
J.A. 296; J.A. 410 (“I'll be careful, if I ever get hired.”).

The next day, Dancy filed an amended motion for a Rule 166 5
pretrial conference *260 in the Texas litigation, seeking
leave to amend Zurich's expert designation and attaching the
amended designation naming Toothman.

Toothman was aware that Zurich needed court approval of his
late designation before it could accept Appellants’ Proposal.
In a December 8, 2010, email to Dancy, Toothman confirmed
that, although Zurich had provided his name to the court, he
knew he had not yet been retained to perform any work under
the Proposal.

On December 13, 2010, Toothman again emailed Dancy,
advising him that “[i]n case this thing goes forward,” the total
amount of legal fees he had received for review was just under
$3.5 million, a difference of $500,000 from the $4 million
originally estimated in the Proposal. J.A. 297; J.A. 422. The

2016 Copr.L.Dec. P 31,018
next day, he acknowledged to Dancy that Zurich had neither

accepted the Proposal nor retained him: “[I]s there any way to
make sure Zurich's ready to go right after the hearing, e.g., by
approving our agreement and cutting the initial check?” J.A.
297; J.A. 428.

Finally, on December 29, 2010, Toothman sent Dancy the
following email: “Attached is the paperwork to get this
project going once you decide what to do.... We would
start as soon as we received the signed agreement and
initial payment.” J.A. 297; J.A. 430. Attached was a Billing
Agreement listing a flat fee of $69,233.82, based on 2.0%
of the gross amount of fees and expenses subject to review,
estimated by Toothman to be at least $3.4 million. This
was the first Billing Agreement submitted by Toothman that
included a specific fee estimate. Also attached was an invoice
totaling $34,616.91, purportedly representing one-half of the
estimate. Dancy never signed this Billing Agreement and
denies ever agreeing to its terms.

On January 13, 2011, Toothman emailed Dancy, claiming
“[payment of the full fee was triggered when Zurich
designated me as its expert on December 3, 2010.” J.A. 433.
He also attached an account statement, with two invoices
totaling $69,233.82. Dancy called Toothman on January
17, 2011, to discuss the email and invoices, but Toothman
terminated the call. Zurich then concluded that it could not
work with Toothman and withdrew its request for leave to
designate him as an expert witness in the Texas litigation. It
confirmed this to Toothman in a letter dated January 17, 2011.
J.A. 438-40.

Toothman and Devil's Advocate responded by suing Zurich
in the Circuit Court for Fairfax County, Virginia in February
2011. Several days prior to trial, however, they voluntarily
dismissed their claims pursuant to Virginia's nonsuit statute.
Later, on October 7, 2013, they sued Zurich in the Eastern
District of Virginia, alleging claims of breach of contract,
unjust enrichment, conversion, unauthorized use of name,
trademark infringement, and copyright infringement.

The district court granted in part Zurich's motion to dismiss
the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), dismissing
Appellants’ claims for unjust enrichment, conversion (except
as to Toothman's name and reputation), unauthorized use of
name, trademark infringement, and copyright infringement
(except as to Toothman's resume). It later denied Appellants’

WESTLAW

motions for reconsideration and to amend their complaint.
Finally, after the conclusion of discovery, it granted Zurich's
*261 motion for summary judgment on all remaining
claims.

IL.

Appellants challenge the district court's dismissal of several
of their claims for failure to state a claim, its dismissal on
summary judgment of their remaining claims, and its denial of
leave to amend their complaint. We review de novo the district
court's dismissal for failure to state a claim, for which we
accept the pleaded facts as true. King v. Rubenstein, 825 F.3d
206, 214 (4th Cir. 2016). To survive dismissal, the complaint
“must contain ‘enough facts to state a claim for relief that is
plausible on its face.’ ” Id. at 214 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d
929 (2007)).

We also review de novo the district court's decision to grant
summary judgment, applying the same legal standards that
guided the district court. Hoschar vy. Appalachian Power Co.,
739 F.3d 163, 169 (4th Cir. 2014). Thus, “we view the facts
and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable
to the non-moving party.” Hoschar, 739 F.3d at 169 (quoting
Glynn v. EDO Corp., 710 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 2013)).

Finally, we apply an abuse of discretion standard when
reviewing the district court's decision to deny Appellants’
motion for leave to amend their complaint. We turn now to
each of Appellants’ claims and address them in order.

A.

We begin with the district court's dismissal of Appellants’
claim for unjust enrichment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)
(6). In order to state a claim of unjust enrichment under
Virginia law, a plaintiff must sufficiently allege that “(1) he
conferred a benefit on [the defendant]; (2) [the defendant]
knew of the benefit and should have reasonably expected
to repay [the plaintiff]; and (3) [the defendant] accepted or
retained the benefit without paying for its value.” Schmidt v.
Household Fin. Corp., Il, 276 Va. 108, 661 S.E.2d 834, 838
(2008). A plaintiff “must plead facts showing that it actually

2016 Copr.L.Dec. P 31,018
conferred a benefit.” Odyssey Imaging, LLC v. Cardiology

Assoc. of Johnston, LLC, 752 F.Supp.2d 721, 725 (W.D. Va.
2010) (emphasis added).

Appellants’ complaint contained only conclusory allegations
regarding actual benefits conferred on Zurich. Indeed, the
only benefits alleged were items and services Appellants
provided free of charge during the proposal process.
Appellants, moreover, were fully apprised that Zurich
intended to use some of that material in an effort to amend its
expert witness designation, and that approval of the amended
designation was a condition precedent to Zurich's acceptance
of their Proposal.

Appellants’ assertion that the mere use of their names could
promote a better settlement for Zurich is wholly speculative
and one that, in any case, Zurich could not have realized,
having withdrawn its motion to designate Toothman as an
expert before settling the Texas litigation. We therefore
conclude that the allegations in Appellants’ complaint fail to
state a plausible claim for unjust enrichment. Twombly, 550
USS. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955; Rubenstein, 825 F.3d at 214.

B.

The district court dismissed Appellants’ state law claims
against Zurich for unauthorized use of Devil's Advocate's
corporate name and Toothman's personal name. Virginia
Code § 8.01—40(A), in pertinent part, provides:

*262 Any person whose name,
portrait, or picture is used without
having first obtained the written
consent of such person, or if dead,
of the surviving consort and if none,
of the next of kin, or if a minor, the
written consent of his or her parent or
guardian, for advertising purposes or
for the purposes of trade, such persons
may maintain a suit in equity against
the person, firm, or corporation so
using such person's name, portrait, or
picture to prevent and restrain the use
thereof; and may also sue and recover

WESTLAW

damages for any injuries sustained by
reason of such use....

A corporate entity is not a “person” for purposes of the
Virginia statute. The language of § 8.01-40(A) plainly
includes only natural persons, as demonstrated by its
discussion of the ramifications of the death of the aggrieved
person. See also Silver Ring Splint Co. v. Digisplint, Inc.,
567 F.Supp.2d 847, 855 (W.D. Va. 2008) (“Although the term
‘person’ in a statute may often refer to both natural persons
and corporations, the text of § 8.01-40 makes clear that

this statute applies only to natural persons.”). Accordingly,
Appellants’ claim against Zurich for unauthorized use of
Devil's Advocate's corporate name cannot proceed.

Toothman's claim for the unauthorized use of his personal
name similarly fails. “[A] name is used for advertising
purposes when it appears in a publication which, taken in
its entirety, was distributed for use in, or as part of, an
advertisement or solicitation for patronage of a particular
product or service.” Town & Country Properties, Inc. v.
Riggins, 249 Va. 387, 457 S.E.2d 356 (1995); see also WJLA—
TV v. Levin, 264 Va. 140, 564 S.E.2d 383, 395 (2002)
(quoting Riggins and similarly holding that use of a name for
non-advertising purposes does not implicate § 8.01—-40(A)).

Zurich's use of Toothman's name, in either a court filing or
email to opposing counsel, does not constitute advertising.
Nor did Zurich use Toothman's name in the course of its own
business to buy, sell, or barter its goods or services. Va. Code §
8.01—40(A). Indeed, we are unable to discern what additional
legal services Zurich could have intended to solicit by the
mere use of Toothman's name and conclude Zurich did not
violate § 8.01-40(A).

Cc.

In dismissing Appellants’ trademark infringement claim as
time-barred, the district court applied Virginia's two-year
limitation period applicable to fraud claims. The Lanham
Act, which governs Appellants’ trademark claims, does
not specify a statute of limitations, but rather applies the
analogous state law limitations period. See PBM Products.
LLC v. Mead Johnson & Co., 639 F.3d 111, 121 (4th Cir.

Devil's Advocate, LLC v. Zurich American Insurance Company, 666 Fed.Appx. 256 (2016)

2016 Copr.L.Dec. P 31,018
2011)(finding false advertising claim under the Lanham Act

analogous to Virginia fraud law and subject to two-year

limitation). *

Devil's Advocate, however, insists that under Virginia law
trademarks and brand names are property subject to a five
year statute of limitations. In Lavery v. Automation Mgmt.
Consultants, Inc., 234 Va. 145, 360 S.E.2d 336 (1987), a
case dealing specifically with the prohibition in Virginia
Code § 8.01-40(A) regarding the unauthorized *263 use

of a person's name, > the Supreme Court of Virginia held
that, where a defendant uses a plaintiffs name to bolster
its proposal for a contract, a property right exists in the
plaintiffs name or likeness that is subject to the five year
property claim statute of limitations. Lavery simply has no
bearing on federal trademark analysis under the Lanham Act.
Accordingly, we agree with the district court's conclusion
that Devil's Advocate's trademark infringement claim is time-
barred under Virginia's two-year statute of limitations for
fraud.

D.

The district court dismissed Appellants’ claim against Zurich
for copyright infringement, finding the Proposal lacked
substantial similarity to the designation filed by Zurich in the
Texas litigation. A plaintiff seeking to recover on a copyright
infringement claim must prove not only that he “owned a
valid copyright and that the defendant copied the original
elements of that copyright,” but also that the “defendant's
work is ‘substantially similar’ to the protectable elements of
the plaintiff's work.” Building Graphics, Inc. v. Lennar Corp.,
708 F.3d 573, 577-78 (4th Cir. 2013) (quotations omitted).

Determining “substantial similarity” involves an analysis
of extrinsic and intrinsic similarity. Humphreys & Partners
Architects, L.P. v. Lessard Design, Inc., 790 F.3d 532,
537-38 (4th Cir. 2015) (citations omitted). We evaluate
extrinsic similarity objectively, looking at “external criteria”
to determine whether the alleged copy is substantially similar

to the “protected elements of the copyrighted work.” Id. at 538
(quoting Universal Furniture Int'l, Inc. v. Collezione Europa
USA, Inc., 618 F.3d 417, 435 (4th Cir. 2010)). In contrast,
we consider intrinsic similarity from the “perspective of the
[works’] intended observer,” looking at the “total concept and

WESTLAW

feel of the works” to determine whether they are substantially
similar. Id. (quoting Universal Furniture, 618 F.3d at 436).

The district court concluded that Appellants’ copyright
infringement claim failed for lack of substantial similarity.
Although Appellants contend that only a jury may determine
the extrinsic similarity prong, we observed in Copeland v.
Bieber that

... a district court may grant a motion to dismiss or summary
judgment under the extrinsic prong alone. See Universal
Furniture, 618 F.3d at 436 (“A court may grant summary
judgment for defendant as a matter of law if the similarity
between the two works concerns only noncopyrightable
elements of the plaintiff's work.” (quoting Herzog v. Castle
Rock Entm't, 193 F.3d 1241, 1257 (11th Cir.1999))); see
also Lyons [Partnership, L.P. v. Morris Costumes, Inc., 243
F.3d 789, 803 (4th Cir. 2001)] (court decides as a “matter
of law” whether extrinsic similarity exists).

789 F.3d 484, 490 (4th Cir. 2015). Therefore, a district court
may properly dismiss a copyright claim in the absence of
substantial similarity.

Our review of the extrinsic nature of the two documents
reinforces the conclusion that they lack substantial similarity.
The Proposal discusses Appellants’ conflicts, Toothman's
familiarity with the parties involved, his academic and
professional experience, an overview of the billing structure,
and some observations on the Texas litigation. The expert
designation, by contrast, generally summarizes the subject
matter on which Zurich's two experts would testify without
specifying the material about *264 which either intended to
opine. Appellants accuse Zurich of plagiarizing the Proposal,
but a review of the two documents convinces us not only that
there is no substantial similarity, but little if any similarity.

With regard to the intrinsic similarity prong, we find scant
similarity in the “concept and feel” between the Proposal
and the designation Zurich submitted to the Texas court.
Humphreys, 790 F.3d at 538. The former is an offer for
services, covering a variety of topics, the latter a court filing
discussing the subject matter on which Zurich's two experts
would testify. It is implausible that any intended audience
could view these two documents as intrinsically similar.

E.

Devil's Advocate's breach of contract claim fails for want of
any evidence that the parties had the necessary meeting of the
minds to form an enforceable contract. While it concedes the
parties never physically executed a contract, Devil's Advocate
nevertheless argues that Zurich implicitly agreed to the terms
of the Proposal.

In Charbonnages de France v. Smith, 597 F.2d 406, 414—
15 (4th Cir. 1979), we concluded that when parties engage
in lengthy, drawn out negotiations, which include a “jumble

of letters, telegrams, acts, and spoken words,” it is for a
jury to decide whether they actually formed a contract. Id.
at 415; see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 20,

Comment c. (1981). © No “jumble” of contract negotiations
occurred in this case, but rather an unequivocal rejection
by Zurich of the Appellants’ Proposal as “unacceptable.”
J.A. 353-54. Toothman, moreover, acknowledged that Zurich
“wanted to pay less.” J.A. 373-74. Consequently, our holding
in Charbonnages raises no bar to summary judgment.

Devil's Advocate's contract claim rests solely on its argument
that the use of its name, in either the expert designation or
email to opposing counsel, manifested Zurich's assent to the
contract. Dancy, however, testified that during a telephone
call in early November he notified Toothman that Zurich
could not retain him until allowed by the Texas Court to
amend its expert designation. Toothman was fully aware of
this condition precedent.

Toothman baldly asserts that this telephone call never
happened, but the evidence in the record is otherwise.
Particularly damning is Toothman's email of November
8, 2010, explicitly acknowledging his understanding that
although Zurich had disclosed his name it had not yet retained

him: “Naming me as a witness before we were retained

is likely to cause some issues with Gardere and Voys.””

J.A. 425. Toothman, a lawyer, plainly understood Zurich's
obligation to disclose his name to the Texas court in order to
obtain leave to amend its expert designation.

Finally, Appellants’ argument that Zurich's designation
triggered acceptance of the contract is unavailing. The record

WESTLAW

is devoid of any evidence, disputed or otherwise, that Zurich
ever assented to a contract in this case.

*265 F.

The district court granted summary judgment to Zurich
on Toothman's claim for conversion of his name and

reputation. 8 To recover on a claim of conversion under
Virginia law, a plaintiff must establish (1) that he owned or
had a possessory right to the property at the time of the alleged
conversion, and (2) that the defendant wrongfully exercised

dominion or control over that property, thereby depriving

plaintiff of its possession. ° Economopoulos v. Kolaitis, 259
Va. 806, 528 S.E.2d 714, 719 (2000). A plaintiff cannot
satisfy the second prong where he has consented to the use
of the subject property. See Williams v. Reynolds, 2006 WL
3198968, at *3 (W.D. Va. 2006) (“ ‘[W]rongful exercise of
dominion or control’ cannot be established where the plaintiff
grants permission to the defendant to possess that property.”).
Indeed, Virginia has long recognized that implied consent is a

bar to conversion claims. See, e.g., Kewanee Private Utilities
Co. v. Norfolk Southern Ry. Co., 118 Va. 628, 88 S.E. 95, 99

(1916) lo, see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 252. The
question here is whether Toothman consented to Zurich's use

of his name and reputation.

During his deposition, Toothman acknowledged that he knew
Zurich needed the court's permission to designate him as
an expert in the Texas litigation. J.A. 380. Furthermore, in
an email to Dancy on November 8, 2010, he acknowledged
that he had been “named” before being retained. J.A. 245.
Nonetheless, he insists there is a difference between simply
being named by Zurich and being designated by it as an expert
in the Texas litigation.

This argument is unpersuasive. The manner in which
Zurich disclosed Toothman's name, whether in an email, a
court filing, discovery designation, or a telephone call is
immaterial. The fact remains Toothman knew that, in order
to obtain permission to designate him as an expert, Zurich
needed to disclose his name to the court and opposing counsel,
and he permitted such disclosure.

Moreover, despite having knowledge by at least December 8,
2010, that Zurich had disclosed his name, Toothman failed

to object until January 13, 2011. ""He disputes that he
did not promptly object, claiming that his email to Dancy
on December 8 *266 “expresses a lack of consent and
outright concern.” Appellants’ Reply Brief at 21 n. 11. We
are unpersuaded. Toothman's statement, “[n]aming me as a
witness before we were retained is likely to cause some issues
with Gardere and Voys,” J.A. 425, evinces his concern about
the effect disclosure of his name might have on his personal
interactions with two of the lawyers involved in the case, both
of whom he expected to see at an upcoming conference. It is
not evidence of lack of consent to the use of his name.

G.

Zurich is also entitled to summary judgment on Toothman's
claim that it infringed the copyright to his resume. The “fair
use” doctrine allows persons to use copyrighted material
in a reasonable manner without permission. Such use is
determined on a case-by-case basis, using the following four
factors set out in 17 U.S.C. § 107:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether
such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work.

In Bond v. Blum, 317 F.3d 385 (4th Cir. 2003), where a copy
of a manuscript had been used as evidence in a trial, we
noted that the “primary public purpose” of the Copyright Act
was “‘induc[ing] release to the public of the products of [the
author's or artist's] creative genius.” Id. at 393. Additionally,
we pointed out that “copyright protection does not extend to
ideas or facts even if such facts were discovered as the product
of long and hard work.” Id. at 394. After weighing the factors
of 18 U.S.C. § 107, we concluded that the defendant had
not used the manuscript for monetary gain, and that its use
had no negative impact on its marketability. Consequently,
we held that the use of the copyrighted manuscript in a court

proceeding fell within the ambit of fair use. Ie Id. at 395-97.

WESTLAW

The factors in Bond weigh heavily in favor of a finding
of fair use here. Toothman's resume employed no mode of
expression, but merely collected and restated known facts.
Zurich's use was not for profit or in a traditionally commercial
sense. Although reproduced in its entirety, Toothman's resume
“was not used to undermine any right conferred by the
Copyright Act.” Id. at 396. Finally, Zurich's use of the resume
did not affect its marketability. Unlike a manuscript, or other
copyrightable works consumers might actually purchase,
there is no market for Toothman's resume as such, nor have
Appellants credibly argued otherwise.

H.

Finally, we conclude that the district court did not abuse
its discretion in *267 denying as futile Appellants’ motion
to amend the complaint. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), the
directive to grant leave to amend freely is not simply a
suggestion, but rather a “mandate to be heeded.” Foman v.
Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).
Leave to amend should be denied “only when” there is the
presence of bad faith, futility, or prejudice to the opposing
party. See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 242
(4th Cir. 1999) (quoting Johnson v. Oroweat Foods Co., 785
F.2d 503, 509 (4th Cir. 1986)).

Although a district court possesses discretion to grant or
deny the opportunity to amend, “an outright refusal to grant
the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the
denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of
that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal
Rules.” Foman, 371 U.S. at 182, 83 S.Ct. 227; see also
Matrix Capital Mgmt. Fund LP v. BearingPoint Inc., 576 F.3d
172, 194 (4th Cir. 2009). Nevertheless, a detailed, explicit
explanation of the reasons for denying leave to amend is not
necessary when the reasons are evident. See Matrix Capital,
576 F.3d at 194.

When it denied Appellants’ motion to amend their complaint
to compensate for deficiencies in the counts dismissed,
the district court noted that “leave to amend would be
futile, because [Appellants’] proposed amendments to the
Complaint add no new facts that would allow [their] claims to
survive a motion to dismiss.” J.A. 714. Appellants’ attempt to

trademarks or copyrights, but denied it as to Toothman's name and reputation. J.A. 180-81. Subsequently,

Although Toothman repeatedly argues that his name is a property right, no one, including the district court,
has ever disputed this. For the purpose of our analysis here, we accept that courts may consider a name and
reputation as property but need not address whether the mere use of a name by another somehow deprives
the owner of its possession.

Other jurisdictions also have recognized implied consent as a bar to a conversion claim. See e.g., Bank of
N.Y. v. Fremont Gen. Corp., 523 F.3d 902, 914 (9th Cir. 2008); Chemical Sales Co., Inc. v. Diamond Chem.
Co., Inc., 766 F.2d 364, 369 (8th Cir. 1985); Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. Dearborn Title Corp., 904 F.Supp.
818, 821 n.2 (N.D. Ill. 1995).

Dancy's uncontroverted testimony is that Toothman actually knew from the very beginning of the negotiations
that Zurich had to disclose his name to the court as a condition precedent to Zurich's acceptance of the
contract.

Several of our sister circuits also have concluded that use of copyrighted material in court proceedings is fair
use. See e.g., Hollander v. Steinberg, 419 Fed.Appx. 44, 47—48 (2nd Cir. 2011) (affirming summary judgment
on fair use where attorney sued opposing counsel for filing his essays in a judicial proceeding); Jartech, Inc.
v. Clancy, 666 F.2d 403, 407 (9th Cir. 1982) (affirming fair use where adult films were copied for use in judicial
proceedings, were not made for subsequent use or enjoyment, and were not for commercial use); Shell v.
Devries, 2007 WL 324592 (D. Colo. Jan. 31, 2007) (finding fair use where a portion of a copyrighted website
was used as an exhibit to a motion for attorney's fees), aff'd 2007 WL 4269047 (10th Cir. 2007).

MEMORANDUM
Anita B. Brody, District Judge

*1 Plaintiff American Society for Testing and Materials d/b/
a ASTM International (“ASTM”) sues UpCodes, Inc. and its
founders Garrett Reynolds and Scott Reynolds (collectively,
“UpCodes”) for providing free online access to unauthorized
copies of ten copyrighted ASTM standards (referred to
as the “Copyrighted Standards”)—all of which have been
identically incorporated by reference into state and local legal
codes. ASTM alleges copyright and trademark infringement
and moves for a preliminary injunction. ECF No. 59. After
considering the parties’ filings and the arguments presented
at the August 26, 2024, preliminary injunction hearing, | find
that ASTM is unlikely to succeed on the merits, and I will

deny ASTM's motion. |

I. BACKGROUND”

A. The Parties
ASTM is a non-profit organization founded in 1898 and a
globally recognized leader in the development of technical
standards for various industries, products, and materials. P1.’s
Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 13.° Technical standards,
sometimes referred to as “voluntary consensus standards,”
are narrow, highly technical publications containing product
specifications and best practices “that bolster safety and

performance across industries.” Jd. ASTM develops these
standards to fulfill its mission of “positively impacting public
health and safety, consumer confidence, and overall quality of
life.” ECF No. 1 § 1. As a standard-developing organization,
ASTM provides a forum for its 30,000 members to produce
high-quality standards through a rigorous, multi-level review

process. * Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 13-14. All
ASTM standards are reviewed on a five-year schedule and
reapproved, revised, or withdrawn accordingly. Compl., ECF
No. 1 ¥ 15.

To fund this process, ASTM relies, in part, on revenue derived
from selling and licensing its thousands of copyrighted

standards.> Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 15. Over
seventy percent of ASTM's revenue comes from the sale of
its standards. Pl.’s Reply, ECF No. 76, at 12. In addition
to individual sales, ASTM sells a publication entitled ASTM
Standards in Building Codes that contains over 13,000 ASTM

standards including the ten Copyrighted Standards at issue. 6

See Pl.’s Reply, ECF No. 76, at 12.

*2 Although local, state, and federal jurisdictions reference
ASTM standards in their laws, it is accepted that ASTM does
not lobby the government—or other entities—to reference
their standards. Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 16-17.
However, ASTM's official form and style manual indicates
that certain ASTM standards are “developed for reference
in model building codes.” Defs.” Mem. P. & A., ECF No.
68, at 11 (alteration omitted). Also, ASTM may derive new
benefits when other entities reference ASTM standards. For
example, when ASTM standards are adopted into law, ASTM
can market its own compliance-focused training materials.
See Amicus Br. Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. Supp.
Defs.’ Opp'n Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 71-1, at 22-23 (citing
Environmental Training, ASTM Int'l, http://environment.qa-
training.astm.org/#/).

UpCodes is a for-profit start-up company founded by brothers
Garrett and Scott Reynolds in 2016. Defs.’ Mem. P. & A.,
ECF No. 68, at 9. Frustrated by the lack of free electronic
access to state and local laws governing architecture projects,
the Reynolds brothers created UpCodes with the mission
of facilitating public access to laws governing the built
environment. See Reynolds Decl. {5-9 (available at ECF No.
66-14) (“UpCodes’ goal is to offer ... a free, online, accurate,
up-to-date, extensive library of building codes and standards

WESTLAW

as enacted into law.”’). UpCodes’ stated policy is “to publish
only the law” on its website. Defs.” Mem. P. & A., ECF No.
68, at 9. Pursuant to this policy, UpCodes only publishes
standards that, in their view, have been adopted into law by
specific jurisdictions. Jd. When searching on the UpCodes
website, users can filter their searches by jurisdiction or by
the original publisher of the adopted standard. /d. at 10.

In general, UpCodes employs a “freemium” business model,
offering users basic products for free and premium products
for a fee. Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 18. Under this
model, any user with an UpCodes account can view and copy
a supported jurisdiction's laws free of charge on the UpCodes

website. ’ Defs.’ Mem. P. & A., ECF No. 68, at 9. Users can
also purchase a subscription to access UpCodes’ premium
features, including bookmarking, annotating, and automation
tools. Reynolds Decl. 4 12 (available at ECF No. 66-14).
Thus, UpCodes does not derive direct monetary profit when
users access private standards on the UpCodes website. Defs.’
Resp. Mem., ECF No. 47, at 11. However, posting these
standards may provide UpCodes with tangential benefits
like drawing users to its website, increasing active account
numbers, and enabling the collection of user information. See
Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 18; Pl.’s Reply, ECF No.
76, at 10.

In April 2024, UpCodes posted copies of ASTM's
Copyrighted Standards to the UpCodes website without

ASTM's authorization. ® Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF ECF No.
62, at 17. After registering for an UpCodes account, free
users can view and copy the Copyrighted Standards and
premium users can use UpCodes’ paid services to search,
annotate, and bookmark the Copyrighted Standards. PI.’s
Reply, ECF No. 76, at 10. On its website, UpCodes does not
display the ASTM logo, but it identifies ASTM as the original
publisher of the Copyrighted Standards. See Tr. Oral Arg.,
ECF No. 96, at 69:13-14; Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at
17. Since promulgating the standards, ASTM has published
updated versions of nine of the ten Copyrighted Standards that
UpCodes displays on its website. Defs.” Mem. P. & A., ECF

force of law in one or more jurisdictions.” /d. at 20 § 17.
One such jurisdiction is the City of Philadelphia, where
the Philadelphia Building Code indirectly incorporates by

reference the Copyrighted Standards. °

B. Incorporation By Reference
The Philadelphia Building Code establishes “minimum
requirements to provide a reasonable level of safety” in
building construction projects. Phila. Code ch. 4-200 §
B-101.3. If individuals violate the Philadelphia Building
Code or “any regulation adopted under it,” they can face fines
of up to three hundred dollars a day per offense for each day
the violation continues. Phila. Code ch. 1-100 § 1-109(1).
When the City of Philadelphia enacted this code, it did not

develop the content of the code itself. 10 Instead, Philadelphia
engaged in a practice that has become increasingly common
among federal, state, and local governments: incorporation by
reference.

When a government entity incorporates a standard by
reference, it references—but does not reprint—a standard

already published elsewhere. ""Asa result, the incorporated
standard may be enforced against regulated entities without
being included in the text of the law itself. When this
happens, a regulated entity will not find the text of the
standard that details their legal obligations in the official

public code. RD They must look elsewhere to access the
content of the standard. Often, that access comes with a price.
The private standard-developing organizations that create

these referenced standards typically copyright their work and

charge fees for users to access them. 1s

*4 This practice has benefits and drawbacks. On one hand,
governments save substantial resources by incorporating
privately authored standards instead of investing to develop

standards themselves. !* The public may also gain from
private sector expertise and creativity, especially given the
“vast, predominately private standardization system” that

already exists within the United States. 1s

On the other hand, incorporation by reference may

create serious notice and accountability problems. 16 Most
obviously, placing legally binding standards behind paywalls
undermines the “principle that [government] should provide

WESTLAW

regulated parties fair warning of the conduct [a regulation]
prohibits or requires.” Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham
Corp., 567 U.S. 142, 156, 132 S.Ct. 2156, 183 L.Ed.2d
153 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally,
“as with governmental contracting and other outsourcing
decisions,” incorporation by reference reduces government
transparency and may hinder mechanisms of democratic
accountability that are important to deter government
arbitrariness, to safeguard against industry “capture” or the
undue influence of particular subgroups, and to prevent
decision-making based on undisclosed data or inadequate or

biased information. !”

C. Indirect Incorporation By Reference

Governments also reference privately authored standards
indirectly. At issue in this case is a method of indirect
incorporation-by-reference that involves an additional layer
of incorporation by a third party. See Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF
No. 62, at 16 (referring to this as a “third-party reference”).
This occurs in two steps. A government incorporates by
reference a third party's publication that, in turn, incorporates
by reference a separate privately authored standard. In
other words, the legislature references—but does not reprint
—some third party's publication. And that third party's
publication references—but does not reprint—the governing
technical standard.

In a nutshell, direct incorporation consists of only one jump:
a jump from the text of the law to the privately authored
standard. By contrast, indirect incorporation consists of
two jumps: one jump from the text of the law to a third
party's publication, and another jump from the third party's

publication to the privately authored standard. In neither case
is the content of the technical standard reprinted in the text of
the law itself. Thus, people are typically unable to view the
content of these standards unless they pay a fee.

D. Philadelphia's Indirect Reference to ASTM's
Copyrighted Standards
All ten of ASTM's Copyrighted Standards are incorporated
by reference into the Philadelphia Building Code through the
same mechanism of indirect incorporation.

ASTM developed, authored, and copyrighted ten technical
standards relating to the steel and aluminum used in building


--- Page 4 ---

American Society for Testing and Materials v. UpCodes, Inc., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

construction. See Compl., Ex. A, ECF No. 1-1 (listing the
Copyrighted Standards). A third-party publication, the 2018
International Building Code (referred to as “IBC”) directly
incorporates by reference all ten of ASTM's Copyrighted
Standards. See 2018 Int'l Bldg. Code, ch 35 (available at
Ex. 2., ECF No. 66-3). The IBC is a copyrighted work
published by a third party—the International Code Council,
Inc. (referred to as “ICC”), another standard-developing

organization. 18 Compl., ECF No. 1 30.

*5 The IBC explicitly instructs that any privately authored

standards it references should be considered part of the
IBC itself. As the IBC's Chapter on Referenced Standards
explains, “[t]he International Building Code® contains
numerous references to standards promulgated by other
organizations that are used to provide requirements for
materials and methods of construction .... These standards, in
essence, are part of this code to the extent of the reference
to the standard.” 2018 Int'l Bldg. Code, ch 35 (available at
Ex. 2, ECF No. 66-3, at 2) (emphasis added). Thus, ASTM's
Copyrighted Standards “provide requirements for materials
and methods of construction” that are considered “part of” the
IBC. Id.

The Philadelphia Building Code, in turn, directly incorporates
by reference the IBC. See Phila. Code ch. 4-200 § B-1.1
(‘The ‘2018 International Building Code’ as published
by the International Code Council is hereby adopted as
the Philadelphia Building Code ....”). Like the IBC, the
Philadelphia Building Code explicitly instructs that the
material it incorporates by reference should be considered
part of the Philadelphia Building Code itself. As stated in the

Philadelphia Building Code, the IBC “is incorporated as if

fully set forth herein, subject to [ ] local amendments.” Jd.
§ B-1.2 (available at Ex. 3, ECF No. 66-4, at 18) (emphasis
added). Thus, the IBC, which makes ASTM's Copyrighted

Standards, “in essence, part of’ the IBC, 19 is incorporated
into the Philadelphia Building Code “as if fully set forth” in

the enacted law itself. 7°

Through these two layers of incorporation, the Philadelphia
Building Code indirectly references all ten of ASTM's
Copyrighted Standards. And UpCodes published copies of
the Copyrighted Standards because of this incorporation by
reference.

WESTLAW

Il. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

ASTM filed this lawsuit alleging seven claims against
UpCodes. Count I asserts direct copyright infringement.
Count II asserts vicarious and/or contributory copyright
infringement. Count III asserts alteration or removal of
copyright management information. Count IV asserts federal
trademark infringement. Count V asserts claims of unfair
competition and false designation of origin. Count VI asserts
trademark infringement under Pennsylvania common law.
Count VII asserts dilution of trademarks under Pennsylvania
statutory law. ECF No. 1.

On May 3, 2024, ASTM moved for a preliminary injunction.
ECF No. 6. In its revised motion, ASTM requests that
UpCodes be preliminarily enjoined from:

a. Further unauthorized reproduction of all or any non-
de minimis portion of ASTM's Copyrighted Works and
any other standards or materials published by ASTM,
preparation of derivative works based on ASTM's
Copyrighted Works or on any standards or materials
published by ASTM, and distribution or display of
copies of the Infringing Materials or any standards or
materials published by ASTM by any means or method;

b. Further alteration or removal of ASTM's copyright
management information and all further distribution,
importation, or public performance of the Altered
Works;

c. Selling, offering for sale, distributing, or advertising any
electronic or hard copies of standards under ASTM's
Mark, or any marks substantially indistinguishable
therefrom, which are likely to cause confusion or to
cause mistake or to deceive persons into the erroneous
belief that any standards that Defendants caused to enter
the stream of commerce or any of UpCodes’ commercial
activities are sponsored or licensed or approved by
ASTM, or are connected or affiliated in some with
ASTM or ASTM's Mark;

*6 d. Implying ASTM's approval, endorsement, or
sponsorship of, or affiliation or connection with,
Defendants’ products, services, or commercial activities,
passing off Defendants’ copies of standards as that
of ASTM, or engaging in any act or series of acts
which, either alone or in combination, constitutes

unfair methods of competition with ASTM and from
otherwise interfering with or injuring ASTM's Mark or
the goodwill associated therewith; or

e. Representing or implying that Defendant UpCodes is
in any way sponsored by, currently affiliated with, or
licensed by ASTM.

ECF No. 59, at 1-2. UpCodes agreed to not post additional
ASTM standards while ASTM's preliminary injunction
motion is pending. Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 18.
However, if permitted, UpCodes intends to continue posting
ASTM standards that jurisdictions incorporate by reference
into law. See id.

HI. LEGAL STANDARD

In deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction, a
district court should balance the following four factors so
long as the moving party meets the requisite showing on the
first two: (1) the movant has shown a likelihood of success
on the merits; (2) the movant will suffer irreparable harm in
the absence of a preliminary injunction; (3) the possibility
of harm to other interested persons from a grant or denial of

the injunction; and (4) the public interest. Reilly v. City of

Harrisburg, 858 F.3d 173, 176 (3d Cir. 2017). Accordingly,

a movant for preliminary equitable
relief must meet the threshold for the
first two “most critical” factors: it
must demonstrate that it can win on
the merits (which requires a showing
significantly better than negligible but
not necessarily more likely than not)
and that it is more likely than not
to suffer irreparable harm in the
absence of preliminary relief. If these
gateway factors are met, a court then
considers the remaining two factors
and determines in its sound discretion
if all four factors, taken together,
balance in favor of granting the
requested preliminary relief.

Id. at 179 (footnotes omitted).

WESTLAW

“{BJurdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the
burdens at trial.” Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente
Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 163
L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006). Thus, once the moving party establishes
“a prima facie case showing a reasonable probability that it
will prevail on the merits,” /MC Corp. v. Control Solutions,
Inc., 369 F. Supp. 2d 539, 555 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (quoting
Oburn vy. Shapp, 521 F.2d 142, 148 (3d Cir. 1975)), the burden
shifts to the non-moving party to show a likelihood that any
affirmative defense will succeed. See id. at 553 (applying
this burden-shifting standard to affirmative defenses in a
copyright infringement action).

IV. DISCUSSION

Because ASTM is not likely to succeed on the merits of its
copyright or trademark claims, the Court will deny the motion
for preliminary injunction.

A. Copyright Claims
ASTM alleges that UpCodes infringed on ASTM's federally

registered copyrights in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 501.7! As
discussed below, ASTM has demonstrated a prima facie case
of copyright infringement. Nonetheless, ASTM's copyright
claims must fail because UpCodes successfully establishes

the affirmative defense of fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107. 22

1. ASTM's Prima Facie Case of Copyright Infringement

*7 ASTM successfully establishes a prima facie case of
copyright infringement. The Copyright Act confers “a bundle
of exclusive rights” to the authors of original works. Harper
& Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539,
546, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (describing 17
U.S.C. § 106). To establish a claim of infringement under the
Copyright Act, a plaintiff must show (1) the ownership of
a valid copyright and (2) defendant's unauthorized copying
of original elements of the plaintiffs work. See Tanksley v.
Daniels, 902 F.3d 165, 172-73 (3d Cir. 2018). “Copying”
occurs when a defendant infringes on any of a copyright

owner's five exclusive rights, 23 including the rights to
reproduce and distribute copyrighted material. See Ford

Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

American Society for Testing and Materials v. UpCodes, Inc., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

Motor Co. v. Summit Motor Prod., Inc., 930 F. 2d 277, 291
(3d Cir. 1991).

ASTM establishes both elements of a copyright infringement
claim for all ten of the Copyrighted Standards.

First, ASTM's copyrights are presumed valid because each
of the Copyrighted Standards’ certificates of registration was
“made before or within five years” of the “first publication”
of the corresponding standard. 17 U.S.C. § 410(c); see
Silvertop Associates Inc. v. Kangaroo Manufacturing Inc.,
931 F.3d 215, 219 n.3 (3d Cir. 2019) (“Registering a work's
copyright within five years of the work's first publication
entitles the holder to a presumption of validity.”); Exs. 2-11,
O'Brien Decl., ECF No. 7 (showing that all ten certificates
of registration were made before or within five years of the
corresponding standard's first publication).

Second, by publishing unauthorized copies of the
Copyrighted Standards on the UpCodes website, UpCodes
plainly infringed on ASTM's exclusive rights to “reproduce
the copyrighted work” and “distribute copies ... of the
copyrighted work to the public ....” 17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1),
106(3). Satisfying both elements, ASTM has established a
prima facie case of copyright infringement.

2. UpCodes’ Fair Use Defense

UpCodes contests neither the presumptive validity of ASTM's
copyrights under 17 U.S.C. § 410(c) nor the fact that UpCodes
copied ASTM's standards without authorization. See PI.’s
Reply, ECF No. 76, at 13. Instead, UpCodes argues that its
unauthorized copying is permissible because it is fair use
under 17 U.S.C. § 107. For the reasons set forth below, I
find that UpCodes’ copying is fair use and ASTM's copyright
claims therefore fail.

Fair use is an affirmative defense to copyright infringement.
See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 590,
114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994). As codified in
the Copyright Act, “the fair use of a copyrighted work ...
for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,
teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use),
scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.”
17 U.S.C. § 107. Fair-use analysis is highly fact-intensive

WESTLAW

and “requires a case-by-case determination” of whether a
particular use is fair. Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 549, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588
(1985).

*8 In determining whether the use of a copyrighted work is
fair, courts consider the following non-exclusive factors: (1)
the purpose and character of the use, including whether such
use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational
purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the
amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon
the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 17
U.S.C. § 107. The factors should not be “treated in isolation”
but instead should “all be explored[ ] and the results weighed
together, in light of the purposes of copyright,” described
below. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577-78, 114 S.Ct. 1164.

Copyright exists “[t]o promote the [p]rogress of [s]cience
and useful [a]rts,” U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 8, and this
“goal of enriching public knowledge” is accomplished by
incentivizing private creativity. Andy Warhol Foundation
for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508, 531,
143 S.Ct. 1258, 215 L.Ed.2d 473 (2023) (quoting Authors
Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202, 214 (2d Cir. 2015)). In
other words, the Copyright Act confers to authors a “limited
monopoly” over copyrighted works “in order to give the
public appropriate access to their work product.” Sony Corp.
of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417,

429, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984). a4 Through the
copyright regime, “[c]reative work is to be encouraged and
rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the
cause of promoting broad public availability of literature,
music, and the other arts.” Twentieth Century Music Corp.
yv. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 156, 95 S.Ct. 2040, 45 L.Ed.2d 84
(1975). The fair use analysis must be evaluated according to
this objective.

Turning to the factors, I find that—read together in light of
the purposes of copyright—the factors indicate that UpCodes’
copying of ASTM's Copyrighted Standards is fair use.
Because all ten Copyrighted Standards were incorporated-by-

reference into law in an identical manner through the IBC, 25

the analysis of each fair use factor applies identically to all
ten standards.

American Society for Testing and Materials v. UpCodes, Inc., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

i. The purpose and character of the use

The first fair use factor is “the purpose and character of the
use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or
is for nonprofit educational purposes.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(1).
This factor “considers the reasons for, and nature of, the
copier's use of an original work.” Andy Warhol Foundation
for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508, 528, 143
S.Ct. 1258, 215 L.Ed.2d 473 (2023). In assessing this factor,
courts conduct an “objective inquiry” into two elements of
the copier's use: (i) whether and to what extent copier's
use is “transformative,” and (ii) whether the copier's use
is commercial in nature. /d. at 545, 532, 143 S.Ct. 1258.
These two elements must be balanced against each other, as
described below. /d. at 532-33, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

*9 The first element is transformative use. Transformative
use exists when a use “has a further purpose or different
character” from the original. /d. at 529, 143 S.Ct. 1258.
Although transformative use is not necessary for finding fair
use, it weighs heavily in favor of fair use and “the more
transformative the new work, the less will be the significance
of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against
a finding of fair use.” Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510
USS. 569, 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994).

Whether and to what extent a use is transformative “relates
to the justification for the use.” Goldsmith, 598 U.S. at 531,
143 S.Ct. 1258. “[A] use that has a distinct purpose is justified
because it furthers the goal of copyright, namely, to promote
the progress of science and the arts, without diminishing the
incentive to create.” /d. The more the copier uses copied
material for transformative purposes, “the more it serves
copyright's goal of enriching public knowledge” and the less
likely it is that copying will merely “serve as a substitute for
the original ....” /d. (quoting Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at 214).

A transformative use may also be justified because “copying
is reasonably necessary to achieve the user's new purpose.”
Id. at 532, 143 S.Ct. 1258. For example, “[p]arody needs
to mimic an original to make its point.” Campbell, 510
USS. at 580-81, 114 S.Ct. 1164. This kind of “independent
justification” is “particularly relevant to assessing fair use
where ... wide dissemination of a secondary work would

otherwise run the risk of substitution for the original or

WESTLAW

licensed derivatives of it.” Goldsmith, 598 U.S. at 532, 143
S.Ct. 1258.

Finally, “in various circumstances, courts have recognized
that a secondary work can be transformative in function or
purpose without altering or actually adding to the original
work.” ASTM, et al. v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 896 F.3d
437, 450 (D.C. Cir. 2018); see also A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye
vy. iParadigms, LLC, 562 F.3d 630, 639 (4th Cir. 2009)
(“The use of a copyrighted work need not alter or augment
the work to be transformative in nature. Rather, it can be
transformative in function or purpose without altering or
actually adding to the original work.”). For example, news
reporters must “faithfully reproduce an original work without
alteration,” but “a reporter's message (‘this is what they said’)
is very different from the original message (‘this is what you
should believe’),” so the use is still transformative. ASTM
v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 82 F.4th 1262, 1268 (D.C. Cir.
2023) (describing Swatch Group Management Services Ltd.
v. Bloomberg L.P., 756 F.3d 73, 85 (2d Cir. 2014)).

The other element of the first factor is commercial use. “There
is no doubt that a finding that copying was not commercial
in nature tips the scales in favor of fair use.” Google LLC v.
Oracle America, Inc., 593 U.S. 1, 32, 141 S.Ct. 1183, 209
L.Ed.2d 311 (2021). However, “the inverse is not necessarily
true,” and the mere fact that a copier's use was commercial
does not necessarily weigh against fair use. /d. Rather,
“many common fair uses are indisputably commercial.” Jd.
For example, § 107 of the Copyright Act includes, as a
paradigmatic example of fair use, “news reporting,” “which
is often done for commercial profit.” /d. (quoting 17 U.S.C.
§ 107).

Ultimately, the two elements of the first factor—
commercialism and transformative use—balance against each
other. The commercial nature of a copier's use must be
“weighed against the degree to which the use has a further
purpose or different character.” Goldsmith, 598 U.S. at 531,
143 S.Ct. 1258. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 569, 114 S.Ct.
1164 (“[T]he more transformative the new work, the less will
be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that

may weigh against a finding of fair use.”).

*10 Applying these principles, the first factor supports
a finding that UpCodes’ copying was fair use because
UpCodes’ use is non-commercial and transformative.

For Educational Use Only

American Society for Testing and Materials v. UpCodes, Inc., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

UpCodes is a for-profit company, but its use of the
Copyrighted Standards is largely noncommercial. UpCodes
makes the Copyrighted Standards available on its website
for free. And although UpCodes may receive tangential
benefits from its copying, it derives no direct monetary profit
from publishing the Copyrighted Standards. See Facility
Guidelines Institute, Inc. v. UpCodes, Inc., 677 F. Supp. 3d
955, 971 (E.D. Mo. 2023) (finding that UpCodes’ secondary
use is “largely of a non-commercial nature” and “[t]he benefit
to the public of free access to the law exceeds the monetary
benefit UpCodes’ may eventually receive”). UpCodes is a

commercial actor, but “‘[a] commercial actor's dissemination
of information to the public may be a transformative use.”
International Code Council, Inc. v. UpCodes, Inc., No.
17-6261, 2020 WL 2750636, at *25 (S.D.N.Y. May 27,
2020) (citing Swatch, 756 F.3d at 84-85). And UpCodes’
transformative use outweighs the significance of the fact that
it is a for-profit company—especially given that UpCodes’
does not directly profit from its use of the Copyrighted
Standards.

UpCodes’ use is transformative because it “has a further
purpose or different character” than ASTM's Copyrighted
Standards. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. at 529, 143 S.Ct. 1258.
By posting the Copyrighted Standards, UpCodes achieves
the distinct objective of making the law freely accessible
and educating the public on the contents of binding laws.
Unlike ASTM, UpCodes seeks neither to publish industry
best practices nor to “positively impact[ ] public health
and safety” by developing high-quality technical standards.
Compl., ECF No. | §j 1. Rather, UpCodes’ use of the
Copyrighted Standards serves the purpose of “offer[ing] ...
a free, online ... library of building codes and standards as
enacted into law.” Reynolds Decl. 9 (available at ECF
No. 66-14). This use has a different character and further
purpose from ASTM's use, and thus, is transformative.
Cf. International Code Council, Inc., 2020 WL 2750636,
at *25 (finding UpCodes’ disseminating enacted laws for
public awareness “clearly serves a transformative purpose”);
Facility Guidelines Institute, Inc., 677 F. Supp. 3d at 971
(same).

ASTM contends that UpCodes and ASTM share the
same purpose: “providing [ ] information to [architecture,
engineering, and construction] professionals,” but this
characterization ignores the difference between (i) UpCodes’

WESTLAW

objective of posting standards that have been enacted into
law and (ii) ASTM's objective of publishing standards that
“bolster safety and performance across industries.” PI.’s
Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 27, 13. In a case brought
by ASTM and other standard-developing organizations
against Public Resource, a non-profit organization that shares
UpCodes’ mission of making the law freely accessible, the
D.C. Circuit found this distinction to be “fundamental.”
ASTM vy. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 82 F.4th 1262, 1268
(D.C. Cir. 2023). The D.C. Circuit found that, like UpCodes,
“Public Resource's use is transformative because it serves
a different purpose than the plaintiffs’ works.” Jd. at 1267.
The plaintiffs in the D.C. case sought “to advance science
and industry by producing standards reflecting industry or
engineering best practices,” but the D.C. Circuit found that,
like UpCodes, “Public Resource's mission in republishing the
standards is very different—to provide the public with a free
and comprehensive repository of the law.” /d. at 1268. Thus,
even though ASTM and UpCodes both provide information to
the architecture, engineering, and construction communities,
UpCodes’ secondary use of the Copyrighted Standards serves
a distinct purpose.

*11 One “objective indic[ation]”*° that UpCodes’ use

serves a distinct purpose is that ASTM subsequently
published updated versions of nine of the ten Copyrighted
Standards, and UpCodes does not post updated versions of
those standards. See Defs.” Mem. P. & A., ECF No. 68, at
33. If UpCodes shared ASTM's objective of “bolster[ing]
safety and performance across industries” by publishing

standards reflecting best industry practices, ~” then it would
be reasonable to assume that UpCodes would publish ASTM's
most up-to-date versions of the ten standards. But UpCodes
does not post the most up-to-date versions of the standards.
Instead, UpCodes only posts the versions of the Copyrighted
Standards that the IBC made binding in 2018. This is because
UpCodes seeks to provide access to standards that have been
enacted into law—not to provide access to standards that
reflect the latest industry best practices. Thus, UpCodes’ use
serves a distinct purpose from ASTM's use, and UpCodes’
use is transformative.

UpCodes’ transformative use is also justified for two
reasons. See Goldsmith, 598 U.S. at 531, 143 S.Ct. 1258
(‘[T]he first factor also relates to the justification for the
use.”). First, UpCodes’ purpose of providing free access

to the law is “justified because it furthers the goall[s]
of copyright,’ including “enriching public knowledge.”
Jd. (citation omitted). As the Southern District of New
York recognized, UpCodes’ “purpose of educating the
(architecture, engineering, and construction] community
and public at large about their legal obligations
seems consistent with illustrative purposes articulated in
the Copyright Act, including teaching, scholarship, and
research.” International Code Council, Inc., 2020 WL
2750636, at *24.

Additionally, UpCodes’ use is “justified because copying is
reasonably necessary to achieve [UpCodes’] new purpose.”
Goldsmith, 598 U.S. at 532, 143 S.Ct. 1258. To disseminate
the law and educate the public about their legal obligations,
UpCodes must post the actual text of the Copyrighted
Standards. As UpCodes explained, “[i]f [it] attempted
to express that law using other words ... it would not
be publishing the law of Philadelphia.” Defs.’ Mem. P.
& A., ECF No. 68, at 22; see also ASTM, et al. v.
Public.Resource. Org, Inc., 896 F.3d 437, 450 (D.C. Cir. 2018)
(agreeing that “[p]araphrases, summaries, and descriptions ...

do not capture the precision that is necessary to understand
the legal obligations that governments impose and enforce”).
On this basis, the D.C. Circuit found that, “[w]here an
incorporated standard provides information essential to
comprehending one's legal duties,” the first fair use factor
“weigh[s] heavily in favor of permitting a nonprofit seeking
to inform the public about the law to reproduce in full the
relevant portions of that particular standard.” /d.

ASTM argues that the D.C. Circuit's conclusion is
inapplicable here for two reasons, both of which are
unconvincing. First, ASTM emphasizes that UpCodes is
a for-profit company, not a non-profit. But, as described
above, UpCodes’ use of the Copyrighted Standards is
largely noncommercial. Because UpCodes’ use provides free
access to the Copyrighted Standards, UpCodes—like Public
Resource—is permitted to reproduce in full the relevant
portions of standards that have been incorporated by reference
into law. ASTM also contends that UpCodes posts portions
of the Copyrighted Standards that include explanatory notes,
supplementary materials, and appendices. And ASTM argues
that these materials are not essential to complying with any
legal duty. See Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 28.
However, as the D.C. Circuit explained, “because law is
interpreted contextually, even explanatory and background

WESTLAW

material will aid in understanding and interpreting legal
duties” and, like legislative history, such materials “may
prove [ ] important for resolving ambiguities in the portions of
standards that set forth the directly binding legal obligations.”
ASTM y. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 82 F.4th 1262, 1269-70
(D.C. Cir. 2023). Thus, posting the Copyrighted Standards in
their entirety is reasonably necessary to UpCodes’ purpose
of educating the public about how to satisfy their legal
obligations, and therefore, is justified.

*12 Finally, UpCodes’ use is “transformative in function
or purpose” even “without altering or adding to” the
Copyrighted Standards. A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye v. iParadigms,
LLC, 562 F.3d 630, 639 (4th Cir. 2009). As multiple courts
have recognized, “[p]osting enacted laws for the purpose of
educating members of the public as to their legal obligations
may be transformative, even if the enacted laws are identical
to other copyrighted works.” Jnternational Code Council,
Inc., 2020 WL 2750636, at *24 (holding the same); see
also Facility Guidelines Institute, Inc., 677 F. Supp. 3d at
970 (same); ASTM, 896 F.3d at 450 (same). Like a news
reporter that must “faithfully reproduce an original work
without alteration,” UpCodes must faithfully reproduce the
Copyrighted Standards without alteration to report what the
law is in jurisdictions like Philadelphia. ASTM, 82 F.4th
at 1268. But, like a news reporter, UpCodes’ message “is
very different from the original message,” and thus serves a
transformative purpose. /d.

In sum, because UpCodes’ use is transformative and largely
noncommercial, the first factor weighs in favor of fair use.

ii. The nature of the copyrighted work

The second factor is “the nature of the copyrighted work,” 17
U.S.C. § 107(2), and courts often reduce this inquiry into the
question of whether a work is factual (weighing in favor of
fair use) or fictional (weighing against fair use). See Harper
& Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539,
563, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985).

The factor recognizes that “some works are closer to the core
of intended copyright protection than others,” and “fair use is
more difficult to establish when the former works are copied.”
Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 586, 114


--- Page 10 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

American Society for Testing and Materials v. UpCodes, Inc., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994). Thus, because “[t]he
law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual
works than works of fiction or fantasy,” the second factor
weighs in favor of fair use when a work falls on the factual
end of the fact-fiction spectrum. Harper & Row Publishers,
Inc., 471 U.S. at 563, 105 S.Ct. 2218.

Applying these principles, the second factor strongly supports
a finding that UpCodes’ copying was fair use. As the
D.C. Circuit explained, technical standards generally “fall
at the factual end of the fact-fiction spectrum, which
counsels in favor of finding fair use.” ASTM, et al. v.
Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 896 F.3d 437, 451 (D.C. Cir.
2018). And because “the express text of the law falls plainly
outside the realm of copyright protection,” id. (citing Banks
vy. Manchester, 128 U.S. 244, 253, 9 S.Ct. 36, 32 L.Ed. 425
(1888)), “standards incorporated by reference into law are, at
best, at the outer edge of ‘copyright's protective purposes,’ ”
id. (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586, 114. S.Ct. 1164). Thus,
“[w]here the consequence of the incorporation by reference
is virtually indistinguishable from a situation in which the
standard had been expressly copied into law, this factor
weighs heavily in favor of fair use.” /d. at 452.

The nature of the ASTM's Copyrighted Standards weighs
heavily in favor of fair use. Although ASTM invests
significant time and resources to develop its technical
standards, the Copyrighted Standards are factual—they
relate to steel and aluminum used in building construction.
Additionally, the ten Copyrighted Standards have been
incorporated into law so that the consequence is “virtually
indistinguishable” from a situation in which they had been
expressly copied into the enacting legislation itself. /d. In
a jurisdiction like Philadelphia, an individual who fails to
conform to the Copyrighted Standards is subject to penalty
as if the requirement had been reprinted in the Philadelphia
Building Code itself. Thus, ASTM's Copyrighted Standards
—having been incorporated by reference into law—fall at the
outer edge of copyright's protective purposes, and the second
factor weighs in favor of fair use.

iii. The amount and substantiality of the portion used

*13 The third factor is “the amount and substantiality of
the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a

WESTLAW

whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). This factor recognizes that “the
extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and
character of the use.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586-87, 114 S.Ct.
1164. The test for this factor is largely one of reasonableness
—courts ask whether the amount and substantiality of the
portion used is “reasonable in relation to the purpose of the
copying.” /d. at 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Reproducing an entire
work normally militates against finding fair use, but the nature
of the copyrighted work can justify wholesale copying. See
Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464
U.S. 417, 449-50, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984).
And the Supreme Court has instructed that this factor “will
generally weigh in favor of fair use” when “the amount of
copying was tethered to a valid, and transformative, purpose.”
Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc., 593 U.S. 1,34, 141 8.Ct.
1183, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021).

Applying these principles, the third factor supports a finding
of fair use. UpCodes copied the entirety of ASTM's
Copyrighted Standards, but this amount of copying was
plainly reasonable in relation to UpCodes’ objective. As the
analysis of the first factor demonstrates, UpCodes’ use serves
a valid, transformative purpose: to disseminate the law and
educate the public about their legal obligations. And because
jurisdictions like Philadelphia incorporated the entirety of
the Copyrighted Standards into their law, it is “reasonably
necessary” for UpCodes to copy the entirety of Copyrighted
Standards “to achieve [its] new purpose” of educating the
public about their legal obligations. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. at
532, 143 S.Ct. 1258. Thus, the amount and substantiality of
UpCodes’ copying is “tethered” to UpCodes’ transformative
purpose, Google LLC, 593 U.S. at 34, 141 S.Ct. 1183, and the
factor weighs in favor of fair use.

The D.C. Circuit concluded similarly, holding that the third
factor “strongly supports fair use because the standards at
issue have been incorporated and thus have the force of
law.” ASTM v. Public.Resource. Org, Inc., 82 F.4th 1262, 1269
(D.C. Cir. 2023). As the Court explained, if the government
“has given legal effect to an entire standard, then [the
standard's] entire reproduction is reasonable in relation to the
purpose of the copying, which is to provide the public with a
free and comprehensive repository of the law.” /d. Like Public
Resource, UpCodes provides a free online repository of the
law. Thus, UpCodes’ entire reproduction of the Copyrighted
Standards is reasonable in relation to this purpose.

Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025

American Society for Testing and Materials v. UpCodes, Inc., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

For this factor to weigh “strongly” in favor a fair use,
a defendant must “limit{ ] its copying to only what is
required to fairly describe the standard's legal import ....”
ASTM, et al. v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 896 F.3d 437,
452 (D.C. Cir. 2018). This qualification was especially
important in the D.C. case, where the hundreds of standards

at issue varied in their method of incorporation. ~° When
an incorporating law required compliance with only two
specific provisions of a privately authored code, the D.C.
Circuit reasoned that a defendant would have to limit its
copying to those two provisions for it to be fair use. ASTM,
et al., 896 F.3d at 452. By contrast, when an incorporating
law required compliance with an entire ASTM standard, the
Court concluded that “a greater amount of the standard's
text might be fairly reproduced.” /d. (discussing a labeling
requirement for biodiesel that simply “meets ASTM D975
diesel specifications”).

*14 Philadelphia requires compliance with entire ASTM
standards, so a greater amount of the standards’ text may
be fairly reproduced. The IBC (as adopted by jurisdictions
like Philadelphia) does not specify which provisions of
the Copyrighted Standards are binding. It simply lists, for
example, “A252-10” as one of the many standards that
“provide requirements” for the IBC. See 2018 Int'l Bldg.
Code, ch 35 (available at Ex. 2, ECF No. 66-3, at 2-3).
The incorporation of the Copyrighted Standards neither
“specif[ies] that only certain provisions of the standards
are incorporated by reference into law,” nor “indicate[s]
which specific provisions of the standards relate to regulatory
compliance ....” ASTM v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 597 F.
Supp. 3d 213, 237 (D.D.C. 2022). Thus, the entirety of the
Copyrighted Standards is “required to fairly describe the
standard's legal import,” ASTM, et al., 896 F.3d at 452, and
UpCodes’ entire reproduction of the standards is reasonable.

ASTM argues that UpCodes’ wholesale copying is
unreasonable because UpCodes copied portions of the
Copyrighted Standards that ASTM describes as “expressly
non-mandatory,” such as explanatory notes, supplementary
materials, and appendices. Pl.’s Reply, ECF No. 76, at 29.

However, as explained in the analysis of factor one, these
materials “aid in understanding and interpreting legal duties,”
and “may prove [ ] important for resolving ambiguities in the
portions of standards that set forth the directly binding legal

WESTLAW

obligations.” ASTM, 82 F.4th at 1269-70. Thus, UpCodes’
inclusion of these materials is reasonable.

In sum, the amount and substantiality of the Copyrighted
Standards used by UpCodes is reasonable in relation to
UpCodes’ valid and transformative purpose, and the third
factor weighs in favor of fair use. Cf’ Facility Guidelines
Institute, Inc. v. UpCodes, Inc., 677 F. Supp. 3d 955, 972
(E.D. Mo. 2023) (“UpCodes has copied the majority, if not the
entirety, of the [copyrighted works], but it has done so only to
the extent that governments have enacted such portions of the
[copyrighted works] into law. UpCodes’ copying is limited to
what is contained in the enacted laws themselves and as such,
it is tethered to its transformative purpose. On this basis, the
Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of fair use.”).

iv. The effect of the use on the potential
market for or value of the work

The fourth factor is “the effect of the use upon the potential
market for or value of the copyrighted work,” 17 U.S.C.
§ 107(4), and it is considered the “most important element
of fair use.” Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d
588 (1985). This factor “requires courts to consider not only
the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions
of the alleged infringer, but also whether unrestricted and
widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant
would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential
market for the original.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590, 114
S.Ct. 1164 (cleaned up). However, the Supreme Court has
cautioned that the fourth factor “can prove more complex than
at first it may seem” because “a potential loss of revenue is not
the whole story.” Google LLC, 593 U.S. at 35, 141 S.Ct. 1183.
Rather, there are two important wrinkles to the fourth factor
analysis: the source of the loss and countervailing public
benefits of the copying.

First, courts must consider the “source” of the loss. /d. Not
all market effects are cognizable under the Copyright Act,
and courts must distinguish between cognizable and non-

cognizable effects.>” Id. To this end, the factor considers

whether enforcing a copyright will allow the copyright
holder to gain profits that would “interfere with, not further,


--- Page 12 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

American Society for Testing and Materials v. UpCodes, Inc., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

copyright's basic creativity objectives.” /d. at 39, 141 S.Ct.
1183.

*15 Second, courts must balance the actual and potential
monetary effects against “the public benefits the copying will
likely produce.” /d. at 35, 141 S.Ct. 1183. This part of the
fourth factor analysis is especially weighty in the context of
standards that have been incorporated by reference into law
because, as the D.C. Circuit recognized, there are “substantial
public benefits of free and easy access to the law.” ASTM, 82
F4th at 1271.

Applying these principles, the fourth factor does not weigh
clearly in favor of one side or the other. It is plain to
see how UpCodes’ use of ASTM's Copyrighted Standards
will affect the market for the standards. If the Copyrighted
Standards can be obtained for free from UpCodes, consumers
will be less incentivized to purchase the standards from
ASTM for a fee. After all, UpCodes specifically identifies
the Copyrighted Standards as ASTM standards and allows
its users to filter their searches on the UpCodes website
based on ASTM's authorship. See Defs.’ Mem. P. & A., ECF
No. 68, at 10. Therefore, “it is fair to say” that UpCodes’
copies are “an effective substitute” for the Copyrighted
Standards. /nternational Code Council, Inc. v. UpCodes, Inc.,
No. 17-6261, 2020 WL 2750636, at *28 (S.D.N.Y. May 27,
2020); see also Facility Guidelines Institute, Inc. v. UpCodes,
Inc., 677 F. Supp. 3d 955, 973 (E.D. Mo. 2023) (holding the
same).

However, there is reason to question whether enforcing
ASTM's copyright here would “interfere with, not further,
copyright's basic creativity objectives.” Google LLC, 593
U.S. at 39, 141 S.Ct. 1183. Copyright “should not grant
anyone more economic power than is necessary to achieve
the incentive to create,” id. at 21, 141 S.Ct. 1183 (quoting
Congress’ National Commission on New Technological Uses
of Copyrighted Works), and amicus curiae illustrate that
ASTM may have other incentives to continue developing
technical standards even if some of its standards lose their
copyright protection after being enacted into law. ASTM may
still be incentivized to create by its mission of promoting
product quality and public safety, its professional interest in
being recognized as a global leader in standard development,
and other monetary benefits that it may derive after its
standards are incorporated into law, like profits derived from
marketing its own compliance-focused training materials. See

WESTLAW

Amicus Br. Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. Supp. Defs.’
Opp'n Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 71-1, at 22-23.

Finally, the countervailing public benefits of UpCodes’
copying are substantial. As explained supra Section I.B.,
incorporation by reference creates serious notice and
accountability problems when the law is only accessible to
those who can afford to pay for it. Unlike in the federal
system, where federal law requires—at a minimum—that
referenced standards be made available for public inspection
at the Office of the Federal Register in Washington D.C.,
there is no requirement mandating the Copyrighted Standards
enacted by state and local jurisdictions be made publicly

available in any capacity. 50 And there is significant evidence
of the practical value of providing unfettered access to
technical standards that have been incorporated into law.
For example, journalists have explained that this access is
essential to inform their news coverage; union members
have explained that this access helps them advocate and
negotiate for safe working conditions; and the NAACP
has explained that this access helps citizens assert their
legal rights and advocate for legal reforms. See Amicus Br.
Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. Supp. Defs.’ Opp'n Mot.
Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 71-1, at 11-12.

*16 In sum, different elements of the fourth factor point in
different directions. On one hand, it seems fair to assume that
free online access to the Copyrighted Standards will lessen
customers’ incentive to purchase the standards from ASTM.
On the other hand, there is reason to believe that ASTM
will still be incentivized to create its standards, and there are
significant public benefits to allowing free online access to
technical standards that have been incorporated by reference
into law. Thus, the fourth factor “does not significantly tip the
balance one way or the other.” ASTM, 82 F.4th at 1272.

y. Conclusion

Having explored the fair use factors together and weighed
them “in light of the purposes of copyright,” Campbell, 510
U.S. at 578, 114S.Ct. 1164, I conclude that UpCodes’ copying
of ASTM's Copyrighted Standards is fair use. The first three
factors firmly support fair use. And the fourth factor does not
point clearly in one direction or the other. While I recognize
the potential harm caused to ASTM's markets by UpCodes’


--- Page 13 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

American Society for Testing and Materials v. UpCodes, Inc., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

copying, this fact “cannot outweigh the benefits and necessity
of enabling unfettered access to enacted laws.” /nternational
Code Council, Inc. v. UpCodes, Inc., No. 17-6261, 2020 WL
2750636, at *28 (S.D.N.Y. May 27, 2020). After all, copyright
law is not designed for the primary purpose of providing “a
special private benefit” to authors like ASTM. Sony Corp.
of America, 464 U.S. at 429, 104 S.Ct. 774. Private benefits
are only a “secondary consideration” to “the primary object”
of copyright law which lies instead “in the general benefits
derived by the public from the labors of authors.” United
States v. Paramount Pictures, 334 U.S. 131, 158, 68 S.Ct.
915, 92 L.Ed. 1260 (1948) (citation omitted). Here, the
public is best served by permitting the free dissemination of
technical standards that have been made into binding legal
requirements.

Multiple federal courts have analyzed whether the online
publication of technical standards that have been incorporated
by reference into law constitutes fair use, and all but one
have come to the same conclusion—finding a likelihood
of success on the merits of the defense of fair use, or

ultimately, fair use as a matter of law.*! Of course, this
trend does not resolve whether UpCodes’ publication of the
ten Copyrighted Standards constitutes fair use here. As the
Supreme Court has made clear, the fair use analysis “is not
to be simplified with bright-line rules,” and instead “calls for
case-by-case analysis.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577, 114 S.Ct.
1164. Nonetheless, these precedents offer helpful guidance
and affirm my conclusion that UpCodes’ copying is fair use.

ASTM
incorporation-by-reference of privately authored standards
are distinguishable because—unlike the standards at issue
in other cases—the Copyrighted Standards are indirectly
incorporated through “third-party references.” However, in
its briefs and in oral argument, ASTM failed to make a

contends that other cases involving the

persuasive argument for why indirect incorporation mandates

a different outcome from direct incorporation. 52 After
reviewing the specific method of incorporation at issue—
which identically incorporates by reference all ten of the
Copyrighted Standards—there is no justification for ASTM's
argument that the outcome here should be different.

*17 As explained supra Sections LC. and I.D., jurisdictions
like Philadelphia give effect to ASTM's Copyrighted
Standards

through two layers of incorporation. The

WESTLAW

Philadelphia Building Code adopted the International
Building Code (“IBC”), incorporating the IBC “as if fully set

forth” in the Philadelphia Building Code itself. >> And the
IBC incorporated the Copyrighted Standards, explaining that
the standards are considered, “in essence, part of’ the IBC

itself. °4

Although the text of the Copyrighted Standards is
not reprinted in the text of the law, the incorporating language
makes clear that Philadelphia effectively incorporates the
Copyrighted Standards into its Building Code. And the
fact that the incorporation of the Copyrighted Standards
occurs indirectly does not change its legal effect. What
matters is that “the consequence of the incorporation by
reference is virtually indistinguishable from a situation in
which the standard had been expressly copied into law” by
the jurisdiction. ASTM vy. Public. Resource.Org, Inc., 82 F.4th

1262, 1268 (D.C. Cir. 2023).

Here, the legal consequence of Philadelphia's indirect
incorporation is virtually indistinguishable from a situation in
which the Copyrighted Standards had been expressly copied
into law. The consequence of violating a requirement of
the Philadelphia Building Code is a three hundred dollar

fine. >> An Philadelphia states that all “codes and standards
referenced” in the Philadelphia Building Code “shall be
considered part of the requirements” of the Building Code.
Phila. Code ch. 4-200 § A-102.3 (available at Ex. 3, ECF
No. 66-4, at 3). Accordingly, if someone constructs a building
in Philadelphia and violates the requirements set out in the
Copyrighted Standards, that person may be subject to a

three hundred dollar fine. The consequence of the indirect
incorporation-by-reference is no different from a situation
in which the Copyrighted Standards had been reprinted in
the text of the law—either way, a person who violates the
Copyrighted Standard is subject to punishment. Thus, cases
analyzing directly incorporated standards remain germane to
this analysis.

In conclusion, UpCodes’ copying satisfies the affirmative
defense of fair use. Therefore, ASTM's copyright claims are
unlikely to succeed on the merits.

B. Trademark Claims
ASTM also alleges that UpCodes infringed on ASTM's
federally registered trademarks in violation of federal and
state laws governing trademark infringement (Counts IV and


--- Page 14 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

American Society for Testing and Materials v. UpCodes, Inc., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

VI); state laws governing trademark dilution (Count VII);
and federal and common law governing unfair competition

(Counts V). In response, UpCodes asserts the affirmative
defense of nominative fair use. For the reasons set forth below,
UpCodes’ references to ASTM's mark constitute nominative
fair use and ASTM's trademark claims therefore fail.

“The same standards apply to federal trademark infringement,
federal unfair competition, and Pennsylvania common law
unfair competition claims.” Maduka v. Tropical Naturals,

Ltd., 409 F. Supp. 3d 337, 354-55 (E.D. Pa. 2019). 37 To
succeed on any of its claims, ASTM “must
that (1) it has a valid and legally protectable mark; (2) it
owns the mark; and (3) the defendant's use of the mark to
identify goods or services causes a likelihood of confusion.”

lemonstrate

A & H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237
F.3d 198, 210 (3d Cir. 2000). The first two requirements—
validity and legal protectability—are established when a mark
is federally registered and has become incontestable. See
Fisons Horticulture, Inc. v. Vigoro Industries, Inc., 30 F.3d

466, 472 (3d Cir. 1994).>* It is undisputed that ASTM owns
the incontestable, federally registered ASTM Mark (Reg. No.
2,679,320), see Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 37, thus
ASTM satisfies these two requirements.

*18 The validity of ASTM's claims hinges on the third
requirement—likelihood of confusion—and the affirmative
defense of nominative fair use. The parties disagree on the
appropriate legal framework governing these issues, and,
specifically, how the likelihood of confusion requirement
fits into the Third Circuit's approach to nominative fair use.
See Tr. Oral Arg., ECF No. 96, at 64-66, 76-77, 81-84
(disagreeing on the proper approach). ASTM contends that,
because UpCodes cannot establish nominative fair use, the
court should analyze likelihood of confusion under the
traditional standard. UpCodes disagrees, contending that,
where nominative fair use is at issue, the court should apply
a modified likelihood of confusion standard that is tailored
to the nominative use context. UpCodes is correct, and the
modified standard applies.

1. UpCodes’ Nominative Use

“A likelihood of confusion exists when ‘consumers viewing
the mark would probably assume that the product or service it

WESTLAW

represents is associated with the source of a different product
or service identified by a similar mark.’ ” 4 & H Sportswear,
Inc., 237 F.3d at 211 (quoting Dranoff-Perlstein Assocs. v.
Sklar, 967 F.2d 852, 862 (3d Cir. 1992)). The Third Circuit
has developed a non-exhaustive list of ten factors (the “Lapp
factors”) for courts to consider in determining whether there
is a likelihood of confusion between marks:

(1) the degree of similarity between
the owner's mark and the alleged
infringing mark; (2) the strength of
the owner's mark; (3) the price of
the goods and other factors indicative
of the care and attention expected of
consumers when making a purchase;
(4) the length of time the defendant
has used the mark without evidence
of actual confusion arising; (5) the
intent of the defendant in adopting
the mark; (6) the evidence of actual
confusion; (7) whether the goods,
though not competing, are marketed
through the same channels of trade and
advertised through the same media;
(8) the extent to which the targets
of the parties’ sales efforts are the
same; (9) the relationship of the
goods in the minds of consumers
because of the similarity of function;
(10) other facts suggesting that the
consuming public might expect the
prior owner to manufacture a product
in the defendant's market, or that he is
likely to expand into that market.

Jd. District courts are not obligated to use the Lapp factors,
and not all factors will be relevant or equally weighted in all
cases. /d. at 214-15. Thus, district courts “should utilize the
factors that seem appropriate to a given situation.” /d. at 215.

“Fair use” is a defense to trademark infringement that
“presents a fact pattern different from that of a normal
infringement suit.” Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v.
Lendingtree, Inc., 425 F.3d 211, 217 (3d Cir. 2005). A typical

trademark infringement case “involves the defendant's having
passed off another's mark as its own or having used a similar
name, confusing the public as to precisely whose goods are
being sold.” /d. In these cases, “[l]ikelihood of confusion is
the sole issue.” /d. By contrast, in fair use cases, the defendant
“is not purporting to be selling goods or services that the
plaintiff has trademarked ....” /d. Instead, the defendant “is
using plaintiffs mark in order to refer to defendant's own
goods or to the goods of the trademark owner in a way that
might confuse the public as to the relationship between the
two.” /d. (emphasis added). The legal framework in fair use
cases “still involves a showing that [defendant's] reference
to [plaintiff's] mark will likely confuse the public, but the
analysis does not end there [because] the use may nonetheless
be permissible if it is ‘fair.’ ” /d.

Nominative fair use is a separate defense that arises when
“the only practical way to refer to something is to use the
trademarked term.” /d. at 214 (quoting KP Permanent Make-
Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc., 328 F.3d 1061, 1972
(9th Cir. 2003)). In nominative fair use cases, “the alleged
infringer uses the trademark holder's mark to describe the
trademark holder's product, even if the alleged infringer's
ultimate goal is to describe his own product.” KP Permanent
Make-Up, Inc., 328 F.3d at 1071-72 (cleaned up) (emphasis
added). For example, “[t]he use of the term ‘Volkswagen’ by

a car mechanic in an [advertisement] describing the types of
cars he repairs” is nominative fair use. Lendingtree, Inc., 425
F.3d at 214. The mechanic is clearly referring to another's
product, but he does so “in order to describe what he does.” /d.

*19 Like the car mechanic, UpCodes uses ASTM's mark in
a nominative manner. UpCodes “uses the trademark holder's
mark” (i.e., the term “ASTM”’) “to describe the trademark
holder's product” (i.e., the Copyrighted Standards), even
though UpCodes is describing something on its own website.
KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc., 328 F.3d at 1071-72 (cleaned
up). And “the only practical way” for UpCodes to refer to
the Copyrighted Standards “is to use the trademarked term,”
Lendingtree, Inc., 425 F.3d at 214, because the entities that
incorporate the Copyrighted Standards into law also use the
trademarked term. See 2018 Int'l Bldg. Code, ch 35 (available
at Ex. 2, ECF No. 66-3) (using “ASTM” to describe the
Copyrighted Standards); cf’ ASTM y. Public.Resource.Org,
Inc., 597 F. Supp. 3d 213, 243 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (“[H]t is hard
to see how the defendant could fulfill its goal of informing
the public about the law without identifying the standard by

WESTLAW

its name—the very name also used in the incorporating law.”’)
(cleaned up). Thus, UpCodes’ use is nominative.

2. Third Circuit's Approach to Nominative Fair Use

To determine whether a defendant's nominative use is fair—
and thus satisfies the affirmative defense of nominative fair
use—the Third Circuit employs a two-step framework. See
Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Lendingtree, Inc., 425
F.3d 211, 222-227 (3d Cir. 2005) (setting out the modified
framework).

At the first step, courts consider whether the plaintiff has
proven that “confusion is likely due to the defendant's use of
plaintiff's mark.” /d. at 222. To do so, courts use a modified
likelihood of confusion test because certain Lapp factors
would improperly “indicate a likelihood of confusion ...
simply because the mark is being employed in a nominative
manner.” /d. at 224 (emphasis in original). Under the modified
test, the first two Lapp factors—(1) degree of similarity
between the owner's mark and the alleged infringing mark,
and (2) strength of the owner's mark—are ignored. /d. at
224-25.

The determination of which remaining Lapp factors are
relevant and probative “should be made in the first instance
by the District Court,” but the Third Circuit has recognized
that four factors “appear most relevant in assessing likely
confusion” in nominative use cases: (1) the price of the goods
and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected
of consumers when making a purchase; (2) the length of
time the defendant has used the mark without evidence of
actual confusion; (3) the intent of the defendant in adopting
the mark; and (4) the evidence of actual confusion. /d. at
225-26. “[T]hese four factors are the essence of the inquiry,”
but “others may prove useful in certain contexts.” /d. at 226.

It is only after the plaintiff has met its burden of “proving
that confusion is likely,” that “the burden then shifts to
defendant to show that its nominative use of plaintiff's mark
is nonetheless fair.” /d. at 222.

3. Modified Likelihood-of-Confusion Analysis


--- Page 16 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025

American Society for Testing and Materials v. UpCodes, Inc., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2024)

UpCodes employs ASTM's mark “in a nominative manner,”
so the Third Circuit's two-step nominative fair use framework
applies. /d. at 224. Because ASTM does not meet its burden
of showing a likelihood of confusion under the modified test,
ASTM's trademark claims fail.

At step one of the analysis, ASTM must prove that confusion
is likely due to UpCodes’ use of ASTM's mark, and—because
this is a nominative use case—“we must tailor the [likelihood
of confusion] test and measure only those factors that are
meaningful and probative in the context of nominative fair
use.” /d. The first two Lapp factors are ignored, and the focus
is instead on the four factors that the Third Circuit considers
“most relevant in assessing likely confusion” in nominative
use cases. /d. at 225. Because UpCodes has only published the

Copyrighted Standards for a relatively short period of time, 39

the factor concerning the length of time that UpCodes has
used the mark without evidence of actual confusion is, of
course, not very probative. Thus, the most relevant factors
are: (1) the price of the goods and other factors indicative of
the care and attention expected of consumers when making a
purchase; (2) the intent of UpCodes in adopting the mark; and

(3) the evidence of actual confusion. See Lendingtree, Inc.,
425 F.3d at 238-39.

*20 Applying these factors, ASTM is unable to meet its
burden of showing likely confusion.

First, consumers of the Copyrighted Standards are likely to
use significant care and attention when making a purchase.
Generally, “[t]he cheaper the goods or the less sophisticated
the consumers, the more likely that a use may confuse.” /d. at
248 (Fisher, J, concurring). Here, the relevant consumers are
sophisticated. ASTM's copyrighted standards are “targeted at
technical people” including “engineers, architects, builders,
and suppliers and manufacturers of construction materials.”
Defs.’ Mem. P. & A., ECF No. 68, at 36 (cleaned up). These
are “sophisticated actors who are looking to follow fairly
specific laws” and who are likely to “use care in selecting

the source of their laws” when the safety of a building is in
question. Tr. Oral Arg., ECF No. 96, at 66:10-19. Thus, this
factor does not suggest a likelihood of confusion.

Second, UpCodes’ intent in using the term “ASTM” is not to
“confuse or deceive consumers as to the product's source ....”
Versa Products Co., Inc. v. Bifold Co. (Mfg.) Ltd., 50 F.3d 189,
205 (3d Cir. 1995). As explained above, “the only practical
way” for UpCodes to refer to the Copyrighted Standards
“is to use the trademarked term.” Lendingtree, Inc., 425
F.3d at 214. UpCodes’ intent in using the ASTM mark is
to accurately identify which privately authored standard has
been incorporated into law. UpCodes uses the mark to clarify,
not to confuse. Thus, UpCodes’ intent does not suggest a
likelihood of confusion.

Finally, ASTM concedes that it can show no evidence of
actual consumer confusion. See Defs.” Mem. P. & A., ECF
No. 68, at 36 (citing deposition available at ECF No. 68-2).

Together, the relevant Lapp factors reflect that ASTM has not
met its burden of showing a likelihood of confusion. Thus,
my analysis ends here. I conclude that ASTM is unlikely to
succeed on the merits of its trademark claims.

V. CONCLUSION

For the reasons discussed, ASTM cannot show a likelihood
of success on the merits of its copyright and trademark
claims. Because this “gateway” preliminary injunction factor
is not met, the remaining preliminary injunction factors are
irrelevant. See Reilly v. City of Harrisburg, 858 F.3d 173,
179 (3d Cir. 2017). ASTM has failed to show a likelihood
of success on the merits. I will deny ASTM's motion for a
preliminary injunction.

Act “for the regulation of construction through the technical codes.” Phila. Code ch. 4-200 § A-101.3

of Philadelphia adopted the 2018 International Building Code as the Philadelphia Building Code, subject to
local amendments. Id. § B-1.1 (available at ECF No. 66-4, at 18). As explained below, the 2018 International

The physical and online availability of referenced standards may differ depending on the kind of government
entity that incorporates by reference the standard. When federal agencies incorporate by reference privately
authored materials, federal law requires copies of incorporated standards to be, at a minimum, available
for public inspection at the Office of the Federal Register's reading room in Washington D.C., and in the
promulgating agency's public library. See id. at 317. ASTM also operates an online read-only reading room
(with no print or download options) for ASTM standards that have been incorporated into federal law.
See Reading Room, ASTM Int'l, https://www.astm.org/products-services/reading-room.html (last accessed
Sept. 4, 2024). However, there does not appear to be any corresponding law requiring that state and local
governments make copies of incorporated standards available for review, and ASTM's counsel clarified during
oral argument that the Copyrighted Standards at issue in this case were not available online for free before

Because the ICC only references the Copyrighted Standards by name and does not reproduce the language
of the standards in its publication, the ICC does not pay any licensing fees to ASTM for referencing the
standards. See Tr. Oral Arg., ECF No. 96, at 11:2-5.

Phila. Code ch. 4-200 § B-1.2 (available at Ex. 3, ECF No. 66-4, at 18).

In its Complaint, ASTM also alleges that UpCodes altered or removed copyright management information in
violation of 17 U.S.C. § 1202. See Compl., ECF No. 1 {fj 88-93 (describing Count III). However, in ASTM's
briefs and oral argument in support of its motion for preliminary injunction, ASTM does not argue why it is
likely to succeed on the merits of this claim. See ECF Nos. 62, 76, 96.

UpCodes asserts two additional rationales for why ASTM's copyright claims must fail—(i) the principle that
“no one can own the law,” and (ii) the merger doctrine—but these arguments are not dispositive. Because
ASTM's copyright claims are wholly defeated by UpCodes’ fair use defense, | limit my ruling to that analysis
and decline to rule on the merits of UpCodes’ supplemental arguments.

Under the Copyright Act, copyright owners hold the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the
following: “(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; (2) to prepare derivative works
based upon the copyrighted work; (3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending; (4) in the case of literary,
musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works,
to perform the copyrighted work publicly; (5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic
works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion
picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and (6) in the case of sound
recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.” 17 U.S.C.
§ 106.

the public.” Harper & Row Publishers, Inc., 471 U.S. at 546, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (citation omitted). As explained

Each of the ten Copyrighted Standards is listed by name in the “Referenced Standards” chapter of the
IBC, which states that “[t]hese standards, in essence, are part of this code ....” 2018 Int'l Bldg. Code, ch 35

Standards that are binding. It simply adopts each Copyrighted Standard wholesale. See id.

ASTM argues that “UpCodes’ subjective intent is of no moment” because the Supreme Court's holding in
Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508, 143 S.Ct. 1258, 215 L.Ed.2d 473
(2023) confirmed that fair use is an objective inquiry. Pl.’s Reply, ECF No. 76, at 27. However, this evidence
constitutes “objective indicia of the use's purpose and character, including ... the reasons for copying.”

See the D.C. District Court's opinion, ASTM v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 597 F. Supp. 3d 213, 233 (D.D.C.
2022), dividing the 217 standards at issue into groups based on their various kinds of incorporation and their
different legal consequences.

For example, a “lethal parody, like a scathing theatre review, may kill demand for the original,” but “this kind of
harm, even if directly translated into foregone dollars, is not cognizable under the Copyright Act.” Id. (internal

use defense); National Fire Protection Association, Inc. v. UpCodes, Inc., No. 21-5262, 2021 WL 4913276
(C.D. Cal. 2021) (same) (but note the district court subsequently changed course and found a genuine dispute
of material fact as to fair use in National Fire Protection Association, Inc. v. UpCodes, Inc., No. 21-5262 (Aug.

of fair use for the copying of ASTM standards that were incorporated by reference into law).

In its briefs, ASTM repeatedly contends that direct incorporation by reference and indirect incorporation by
reference (via a “third-party reference”) are distinct and thus cases involving direct incorporation by reference
are inapposite. See, e.g., Pl.’s Revised Mem., ECF No. 62, at 21, 29, 31; Pl.’s Reply, ECF No. 76, at 24, 28, 29,
41. But these claims are conclusory, and ASTM fails to provide an explanation for why indirect incorporation
should be treated differently. During oral argument, | reminded ASTM's counsel that they must explain the
reasons behind their contention that the outcome should be different for standards that have been indirectly
incorporated and standards that have been directly incorporated. The exchange is excerpted below:

THE COURT: “In other words, there's a middle person [involved in the incorporation of ASTM's Copyrighted
Standards] .... [A]s far as | could find, this is the only case that involves a middle person. Is that correct?”

ORDER
Graham C. Mullen, United States District Judge

THIS MATTER comes before the Court upon Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF Doc. 13], which was filed on
March 23, 2020. Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF Doc. 16] was
filed on May 6, 2020 and Plaintiff filed a Reply on May 13, 2020. This Motion, now being fully briefed, is ripe for
consideration and the Court finds the following.

|. BACKGROUND

This copyright infringement case was brought by Plaintiff David Oppenheimer on January 17, 2019 against Defendants
William Stacey Moore and the ACL LLC (""ACL""). ECF Doc. 1. The Copyrighted Work is a photograph framing the event
center lobby of Harrah's Cherokee Casino Resort (""Harrah's""). ECF Doc. 1-1. Defendant ACL operates the website
""iplaycornhole.com"" and advertised an event to be held at Harrah's, the ""2016 Championship of Bags,"" on
iplaycornhole.com. ECF Doc. 14-2 at 12. Without having licensed to use, obtained authorization, or in any way compensated
Plaintiff for its use of the Copyrighted Work, Defendant ACL used the Copyrighted Work on its website to promote the 2016
Championship of Bags. ECF Doc. 14-2 at 2, 12; ECF Doc. 1-3. Plaintiff attests that his copyrighted photographs display his
copyright management information (""CMI"") when first published, and the Copyrighted Work displayed his CMI when first
published. ECF Doc. 1, § 10; ECF Doc. 14-2 at 2. Because Defendants were on notice or should have been on notice for
copyrights, Plaintiff sued Defendants for violating federal copyright law. ECF Doc. 1, ¥§ 1, 10. Any other relevant facts are
set forth in the discussion section below.

Il. STANDARD OF REVIEW

Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, ""[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no
genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
Material facts are those ""that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,"" and ""the materiality
determination rests on the substantive law.""

genuine ""if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party."" /d. ""[T]he mere
existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for
summary judgment."" /d. at 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (alteration in original).

The ""party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its
motion, and identifying those portions of ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,
together with the affidavits, if any,’ which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.""_Celotex
Corp. v. Catrett 477 U.S. 317 , 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) . Once the movant has met the initial burden,
the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to identify specific facts showing there is a genuine issue of material fact. See
Anderson. 477 U.S. at 256 , 106 S.Ct. 2505 . In considering a motion for summary judgment, a Court views all evidence in
the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. /d. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505 .

Where a nonmoving party ""shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to
justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or
declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d)(1)—(3). Additionally, where
""a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required
by Rule 56(c), the court may ... consider the fact undisputed."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2). It is with these standards in mind that
the Court considers the present matter.

Ill. DISCUSSION

Plaintiff seeks only partial summary judgment, moving for summary judgment as to: (1) Defendants’ liability for direct
copyright infringement and (2) five of Defendants’ affirmative defenses, including fair use, unclean hands, de minimis use,
implied license, and failure to mitigate damages. The Court addresses each argument in turn below.

a. Defendants’ Liability for Direct Copyright Infringement

Plaintiff maintains there is no dispute of material fact and Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to Plaintiff's
claim for direct copyright infringement. A copyright holder is granted "" ‘exclusive rights’ to use and to authorize the use of his
work in five qualified ways, including reproduction of the copyrighted work in copies."" Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City
Studios, Inc. 464 U.S. 417 , 433, 104 S.Ct. 774 , 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) ; 17 U.S.C. § 106 (2018). Whoever violates an
exclusive right of the copyright holder infringes upon the copyright. 17 U.S.C. § 501(a) ; Sony Corp. of Am, 464 U.S. at 433
, 104 S.Ct. 774 . To allege copyright infringement, a plaintiff must prove: (1) valid copyright ownership and (2) copying of the
original elements of the copyright. CoStar Grp.. Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc. , 373 F.3d 544 , 549 (4th Cir. 2004).

Plaintiff sets forth that he holds a certificate of copyright registration for the Copyrighted Work issued by the United States
Copyright Office. ECF Doc. 1-2. A certificate of registration ""shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the
copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate."" 17 U.S.C. § 410(c). Thus, Defendants have the burden to overcome the
presumption that the copyrights are valid. See Universal Furniture Int'l. Inc. v. Collezione Europa USA, Inc. 618 F.3d 417,
429 (4th Cir. 2010). Defendants make no

[504 F.Supp.3d 508]

attempt to dispute the validity of the copyrights for the Copyrighted Work. Therefore, Plaintiff has succeeded in establishing
valid copyright ownership exists.

Next, Plaintiff argues there is no contrary evidence to that establishing Defendants directly copied the Copyrighted Work and
published it on the internet without license or authorization. ECF Doc. 1-3 (showing the website post where the Copyrighted
Work was copied); ECF Doc. 14-2 at 9, 12 (documenting that Defendant Moore admitted the Copyrighted Work was
displayed on iplaycornhole.com); ECF Doc. 14-2 at 11 (explaining that Defendant Moore was responsible for managing
iplaycornhole.com and showing that Defendant Moore admitted Defendant ACL ran the website where Plaintiff's photograph
was used); ECF Doc. 14-2 at 15, 18 (explaining in Defendants’ Response to Plaintiff's First Interrogatories that, although
Defendants do not recall whether the Copyrighted Work was acquired from Harrah's or a Google search, the Copyrighted
Work was posted on Defendant ACL's website on or around November 18, 2015 through December 2016). Again,
Defendants do not seek to dispute the validity of this evidence, and by failing to dispute these facts, they have admitted that
the Copyrighted Work was copied.

Nevertheless, Defendants argue there could be an issue of material fact as to whether the photograph was provided to
Defendants by an act of a sovereign state, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and its tribal entities (""the Tribe""), which
could bar Plaintiff's claims. The act of state doctrine is applicable where ""the relief sought or the defense interposed would
[require] a court in the United States to declare invalid the official act of a foreign sovereign performed within its own
territory."" W.S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Env't Tectonics Corp., Int'l, 493 U.S. 400 , 405,110 S.Ct. 701 , 107 L.Ed.2d 816 (1990) .
The issue only arises ""when a court must decide —that is, when the outcome of the case turns upon—the effect of official
action by a foreign sovereign. When that question is not in the case, neither is the act of state doctrine."" /d. at 406, 110 S.Ct.
701 (emphasis in original). The purpose behind the doctrine is that, were the United States to reexamine and possibly
condemn the acts of another sovereign state, it could ""imperil the amicable relations between governments and vex the
peace of nations."" Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino , 376 U.S. 398 , 417-18, 84 S.Ct. 923 , 11 L.Ed.2d 804 (1964)
(quoting_Oetjen v. Cent. Leather Co. , 246 U.S. 297 , 303-04, 38 S.Ct. 309 , 62 L.Ed. 726 (1918) ). In considering whether
the doctrine should be invoked, the policies underlying the act of state doctrine may be considered. W.S. Kirkpatrick & Co...
493 U.S. at 409 , 110 S.Ct. 701 .

Defendants urge the Court to conclude that because there may be an issue of fact as to whether the Tribe or its entities
acted officially by supplying Defendants with the photograph to be used in marketing the event at Harrah's, summary
judgment is improper. According to Defendants, if the Tribe provided the photo to Defendants, granting Plaintiff summary
judgment would be an indirect attack on the Tribe's sovereignty. The Court disagrees. To say that the act of state doctrine
applies is to argue that the outcome of this case turns on whether the Tribe validly gave the photo to Defendants in its official
capacity and, thereby, made it so that Defendants’ copying and posting of the Copyrighted Work was not infringement. This
theory is far too attenuated where Defendants, who are not alleged to be part of the Tribe, took the Copyrighted Work and
illegally copied it onto their website. Such a conclusion is especially true given that Defendants’ theory in no

[504 F.Supp.3d 509]

way serves to promote the rationale behind the act of state doctrine. There is no risk of imperiling amicable relationships
between the government and the Tribe. The Court finds that the act of state doctrine should not be invoked here, and
Defendants have offered no evidence to dispute the validity of the copyrights or to dispute their acts in copying the
Copyrighted Work. Therefore, there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to the direct copyright infringement that
occurred when Defendants copied and published the Copyrighted Work on their website. +


--- Page 3 ---
b. Defendant Moore's Liability

While Plaintiff has clearly established direct copyright infringement here on the part of Defendant ACL, it remains for the
Court to determine whether Defendant Moore is individually liable for the infringement. Defendants maintain that Defendant
Moore is not liable for direct copyright infringement because Plaintiff has not established facts or law piercing the corporate
veil and, under North Carolina law, a person is not liable for the obligations of an LLC solely by virtue ""of being an interest
owner, manager, or other company official."" N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57D-3-30 (2020). Yet, Congress has established that it is
illegal to reproduce a copyrighted work in copies or to distribute copies of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 106. ""Anyone
who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner ... is an infringer of the copyright."" /d. § 501(a). A direct
infringer is ""characterized as one who ‘trespasses into [the copyright owner's] exclusive domain’ established in § 106.""
CoStar Grp., Inc.__373 F.3d at 549 (quoting Sony, 464 U.S. at 433 , 104 S.Ct. 774 ). Thus, simply because a limited liability
company was found directly liable for copyright infringement does not prevent an individual who actually participated in the
copyright violation from being personally liable for direct copyright infringement. See Universal Furniture Int'l, Inc. v. Frankel
835 F. Supp. 2d 35 , 49 (M.D.N.C. 2011), affd , 538 F. App'x 267 (4th Cir. 2013).

Regardless of his role with Defendant ACL, Defendant Moore is personally liable for direct copyright infringement because
he violated Plaintiffs exclusive copyrights based on the undisputed facts set forth in Plaintiff's Motion. Defendant Moore
verified in deposition that he is ""the sole owner of the ACL, LLC, which operates iplaycornhole.com."" ECF Doc. 14-2 at 10.
He

[504 F.Supp.3d 510]

also admitted the Copyrighted Work was published on iplaycornhole.com and that he was the individual who managed the
website when it was published. /d. at 11. Defendants do not dispute these facts. Even if Defendant Moore was acting on
behalf of Defendant ACL when he copied and pasted the Copyrighted Work to Defendant ACL's website, he is liable for
direct copyright infringement because he personally infringed on Plaintiff's exclusive copyrights.

c. Defendants’ Fair Use and Unclean Hands Affirmative Defenses

Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on five of Defendants’ affirmative defenses, but the only affirmative defenses
Defendants argue in their Response are those of fair use and unclean hands, the latter of which is apparently argued under
the misuse of copyright doctrine. Defendants' predicate for these two defenses is that Plaintiff is an alleged copyright troll.
ECF Doc. 16 at 12-13. Defendants argue that Plaintiff has brought hundreds of infringement suits nationwide and brings
copyright infringement claims against defendants after paying for a monthly service that scours the web looking for infringing
uses of his copyrighted photos. /d. at 12. Apparently, the only supporting evidence Defendants have provided for this theory
includes a list of lawsuits Defendants believe were filed by Plaintiff and a list of copyrights Defendants believe the Plaintiff
has registered with the USPTO, both provided in response to Plaintiff's request for production of documents supporting
Defendants' affirmative defenses. ECF Doc. 14-2 at 29. Notably, Defendants claim additional evidence is yet to be
uncovered in discovery, but they believe it will prove that Plaintiff's income is derived from photography by way of litigation or
threats of litigation over copyright infringement. ECF Doc. 16 at 12-13. However, discovery has long-since closed and
Defendants have not filed a motion to compel discovery, supplemented their response to Plaintiff's request for production, or
supplemented their Response to this Motion. Yet, Plaintiff has not offered evidence of the profits he earns from his
copyrighted works either, beyond claiming that he is a professional photographer who makes a living from creating
photographs and licensing their use for fees. ECF Doc. 14-2 at 1. Under this backdrop, the Court will look to Defendants'
affirmative defenses for fair use and unclean hands.

1. Fair Use

Turning first to the fair use doctrine, Congress has placed certain limitations on the exclusive rights of copyright owners, one
of which is the fair use limitation. 17 U.S.C. § 107. To determine whether the use of a copyrighted work is ""fair,"" courts
consider the following factors:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

Id. For the first factor, a commercial purpose for the use of a copyrighted work will likely weigh against fair use, while a use
for criticism, comment, news reporting, et cetera may favor fair use, depending on whether the goal of the use was to add
something new to the work. A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye v. iParadigms, LLC.__562 F.3d 630 , 638 (4th Cir. 2009). As to the
second factor, a use is less likely considered fair when the nature of the work is a creative product, rather than a factual
work. /d. at 640. For the third factor, as the amount of

[504 F.Supp.3d 511]


--- Page 4 ---
the copyright work used increases, so decreases the likelihood of finding the use fair. /d. at 642. Lastly, the fourth factor is
considered the ""single most important element of fair use,"" and looks to ""whether the secondary use usurps the market of
the original work."" Id. at 643 (quoting NX/VM Corp. v. The Ross Inst. , 364 F.3d 471 , 482 (2d Cir. 2004) ) (emphasis in
original). Ultimately, the inquiry into whether a use is ""fair"" must be decided on the facts of each case. Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. . 471 U.S. 539 , 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) .

Applying these factors to the facts of this case, the purpose and character of Defendants’ use appear to be of a commercial
nature, where Defendants have not argued or presented evidence contrary to them having used the work to promote
awareness about their cornhole championship. ECF Doc. 1-3; ECF Doc. 14-2 at 12. Additionally, while the photograph in
question is simply one of the Harrah's lobby, it required some artistic element and creativity to decide the perspective to
take, the placement and orientation of the camera, the settings to use, and the timing of the photograph. See U.S. Copyright
Office, Circular 42: Copyright Registration of Photographs , https:/www.copyright.gov/circs/ (last visited Nov. 19, 2020)
(classifying photographs as ""visual art works"" and explaining why they are classified as such); ECF Doc. 14-2 at 2 (attesting
to the care taken when creating the Copyrighted Work). Further, Defendants proceeded to copy the entire work to the
website iplaycornhole.com. ECF Doc. 1-3. Nevertheless, when turning to the final factor, it seems that Plaintiff has failed to
establish sufficient undisputed facts to support the effect Defendants’ use had upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work. While Plaintiff argues he is a professional photographer and his income is derived from licensing his
works, Defendants argue his income is derived from copyright infringement cases. Without more facts, perhaps those
attesting to the value of the photograph, the expected profit from the photograph, or even the value or expected profits
derived from similar photographs, the Court cannot make a determination as to the fourth factor of the fair use doctrine.
Plaintiff has not established sufficient facts that the secondary use usurped the market for the original work. While the Court
acknowledges that these factors are to be examined as a whole and no single factor is determinative, the fourth factor is
undoubtedly the most important factor. A reasonable jury could find that Defendants' use of the work had minimal effect
upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work and this would be key to analysis of the substantive law.
Therefore, summary judgment is not appropriate for this affirmative defense.

2. Unclean Hands

Plaintiff argues he is entitled to summary judgment upon Defendants’ unclean hands affirmative defense as well, while
Defendants seemingly argue that the misuse of copyright doctrine applies to prevent summary judgment on this matter. The
Fourth Circuit has established that misuse of copyright is a valid affirmative defense where the use of a copyright is contrary
to the public policy upon which copyrights are granted._Lasercomb Am., Inc. v. Reynolds , 911 F.2d 970 , 977 (4th Cir. 1990).
Typically, the defense applies when seeking to avoid anti-competitive behavior, but it can also apply to other scenarios
where a copyright owner attempts to extend the copyrights beyond their intended reach. /d. ; see also Religious Tech. Ctr. v.
Lerma, No. 95-1107-A, 1996 WL 633131 (E.D. Va. Oct. 4, 1996) (listing examples such as attempting to restrain a
defendant from using material over which

[504 F.Supp.3d 512]

the plaintiff has no rights, distributing the copyright discriminatorily, and refusing to supply a list of copyrighted songs where
requested). The underlying policy principles behind copyrights extend from the United States Constitution, with the relevant
policy here being to promote the ""useful arts."" See Lasercomb__911 F.2d at 977 (quoting U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8). If
Plaintiff's purpose in copyrighting the Copyrighted Work was to license it for use when individuals or companies need a
photo of the Harrah's lobby, then Plaintiff is likely not misusing his copyrights. Yet, a reasonable jury could find Plaintiff is
using copyrights to derive an income from infringement suits and this issue is one of fact that the Court should not decide.
Surely there are only minimal facts alleged to support this theory but, given that the Court is to construe the facts in favor of
Defendants, the Court finds that summary judgment is not appropriate as to this affirmative defense.

d. Defendants’ De Minimis Use, Implied License, and Failure to Mitigate Affirmative Defenses

As to the other defenses upon which Plaintiff seeks summary judgment—de minimis use, implied license, and failure to
mitigate—Defendants have made no effort to dispute that Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment except for claiming they
are unable to respond due to incomplete discovery. While Defendants claim they intend to file motions to compel answers
and other discovery, they never did so and the close of discovery long ago passed. As noted previously, where a party fails
to properly support an assertion of fact, it may be considered undisputed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2). Defendants have raised
these affirmative defenses without providing any supporting facts and have failed to offer any theory whatsoever about why
the Court should not grant summary judgment upon these matters. The Court finds that, because Defendants failed to
provide evidence supporting these affirmative defenses, or even explain what evidence could support these affirmative
defenses, Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment as to these three affirmative defenses.

IV. ORDER

For the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment should be GRANTED IN
PART.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that:

1. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Defendant ACL's liability for direct copyright infringement is


--- Page 5 ---
GRANTED ;

2. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Defendant Moore's liability for direct copyright infringement is
GRANTED ;

3. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to the affirmative defenses of de minimis use, implied license, and
failure to mitigate is GRANTED ; and

4. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Defendants’ affirmative defenses of fair use and unclean hands
is DENIED.

SO ORDERED .

Notes:

1Perhaps of some note is why the Court even considered this defense in its analysis, given that Plaintiff argues Defendants waived the defense. Plaintiff
first maintains that Defendants waived a defense of sovereign immunity and cannot raise the defense now. See, e.g. , ECF Doc. 17 at 3 (referring to
Defendants’ act of state defense as ""Defendants' sovereign immunity defense""). ""The act of state doctrine, however, although it shares with the immunity
doctrine a respect for sovereign states, concerns the limits for determining the validity of an otherwise applicable rule of law."" Sabbatino_, 376 U.S. at 438
, 84 S.Ct. 923 . Thus, these two theories are distinct and should not be conflated. Plaintiff also argues that Defendants waived the act of state defense by
failing to properly move to amend their answer to include the affirmative defense. ECF Doc. 17 at 4. But a waiver ""should not be effective unless the
failure to plead resulted in unfair surprise or prejudice."" /n re FirstPay, Inc. , 391 F. App'x 259, 270 (4th Cir. 2010) (quoting S. Wallace Edwards & Sons,
Inc. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. , 353 F.3d 367 , 373 (4th Cir. 2003) ) (finding that an affirmative defense was not waived even when it was raised for the first
time during summary judgment proceedings). Plaintiff had seven days to file a reply to Defendants’ Response and could have sought additional time with
a motion showing good cause for an extension. That Plaintiff did not request additional time to reply or raise unfair surprise or prejudice in his Reply
indicates there is no reason to invoke a waiver of the affirmative defense here.

OPINION

RYMER, Circuit Judge:

Los Angeles News Service (LANS) shot the Reginald Denny beating from its helicopter. Its videotape was copyrighted
and licensed to the media. KCAL-TV used it, without a license. LANS sued for copyright infringement, but the district court
granted summary judgment in KCAL's favor, holding that its telecasts of LANS's videotape were exempted from liability
under the ""fair use"" doctrine. 17 U.S.C. § 107. We see the balance of fair use factors differently, and reverse.

Los Angeles News Service (LANS) is an independent news organization that provides news stories, photographs,
audiovisual works and other services to the news media. When rioting broke out in Los Angeles on April 29, 1992, in the
aftermath of the Rodney King verdict, LANS's helicopter hovered above the intersection of Florence and Normandie where
Reginald Denny was beaten. Markika Tur's camera captured the incident from overhead. It was broadcast ""live"" on KCOP, a
LANS licensee, and by tape later that evening. Other stations broadcast the Videotape as well, before it was broadcast by
KCAL. KCAL asked LANS for a license, which LANS refused, but KCAL obtained a copy of the tape from another station
and broadcast it a number of times on April 30 and thereafter on its commercially sponsored news programs.

The district court held that the doctrine of fair use exempts KCAL from liability based on undisputed facts that the
Denny Videotape is a unique and newsworthy videotape of significant public interest and concern; KCAL used portions of
the tape in its newscasts for purposes of news reporting; and LANS failed to identify any sale or license or potential sale or
license that it lost due to KCAL's conduct. Accordingly, it granted summary judgment in KCAL's favor. LANS moved for
reconsideration based on evidence that it had lost at least one sale as a result of KCAL's unlicensed use of the Denny tape
and that KCAL had other footage of the beating available to it. The district court denied the motion, and LANS timely
appealed. '

""'Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact.’ If there are no genuine issues of material fact, or if, even after resolving
all issues in favor of the opposing party, a reasonable trier of fact can reach only one conclusion, a court may conclude as a
matter of law whether the challenged use qualifies as a fair use of the copyrighted work."" Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Moral
Majority, Inc., 796 F.2d 1148 , 1150 (9th Cir.1986) (quoting Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S.
539 , 559, 105 S.Ct. 2218 2230, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) ; other citations omitted).

LANS argues that the district court inappropriately resolved the fair use factors because KCAL's use was
nontransformative, commercial, and improper; it interfered with LANS's ability to control the initial dissemination of the


--- Page 2 ---
Denny tape; the use was substantial even though KCAL broadcast only 30 seconds of the four minute, 40 second Videotape
because it was the heart of the work; and it had a serious effect on the potential market for LANS's copyrighted work
because KCAL's unauthorized commercial broadcasts competed directly with LANS's authorized licensees.

KCAL, on the other hand, focuses on the factual nature of the Videotape and its use for news reporting purposes. It
challenges LANS's view that its use was nontransformative, noting that both the Supreme Court and this circuit have
recognized that news reporting is a productive use. See Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 561, 105 S.Ct. at 2231 ; Los
Angeles News Service v. Tullo, 973 F.2d 791 , 797 (9th Cir.1992). KCAL also emphasizes that the Videotape had been
published before

Page 1121

KCAL ever used it. Further, it points out, only a small portion of the total amount of LANS's tape was used, and even then,
only enough for KCAL to carry out its news reporting function of reporting on the riots. Moreover, KCAL submits, its use of
the Videotape did not diminish the potential sale of the work or interfere with its marketability because LANS entered into
more than a dozen licenses for the Videotape after KCAL used it. Rather, its use for news reporting purposes enabled the
public to understand what the rioters did to Denny, and thus did not replace any demand for the original work. Finally, KCAL
maintains that the Videotape is unique because the Videotape itself is part of the news event. For this reason, First
Amendment considerations reinforce the conclusion that KCAL's use was fair.

As KCAL undeniably used LANS's copyrighted work without permission, we turn to whether its use was fair. This
requires us to balance the non-exclusive factors set out in 17 U.S.C. § 107. ? Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 549, 105
S.Ct. at 2224-25 .

A

Purpose and character of use. Even though the fact that KCAL was reporting news weighs heavily in its favor (§ 107
itself gives news reporting as an example), the fact that LANS and KCAL are both in the business of gathering and selling
news cuts the other way. LANS does work that its licensees choose not to do for themselves, for example, operating its own
helicopter with news crew aboard, and gets paid for licensing its coverage of news to the media. By the same token, KCAL
is a for-profit company that is engaged in a commercial enterprise that also gathers, and then (indirectly) ""sells"" news. It,
therefore, ""stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price."" Harper & Row,
471 U. S. Reports 562, 105 S.Ct. at 2231 . ""[NJjewscasts are commercially supported by advertisers, who pass the cost of
sponsorship on to those who purchase their products."" Note, Who Can Use Yesterday's News?: Video Monitoring and the
Fair Use Doctrine, 81 Geo.L.J. 2345, 2345 n. 2 (1993). Accord Roy Export Co. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 503
F.Supp. 1137 , 1144 (S.D.N.Y.1980), aff'd, 672 F.2d 1095 (2d Cir.1982) . Thus, KCAL competes with other stations for
advertising dollars, which are in turn dependent upon KCAL's viewership. The fact that KCAL used LANS's copyrighted
footage free of charge, rather than paying LANS or someone else for the footage, or investing in its own helicopter and crew
to obtain the footage itself, at least raises an inference that its articulated purpose of reporting the news was mixed with the
actual purpose of doing so by using the best version--whether or not it meant riding LANS's (or some other station's)
copyrighted coattails. While this did not serve to supplant the copyright holder's commercially valuable right of first
publication as The Nation did in Harper & Row by scooping the hardcover and Time abstracts of President Ford's memoirs,
we cannot say that KCAL's use of the Denny tape had neither the effect nor purpose of depriving LANS of its also valuable
right of licensing its original videotape which creatively captured the Denny beating in a way that no one else did. See, e.g.,
Tullo, 973 F.2d at 796 .

On the other hand, there is a forceful argument that the LANS tape of the Denny beating itself became a news item
shortly after it was published because its view was so extraordinary. To the extent that KCAL ran the tape as a news story,
this would weigh in its favor. However, this factor does

Page 1122

not weigh nearly so heavily as it might otherwise since there is no evidence that KCAL used the tape in this way. It did not
attribute the tape to LANS, and so far as the record discloses, aired it as if it were KCAL's own rather than, for example,
indicating that the best tape of the beating had been made by a LANS helicopter crew. Instead, the tape was simply used as
part of KCAL's coverage of the riots. Although KCAL apparently ran its own voice-over, it does not appear to have added
anything new or transformative to what made the LANS work valuable--a clear, visual recording of the beating itself.

While the fact that KCAL had requested a license but had been refused one is not dispositive, see Campbell v. Acuff-
Rose Music. Inc., 510 U.S. 569 , 585 n. 18,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 1174 n. 18,127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) , ""the propriety of the
defendant's conduct"" is relevant to the character of the use at least to the extent that it may knowingly have exploited a
purloined work for free that could have been obtained for a fee. Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 562, 105 S.Ct. at 2231 ;
accord Narell v. Freeman, 872 F.2d 907 , 914 (9th Cir.1989). Unlike the circumstances in Campbell, nothing in this record
suggests that KCAL requested a license ""in a good faith effort to avoid this litigation."" Campbell, 510 U. S. Reports 585n.
18, 114 S.Ct. 1174 n. 18. And unlike the use of the original in 2 Live Crew's parody of ""Oh, Pretty Woman,"" KCAL obtained a
copy of the tape from another station, directly copied the original, superimposed its logo on the LANS footage, and used it
for the same purpose for which it would have been used had it been paid for.

Nature of the copyrighted work. The Denny beating tape is informational and factual and news; each characteristic
strongly favors KCAL. Likewise the fact that the tape was published before its use by KCAL. Harper & Row, 471 U. S.
Reports 564 , 105 S.Ct. at 2232 . Although the Videotape is not without creative aspect in that it is the result of Tur's skills
with a camera, still this factor makes it a great deal easier to find fair use. Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios,
Inc., 464 U.S. 417 , 455 n. 40,104 S.Ct. 774 , 795 n. 40,78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (contrasting motion pictures with news
broadcasts). Therefore, this factor weighs substantially in KCAL's favor. Tullo, 973 F.2d at 798 .

Cc

Amount and substantiality of what was used. While a small amount of the entire Videotape was used, it was all that
mattered. As we said of the defendant Audio Video Reporting Services in Los Angeles News Service v. Tullo, which
provided a video ""news clipping"" service by monitoring television news programs, recording them on videotape and selling
copies to interested individuals and businesses, ""[a]lthough AVRS copied only a small part of the raw footage shot by LANS,
it was the most valuable part of that footage. In preparing a newscast, a television station selects the most effective and
illustrative shots from the raw footage available. Thus the news programs AVRS copied included what LANS's customers
thought was the best of the LANS footage--its 'heart.'"" Id. at 798. Here, as there, this factor weighs against KCAL, for ""the
fact that a substantial portion of the infringing work was copied verbatim is evidence of the qualitative value of the copied
material, both to the originator and to the plagiarist who seeks to profit from marketing someone else's copyrighted
expression."" Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 565, 105 S.Ct. at 2233 .

D

Effect on the market. This case doesn't fit neatly into a traditional niche, because ""news"" isn't normally thought of as
having a secondary market. "" 'Copying a news broadcast may have a stronger claim to fair use than copying a motion
picture’ because the potential market for copies of news broadcasts is not as great as that for copies of movies.” Tullo, 973
F.2d at 798 n. 6 (quoting Sony, 464 U. S. Reports 455n. 40, 104 S.Ct. at 795 n. 40). Also, LANS's tape had been licensed--
and published--before KCAL's use, and was licensed after its use. To that extent, this factor weighs in favor of KCAL. At the
same time, KCAL's stated purpose was to use the tape as ""news"" and it was a potential (and in the past was an actual)
licensee or consumer of LANS's product;

Page 1123

here is evidence that, given what LANS and KCAL do, KCAL's use of LANS's works for free, without a license, would
destroy LANS's original, and primary market. Indeed, Sony suggests that this kind of duplication for commercial use may
give rise to a presumption or inference of harm. Sony, 464 U. S. Reports 451, 104 S.Ct. at 793 . Just as we recognized in
Los Angeles News Service v. Tullo that customers might choose to buy raw footage from LANS if they couldn't buy it from
AVRS, Tullo, 973 F.2d at 799 , KCAL was ready to buy from LANS if it could, but went elsewhere when it couldn't. Were this
‘o happen more broadly, it no doubt would adversely affect LANS's creative incentives. See Campbell, 510 U. S. Reports
587 -89 , 114 S.Ct. 1176 (courts must consider "" 'whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the
defendant ... would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market' for the original"") (quoting Nimmer, §
13.05[A], p. 113-102.61); Harper & Row, 471 U. S. Reports 569, 105 S.Ct. at 2235 . All told, this weighs against a finding of
air use.

In sum, KCAL's use of LANS's copyrighted tape was arguably in the public interest because it was a percipient
recording of a newsworthy event. However, KCAL's use was commercial and came in the wake of LANS's refusal of a
license. Although KCAL explains that it used the tape because it recorded news of considerable significance from the best
perspective of any witness, there is no evidence that alternatives were not available (albeit from a less desirable vantage
point). Also, while the tape had been licensed and published before KCAL's use, it is not obvious that there was no impact
on the market for first publication rights as KCAL itself requested a license. There is no dispute that KCAL used the heart of
the tape. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that fair use is the only reasonable conclusion a trier of fact could reach
in this case. We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.

REVERSED AND REMANDED.

SUMMARY ORDER

Plaintiff-appellant Roy Den Hollander, an attorney
proceeding pro se, appeals the district court's judgment in
which it denied his motion for summary judgment and granted
summary judgment sua sponte in favor of defendant-appellee
Paul Steinberg. We assume the parties' familiarity with the
underlying facts, the procedural *45 history of the case, and
the issues on appeal.

This Court reviews orders granting summary judgment
de novo to determine whether the district court properly
concluded that no genuine issues of material fact remained
and that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter
of law. See Miller v. Wolpoff & Abramson, LLP, 321 F.3d
292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate
“[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational
trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.” Matsushita
Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587,
106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).

Generally, in considering whether to grant summary
judgment, the court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all
inferences in favor of the nonmovant; the inferences to be
drawn from the underlying facts revealed in materials such
as affidavits, exhibits, interrogatory answers, and depositions
must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving
party. See Nationwide Life Ins. Co. v. Bankers Leasing Ass'n,
182 F.3d 157, 160 (2d Cir.1999). However, “[i]n considering
whether to grant summary judgment against the moving party
sua sponte, the court is required to view the evidence in


--- Page 2 ---

Hollander v. Steinberg, 419 Fed.Appx. 44 (2011)

the moving party's favor.” NetJets Aviation, Inc. v. LHC
Commce'ns, LLC, 537 F.3d 168, 179 (2d Cir.2008) (emphasis
added).

This Court has explained: “While it is not necessarily
reversible error in our Circuit for a district court to grant
summary judgment against the moving party without notice
or opportunity to defend, ... we have firmly discouraged the
practice.... [G]rants of summary judgment without notice will
be tolerated only in the absence of some indication that the
moving party might otherwise bring forward evidence that
would affect the ... determination ... when the facts before
the district court were fully developed so that the moving
party suffered no procedural prejudice.” Bridgeway Corp. v.
Citibank, 201 F.3d 134, 139 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted; emphasis added).

As an initial matter, we note that Bridgeway's strict
requirements for granting summary judgment sua sponte
against a moving party who lacks “notice or opportunity to
defend” do not apply to this case. In November 2009, the
district court issued an order that notified Den Hollander and
the defendants that it intended to treat the defendants’ filings
as a motion for summary judgment, and the court specifically
directed the parties to submit “all pertinent materials, ...
including materials addressing whether the defendants' use
of [Den Hollander]'s works is protected under the fair
use doctrine.” Den Hollander therefore had notice and an
opportunity to defend against the grounds upon which the
district court ultimately granted summary judgment against
him and in favor of Steinberg.

Den Hollander first argues that the district court erred by
failing to address two earlier instances of alleged copyright
infringement by Steinberg. A court of appeals generally will
not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal. See
Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 120-21, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49
L.Ed.2d 826 (1976); Virgilio v. City of New York, 407 F.3d
105, 116 (2d Cir.2005). The rule is not an absolute bar to
raising new issues on appeal; the Court may, in its discretion,
disregard the general rule when necessary to remedy manifest
or obvious injustice. See Thomas E. Hoar, Inc. v. Sara
Lee Corp., 900 F.2d 522, 527 (2d Cir.1990). Although Den
Hollander now claims that Steinberg committed copyright
infringement by four distinct actions, Den Hollander framed
his claims throughout the district court proceedings *46 as
based upon only the latter two of those actions. Because he

WESTLAW

did not clearly present the two earlier instances to the district
court, we decline to address them and find no reason to depart
from the well-established rule that this Court will not consider
issues raised for the first time on appeal. See id.

Next, Den Hollander argues that the district court relied upon
inadmissible evidence, specifically, Steinberg's statements
in a November 2008 letter-motion and at oral argument.
However, the district court's reliance upon the November
2008 letter-motion was minimal, and, in any event, Den
Hollander himself submitted a copy of the letter-motion as
part of his exhibits in support of his motion for summary
judgment; the court did not err by relying on that document.
Furthermore, a review of the oral argument transcript reveals
that the district court primarily used the proceedings as
an opportunity to confirm the procedural posture in which
Steinberg had submitted Den Hollander's essays to the state
court—information that was not immediately obvious from
the parties' papers.

In addition, the district court's findings about Steinberg's
purpose for submitting the essays were based primarily
upon Steinberg's state court filings—documents that Den
Hollander had attached to his declaration in support of
his own motion for summary judgment. And although
Den Hollander now claims that Steinberg made conflicting
statements at oral argument, the transcript reveals that, when
Steinberg finally gave answers that were consistent with
the procedural postures Den Hollander described in his
declaration, Den Hollander confirmed that those descriptions
were accurate. Thus, it is clear from the record that the district
court's decision to grant summary judgment sua sponte in
favor of Steinberg was based on sufficient and competent
evidence, about which there was no genuine dispute.

Finally, we agree with the district court that summary
judgment in favor of Steinberg was appropriate because
his use of the essays constituted fair use. See Hollander
v. Swindells—Donovan, No. 08—cv-4045, 2010 WL 844588
(E.D.N.Y. Mar.11, 2010). “[T]he determination of fair use
is an open-ended and context-sensitive inquiry.” Blanch v.
Koons, 467 F.3d 244, 251 (2d Cir.2006). An independent
review of the record in the present case makes clear that the
district court properly applied the statutory factors for fair use,
and that no rational trier of fact could have found for Den
Hollander.

Hollander v. Steinberg, 419 Fed.Appx. 44 (2011)

The Copyright Act provides, in pertinent part:

In determining whether the use made of a work in any
particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall
include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether
such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. § 107. This is not an exhaustive list of factors
a court may consider in determining whether a particular
use was a fair use. Campbell v. Acuff—Rose Music, Inc., 510
U.S. 569, 577, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994).
Also, the four factors should not “be treated in isolation, one
from another. All are to be explored, and the results weighed
together, in light of the purposes of copyright.” *47 Jd. at
578, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Taken together, the factors vitiate Den
Hollander's claim.

As to the first statutory factor, Steinberg used Den Hollander's
essays in the course of two judicial proceedings. The “purpose
and character” of that use was not commercial, but rather part
of a litigation strategy. See 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). In the Note
accompanying § 107, Congress listed numerous examples
of “the sort of activities the courts might regard as fair
use under the circumstances,” including “reproduction of a
work in legislative or judicial proceedings or reports.” House
Committee on the Judiciary, H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476 (1976).

Here, Steinberg reproduced Den Hollander's essays “in ...
judicial proceedings.” Jd.

As to the second statutory factor, “the nature of the
copyrighted work,” 17 U.S.C. § 107(2), Den Hollander claims
that the district court should not have characterized his essays
as “published” simply because he posted them temporarily
on his website. It is true that “the scope of fair use is
narrower with respect to unpublished works.” Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 564, 105
S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). However, “[t]he fact that

WESTLAW

a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use
if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above
factors.” 17 U.S.C. § 107. The district court considered all
four of the statutory factors, which taken together compel a
finding of fair use; thus, we need not decide whether Den
Hollander “published” his essays when he temporarily posted
them on his website.

The third statutory factor, “the amount and substantiality
of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work
as a whole,” 17 U.S.C. § 107(3), would appear to weigh
in Den Hollander's favor, as Steinberg reproduced the
essays in full. However, in applying this factor, we also
consider “whether the quantity of the material used was
reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.” Am.
Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913, 926 (2d
Cir.1994) (internal quotations omitted; emphasis added).
Here, Steinberg's purpose was to prevail in litigation; in
judicial proceedings, litigants regularly reproduce documents
in full. Steinberg's reproduction of Den Hollander's essays
would therefore appear to be reasonable. But even assuming
that it was unreasonable, this single factor would not outweigh
the other statutory factors.

Finally, the fourth factor, “the effect of the use upon the
potential market for or value of the copyrighted work,” 17
U.S.C. § 107(4), clearly favors Steinberg. With this factor,
“Tt]he focus ... is on whether defendants are offering a market
substitute for the original.” NX7VM Corp. v. Ross Inst., 364
F.3d 471, 481 (2d Cir.2004). “[OJur concern is not whether
the secondary use suppresses or even destroys the market for
the original work or its potential derivatives, but whether the

secondary use usurps the market of the original work.” Jd.
Should Den Hollander offer his essays for sale, it is highly
unlikely that potentially interested readers would even be
aware of the essays' presence in a court file, let alone choose
to acquire copies by the cumbersome methods of visiting
a courthouse to make copies or using PACER. And in any
event, Den Hollander has offered no evidence that Steinberg
“usurped the market” for the essays by submitting them as
exhibits in judicial proceedings.

We conclude that the district court applied the statutory
factors set out in 17 U.S.C. § 107 and correctly determined
that Steinberg's use of Den Hollander's essays was a fair
use. Summary judgment was appropriate because “the record
taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of *48 fact

106 S.Ct. 1348. All Citations

We have considered Den Hollander's remaining arguments 419 Fed.Appx. 44

and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM
the judgment of the district court.

OPINION AND ORDER
KATHERINE POLK FAILLA, District Judge:

Plaintiff Elliot McGucken is a photographer who focuses on landscapes and seascapes. On March 13, 2019, Plaintiff posted
on his Instagram account a photograph of an ephemeral lake (the ""Photograph"") that had appeared in Death Valley,
California. The following day, Defendant Newsweek published an article about the ephemeral lake (the ""Article""), embedding
Plaintiff's Instagram post of the lake as part of the Article. Plaintiff brought this action for copyright infringement, alleging that
Defendant reproduced and displayed the Photograph on its website without his consent. Defendant moves to dismiss the
action for failure to state a claim, arguing, inter alia , that it either had a valid sublicense to use the Photograph as a result of
Plaintiff's public post on Instagram, or that its publication of the Photograph constituted fair use. For the reasons set forth in
the remainder of this Opinion, Defendant's motion is granted in part and denied in part.

[464 F.Supp.3d 600]
BACKGROUND +

A. Factual Background
1. Plaintiff's Allegations

Plaintiff is an individual residing in Los Angeles, California, while Defendant is a limited liability company located in New
York, New York. (Am. Compl. { 4-5). Plaintiff operates a public Instagram account on which he posts photographs he has
taken of landscapes and seascapes. ( See Wolff Decl., Ex. A). On March 13, 2019, Plaintiff posted the Photograph, depicting
a large lake in Death Valley National Park, to his Instagram account. ( See id. , Ex. B).

On March 14, 2019, Defendant published the Article, titled ""Huge Lake Appears in Death Valley, One of the Hottest, Driest
Places on Earth,"" on its website. ( See id. , Ex. C). The Article noted that Plaintiff had captured photographs of the
ephemeral lake and provided some quotes from Plaintiff about his observation of the lake. ( /d. ). Most relevantly to this
action, the Article incorporated Plaintiff's Instagram post of the Photograph, through a process known as embedding. ( See
id. ; Wolff Decl., Ex. I). As ably explained by the Honorable Kimba Wood,

Embedding allows a website coder to incorporate content, such as an image, that is located on a third-party's
server, into the coder's website. When an individual visits a website that includes an ""embed code,"" the user's
internet browser is directed to retrieve the embedded content from the third-party server and display it on the
website. As a result of this process, the user sees the embedded content on the website, even though the
content is actually hosted on a third-party's server, rather than on the server that hosts the website.

Sinclairv. Ziff Davis, LLC , No. 18 Civ. 790 (KMW), 454 F.Supp.3d 342, 343 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13, 2020) (internal citations
omitted). At no point did Plaintiff give his consent to Defendant's use of the Photograph in the Article, nor did Defendant ever
compensate Plaintiff for its use of the Photograph. (Am. Compl. § 10).

On April 1, 2019, Plaintiff registered the Photograph with the United States Copyright Office, with the registration number of
VA 2-145-698. (Am. Compl. 4 9; id. , Ex. B). Two days later, on April 3, 2019, Plaintiff sent a cease and desist letter to
Defendant, providing notice of the putative infringement and requesting that Defendant remove the Photograph from the
Article. ( /d. at § 11). However, Newsweek had not removed the Photograph or taken down the Article as of October 13,
2019. ( Id.).

2. Instagram's Terms of Use 2

Given Defendant's argument that it held a valid sublicense to the Photograph due to


--- Page 2 ---
[464 F.Supp.3d 601]

Plaintiff's decision to post the Photograph publicly on Instagram ( see Def. Br. 13), the Court provides an overview of the
various agreements governing the parties’ use of Instagram. Everyone who signs up to use Instagram agrees to Instagram's
Terms of Use. (Wolff Decl., Ex. D). The Terms of Use prohibit users from ""post[ing] private or confidential information or
do[ing] anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property."" ( /d. , Ex. E at 4). The Terms of Use also
provide that:

[W]hen you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights ..., you hereby grant to
[Instagram] a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute,
modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent
with your privacy and application settings).

(Id.).

Instagram's Privacy Policy, which ""applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service,"" provides that ""other
Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through [Instagram],
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use."" (Wolff Decl., Ex. F at 2). In addition, ""
[s]ubject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other Users and
subject to use under our Instagram API."" ( /d. at 4).2 The Privacy Policy notes that once a user has ""shared User Content or
made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others."" ( /d. ).

Finally, Instagram's Platform Policy governs the use of the API. ( See Wolff Decl., Ex. G at 2). The Platform Policy states
that the Platform is provided ""to help broadcasters and publishers discover content, get digital rights to media, and share
media using web embeds."" ( /d. ). However, the Platform Policy instructs users to ""[c]lomply with any requirements or
restrictions imposed of usage of Instagram photos and videos ... by their respective owners,"" and also prohibits users from
""provid[ing] or promot[ing] content that violates any rights of any person, including but not limited to intellectual property
rights."" ( /d. at 2-3). The Platform Policy provides that the Platform is licensed to users, but ""User Content is owned by users
and not by Instagram."" ( /d. at 4).

B. Procedural Background

Plaintiff initiated this action on October 17, 2019, with the filing of a complaint against Defendant and other unidentified
individuals. (Dkt. #1). On November 13, 2019, the Court scheduled an initial pretrial conference for February 20, 2020. (Dkt.
#8). On December 6, 2019, Defendant informed the Court of its intention to file a motion to dismiss. (Dkt. #13). Plaintiff
responded to Defendant's pre-motion

[464 F.Supp.3d 602]

letter on December 11, 2019. (Dkt. #14). On December 12, 2019, the Court ordered the parties to appear on January 7,
2020, for a pre-motion conference, and adjourned the initial pretrial conference sine die. (Dkt. #15). The parties appeared for
the scheduled pre-motion conference on January 7, 2020, at which time the Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend his
complaint and scheduled briefing for Defendant's contemplated motion to dismiss. (Minute Entry for January 7, 2020).

On January 24, 2020, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint. (Dkt. #17). On February 28, 2020, Defendant filed its motion to
dismiss and accompanying memorandum of law and declaration. (Dkt. #20-22). Plaintiff filed its opposing memorandum,
accompanied by a declaration, on April 13, 2020. (Dkt. #26-27). On April 20, 2020, Plaintiff requested leave to file a
supplemental opposition brief in light of Judge Kimba Wood's decision in Sinclair, ostensibly with Defendant's consent. (Dkt.
#28). The Court granted Plaintiff's request on April 21, 2020 (Dkt. #29), only to be informed the same day by Defendant that
Plaintiff had allegedly misrepresented his intentions regarding the supplemental brief to Defendant (Dkt. #30). In response,
the Court ruled that it would only consider those portions of the supplemental brief that directly addressed Judge Wood's
decision in Sinclair. (Dkt. #31). On May 4, 2020, Defendant filed its reply brief. (Dkt. #34).

DISCUSSION
A. Motions to Dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)

When considering a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court must ""draw all reasonable
inferences in Plaintiffs favor, assume all well-pleaded factual allegations to be true, and determine whether they plausibly
give rise to an entitlement to relief."" Faberv. Metro. Life Ins. Co.__648 F.3d 98 , 104 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks
omitted); see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal__556 U.S. 662 , 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (""To survive a motion to
dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
face."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). A plaintiff is entitled to relief if he alleges ""enough facts to state a claim to relief
that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly_, 550 U.S. 544 , 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) ; see
also In re Elevator Antitrust Litig. , 502 F.3d 47 , 50 (2d Cir. 2007) (""While Twombly does not require heightened fact
pleading of specifics, it does require enough facts to nudge plaintiff's claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.""
(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Twombly. 550 U.S. at 570 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 )).

That said, a court is not bound to accept ""conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions.""
Rolonv. Henneman__517 F.3d 140 , 149 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted);see also Harris v. Mills__572 F.3d
66 , 72 (2d Cir. 2009) (""[A]lthough a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint, that tenet is
inapplicable to legal conclusions, and threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere
conclusory statements, do not suffice."" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting /qbal__556 U.S. at 678 , 129 S.Ct. 1937 )).
Moreover, ""[w]here a complaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a defendant's liability, it ‘stops short of the line
between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.’ "" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 , 129 S.Ct. 1937 (quoting Twombly , 550
U.S. at 557 , 127 S.Ct. 1955 ).

[464 F.Supp.3d 603]
B. The Court Largely Denies Defendant's Motion to Dismiss

In its motion to dismiss, Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff has alleged a viable direct claim of copyright infringement.
Instead, Defendant's motion primarily rests on two independent defenses: (i) Plaintiffs public posting of the Photograph on
Instagram granted Newsweek a sublicense to use the Photograph via Instagram's embedding feature (Def. Br. 12-13), and
(ii) Defendant's use of the Photograph constituted fair use as a matter of law ( id. at 14). The Court addresses each defense
in turn.

1. The Court Cannot Find at This Stage That Defendant Acted Pursuant to a Valid Sublicense

Defendant's first defense is both straightforward and relatively novel. Defendant argues that, per Instagram's various terms
and policies, when Plaintiff chose to post the Photograph publicly on Instagram, he granted Instagram a sublicensable
license to the Photograph. (Def. Br. 13). Newsweek, in turn, embedded the Photograph in the Article using Instagram's API,
and in doing so exercised the sublicense that had previously been granted to Instagram. (Def. Reply 4).

In examining Defendant's argument, this Court does not paint on a blank canvas. Indeed, Judge Kimba Wood examined the
exact same question less than two months ago — whether a web embed of a public post on Instagram can give rise to a
claim of copyright infringement. See generally Sinclair , 454 F.Supp.3d 342. In Sinclair, Mashable — a media website —
published an article in which it embedded a photograph that Sinclair had previously uploaded to and posted publicly on
Instagram. See id. at 343-44. Mashable argued, and Judge Wood held, that pursuant to Instagram's various terms and
policies, Sinclair had ""granted Instagram the right to sublicense"" the photograph at issue, and that ""because Plaintiff
uploaded the Photograph to Instagram and designated it as ‘public,’ she agreed to allow Mashable, as Instagram's
sublicensee, to embed the Photograph in its website."" /d. at 343-46.

The Court finds Judge Wood's decision to be well-reasoned and sees little cause to disagree with that court's reading of
Instagram's Terms of Use and other policies. Indeed, insofar as Plaintiff contends that Instagram lacks the right to
sublicense his publicly posted photographs to other users, the Court flatly rejects that argument. The Terms of Use
unequivocally grant Instagram a license to sublicense Plaintiff's publicly posted content ( see Wolff Decl., Ex. E at 4), and
the Privacy Policy clearly states that ""other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you
make publicly available through"" Instagram ( id. , Ex. F at 2).

Nevertheless, the Court cannot dismiss Plaintiff's claims based on this licensing theory at this stage in the litigation. As
Plaintiff notes in his supplemental opposition brief, there is no evidence before the Court of a sublicense between Instagram
and Defendant. (PI. Supp. Opp. 7-9). Although Instagram's various terms and policies clearly foresee the possibility of
entities such as Defendant using web embeds to share other users’ content ( see Wolff Decl., Ex. G at 2 (noting that
Instagram's Platform exists in part ""to help broadcasters and publishers discover content, get digital rights to media, and
share media using web embeds"")), none of them expressly grants a sublicense to those who embed publicly posted content.
Nor can the Court find, on the pleadings, evidence of a possible implied sublicense. See SHL Imaging, Inc. v. Artisan House,
Inc., 117 F. Supp. 2d 301 , 317 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (noting

[464 F.Supp.3d 604]

that ""[a]n implied license can only exist where an author creates a copyrighted work with knowledge and intent that the work
would be used by another for a specific purpose"" (citing SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare, L.P. v. Watson
Pharms., Inc.,.211 F.3d 21 , 25 (2d Cir. 2000) )).

While the Court acknowledges that it may be possible to read Instagram's various terms and policies to grant a sublicense to
embedders, the Court's role on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is to ""draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor."" Faber, 648
F.3d at 104 . Given the limited review permitted at this stage, the Court cannot find that Defendant acted pursuant to a
sublicense from Instagram. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss on this ground is denied.

2. Defendant's Embedding of the Photograph Did Not Constitute Fair Use as a Matter of Law

As a second, independent reason for dismissal, Defendant argues that its actions constituted fair use. (Def. Br. 14-15). The
Copyright Act, under which Plaintiff brings this suit, is intended ""[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, U.S.
Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8, ""by granting authors a limited monopoly over (and thus the opportunity to profit from) the
dissemination of their original works of authorship,"" Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust.755 F.3d 87 , 95 (2d Cir. 2014). But



--- Page 4 ---
there are also limits upon creators’ control over their own works — in particular, ""the doctrine of ‘fair use,’ which allows the
public to draw upon copyrighted materials without the permission of the copyright holder in certain circumstances."" /d. ""[T]he
fair use determination is an open-ended and context-sensitive inquiry,"" Cariou v. Prince._714 F.3d 694 , 705 (2d Cir. 2013),
but Congress has provided four nonexclusive factors that inform whether a given use is fair:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
17 U.S.C. § 107.

""Fair use is an affirmative defense, and therefore Defendant bears the burden of showing that a given use is fair."" Yang v.
Mic Network, Inc. , 405 F. Supp. 3d 537, 542 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.__804 F.3d 202 , 213 (2d
Cir. 2015) ). ""Courts have granted motions to dismiss infringement claims based on a defendant's fair use defense when
‘discovery would not provide any additional relevant information’ and ‘{a]ll that is necessary for the court to make a
determination as to fair use are the two [works] at issue.’ "" Mayv. Sony Music Entm't , 399 F. Supp. 3d 169, 188 (S.D.N.Y.
2019) (quoting Arrow Prods., Ltd. v. Weinstein Co. , 44 F. Supp. 3d 359, 368 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) ). However, as this Court has
previously observed, ""there is a dearth of cases granting such a motion."" BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, LLC ,
87 F. Supp. 3d 499, 505 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).

a. The Purpose and Character of the Use Factor Favors Plaintiff

The first factor in the fair use inquiry, which has been described as ""[t]he heart of the fair use inquiry,"" Cariou,_714 F.3d at
705 (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Blanch v. Koons, 467 F.3d 244 , 251 (2d Cir. 2006) ),
asks in part whether the new

[464 F.Supp.3d 605]

work ""merely ‘supersede[s] the objects’ of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or
different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message; it asks, in other words, whether and to what
extent the new work is ‘transformative,’ "" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.__510 U.S. 569 , 579,114 S.Ct. 1164 , 127
L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (quoting Folsomv. Marsh, 9 F. Cas. 342, 348 (C.C.D. Mass. 1841) (Story, J.)); Pierre N. Leval, Toward
a Fair Use Standard, 103 HARV. L. REV. 1105, 1111 (1990). The Second Circuit has recognized that

[i]n the context of news reporting and analogous activities, ... the need to convey information to the public
accurately may in some instances make it desirable and consonant with copyright law for a defendant to faithfully
reproduce an original work without alteration. Courts often find such uses transformative by emphasizing the
altered purpose or context of the work, as evidenced by surrounding commentary or criticism.

Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P._, 756 F.3d 73 , 84 (2d Cir. 2014). Yet the Second Circuit has specifically
rejected the contention that commentary is necessary to the fair use defense, holding that ""[t]he law imposes no requirement
that a work comment on the original or its author in order to be considered transformative."" Cariou,_714 F.3d at 706 .
""Instead, ... to qualify as a fair use, a new work generally must alter the original with ‘new expression, meaning, or message.’
""Id. (quoting Campbell__510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). In general, ""the more transformative the new work, the less will
be the significance of other factors ... that may weigh against a finding of fair use."" Barcroft Media, Ltd. v. Coed Media Grp.,
LLC, 297 F. Supp. 3d 339, 351 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ).

The commercial nature of the secondary use is also relevant; ""[t]he greater the private economic rewards reaped by the
secondary user (to the exclusion of broader public benefits), the more likely the first factor will favor the copyright holder and

the less likely the use will be considered fair."" Swatch,_756 F.3d at 83 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks
omitted) (quoting Am. Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.__60 F.3d 913 , 922 (2d Cir. 1994) ); accord Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters._, 471 U.S. 539 , 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218 , 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985) (""The fact that a publication
was commercial as opposed to nonprofit is a separate factor that tends to weigh against a finding of fair use."").

On the other hand, ""purposes such as criticism, comment, [and] news reporting"" are set forth in the Copyright Act as
prototypical examples of fair use, 17 U.S.C. § 107, and the Second Circuit has ""recognized that ‘[a]lmost all newspapers,
books and magazines are published by commercial enterprises that seek a profit.’"""" Swatch,_756 F.3d at 83 (alteration in
original) (quoting Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. v. Gen. Signal Corp... 724 F.2d 1044 , 1049 (2d Cir. 1983) ). Accordingly,
though a work may be commercial in nature, where it is found to be transformative courts ""do not place much significance on
that fact due to the transformative nature of the work."" Cariou_, 714 F.3d at 708 .

Finally, courts considering the first statutory factor are directed to consider whether a defendant acted in bad faith in its use


--- Page 5 ---
of the copyrighted material. See NX/VM Corp. v. Ross Inst.__364 F.3d 471 , 478 (2d Cir. 2004). However, ""while the good or
bad faith of a defendant ... should be considered, it generally contributes little to fair use analysis.""

[464 F.Supp.3d 606]

Ferdmanv. CBS Interactive, Inc. , 342 F. Supp. 3d 515, 531 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting NX/VM Corp._. 364 F.3d at 479 n.2 );
see also Yang , 405 F. Supp. 3d at 546 (""[T]he Second Circuit has cautioned that bad faith is not ‘itself conclusive of the fair
use question, or even of the first factor.’"""" (quoting NX/VM Corp._, 364 F.3d at 479 )).

Comparing the Photograph with its use in the Article, as the Court must do on a motion to dismiss, the Court cannot find as a
matter of law that Defendant's use of the Photograph was transformative. Sister courts have noted that the use of a
copyrighted photograph in a news article can properly be deemed transformative where the photograph itself is the subject
of the story. See, e.g. , Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 534 (finding that use of a photograph in an article was transformative
because the central subject of the article was the existence of, and commentary on, the photograph); Barcroft Media , 297 F.
Supp. 3d at 352 (noting that ""a news report about video that has gone viral on the internet might fairly display a screenshot
or clip from that video to illustrate what all the fuss is about""). But that is not the case here. Plaintiff posted the Photograph
as an illustration of a phenomenon he observed, and Defendant similarly used the Photograph primarily as an illustrative aid
depicting the subject of the Article. See Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 534 (quoting Barcroft Media , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 352 ).
And while it is true that the Article incorporates quotes from Plaintiff about the taking of the Photograph, the mere addition of
some token commentary is not enough to transform the use of a photograph when that photograph is not itself the focus of
the article.

Defendant attempts to bolster its characterization of its use of the Photograph as transformative by relying on Nunezv.
Caribbean International News Corp._. 235 F.3d 18 (1st Cir. 2000) . (Def. Br. 17). InNunez, a professional photographer took
several photographs of Miss Puerto Rico Universe 1997, at least one of which provoked some controversy due to its risqué
nature. See 235 F.3d at 20 . Three of the photographs were subsequently published in the defendant's newspaper, without
the plaintiffs’ permission, as part of articles discussing the controversy around the photographs. See id. The First Circuit, in
finding that the defendant's use was transformative, explained that

[What [was] important ... [was] that plaintiffs’ photographs were originally intended to appear in modeling
portfolios, not in the newspaper.... Thus, by using the photographs in conjunction with editorial commentary, El
Vocero ... used the works for ""a further purpose,"" by giving them a new ""meaning, or message.""

Id. at 23.

In the instant action, Defendant claims that its use was similarly transformative because it took a photograph that was
intended to be ""fine art landscape photography"" and transformed it into news or commentary. (Def. Br. 18). But this draws
too fine a distinction between the parties’ uses. What was important in Nunez was that the defendant imbued the plaintiffs’
photographs with new meaning by transforming them from their original intent — modeling photographs — into the subject of
a news story. Here, Defendant imbued the Photograph with no such new meaning; the Photograph, as already noted, was
incorporated into the Article merely as an illustrative aid. Therefore, Defendant's citation to Nunez is unpersuasive, and the
Court finds that Defendant's non-transformative use of the Photograph causes the first statutory factor to lean in Plaintiff's
‘avor.

The other subfactors that the Court must consider in this first step —
464 F.Supp.3d 607]

he commercial use of the Photograph and whether Defendant's use was in bad faith — do not substantially alter the Court's
analysis. It is clear from the pleadings that Defendant's use was commercial in nature, and Defendant does not dispute that
act. Such a use further weighs against a finding of fair use. See Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 537 (citing Harper & Row,
471 U.S. at 562 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ). Plaintiff also urges the Court to find that Defendant acted in bad faith. (Pl. Opp. 18).
However, there is nothing in the pleadings to suggest one way or another whether Defendant acted in good faith or bad
aith. 4 Therefore, this subfactor neither reinforces nor undermines the Court's finding. The purpose and character of
Defendant's use of the Photograph weighs in Plaintiff's favor. 5

b. The Nature of the Copyrighted Work Factor Favors Neither Party

The second fair use factor is ""the nature of the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107. This factor requires an analysis of ""[i]
whether the work is expressive or creative, ... with a greater leeway being allowed to a claim of fair use where the work is
factual or informational, and [ii] whether the work is published or unpublished, with the scope for fair use involving
unpublished works being considerably narrower."" Cariou, 714 F.3d at 709-10 (alterations in original) (internal citation and
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Blanch__467 F.3d at 256 ). Regarding the former, ""[t]he law generally recognizes a greater
need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy."" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 563 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ; accord
Authors Guild,755 F.3d at 96 (""The second factor considers whether the copyrighted work is ‘of the creative or instructive
type that the copyright laws value and seek to foster.’ "" (quoting Leval, supra, at 1123)). Regarding the latter, ""[t]he fact that a
work is unpublished is a critical element of its ‘nature.’"""" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . Due to the



--- Page 6 ---
importance of the author's right of first publication, ""the unpublished nature of a work is a key, though not necessarily
determinative, factor tending to negate a defense of fair use."" /d. at 554, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (internal alterations, citation, and
quotation marks omitted).

Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, the Court finds that the second factor favors neither party. Although
Defendant does not attempt to argue

[464 F.Supp.3d 608]

that the second factor weighs in its favor — instead asserting that the second factor is largely inconsequential ( see Def. Br.
19) — it certainly seems that the Photograph required some element of creative expression through its framing and
coloration. Indeed, Defendant itself characterized the Photograph as a work of ""fine art landscaping."" ( /d. at 18).
Additionally, neither party addresses whether the Photograph was previously published, although the Court takes judicial
notice of the Photograph's prior publication in the outlet SFGate. See BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, Inc. , 196
F. Supp. 3d 395, 399 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (taking judicial notice of existence of article because it was publicly accessible and
contents were readily ascertainable). Given that the Photograph's creative nature leans in Plaintiff's favor, while its prior
publication weighs in Defendant's favor, the Court views the second factor essentially as a wash.

c. The Amount and Substantiality Factor Favors Neither Party

The third factor in the fair use inquiry is ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work
as a whole."" 17 U.S.C. § 107. In examining this factor courts consider ""the proportion of the original work used, and not how
much of the secondary work comprises the original."" Cariou, 714 F.3d at 710 ; accord Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 565 , 105
S.Ct. 2218 . Ultimately, ""[t]he question is whether ‘the quantity and value of the materials used, are reasonable in relation to
he purpose of the copying.’ "" Blanch, 467 F.3d at 257 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Campbell,_510 U.S. at 586
, 114 S.Ct. 1164 ). As courts have repeatedly emphasized, the inquiry ""calls for thought not only about the quantity of the
materials used, but about their quality and importance, too."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 587 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 ; accord, e.g.,
Hollanderv. Steinberg , 419 F. App'x 44, 47 (2d Cir. 2011) (summary order) (finding reasonable a complete reproduction for
he purposes of litigation).

In the instant action, Defendant reproduced the Photograph in its entirety. However, ""this factor ‘weighs less when
considering a photograph — where all or most of the work often must be used in order to preserve any meaning at all —
han a work such as a text or musical composition, where bits and pieces can be excerpted without losing all value.’ ""
Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 539 (quoting N. Jersey Media Grp. Inc. v. Pirro , 74 F. Supp. 3d 605, 621 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) ).
Given the purpose for which the Photograph was used in the Article, it is difficult for the Court to see how less than the
entirety of the Photograph could have been used. Therefore, even affording Plaintiff the deference his allegations are due at
his stage in the litigation, the Court finds that this factor is neutral. See id. at 539-40 (finding the third factor to be neutral
where no more of the work was taken than necessary).

d. The Effect of the Use Factor Favors Plaintiff

The fourth and final enumerated factor in the fair use inquiry is ""the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
the copyrighted work."" 17 U.S.C. § 107. The Supreme Court has described this factor as ""undoubtedly the single most
important element of fair use."" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 . The Second Circuit has emphasized that

The focus here is on whether defendants are offering a market substitute for the original... [OJur concern is not
whether the secondary use suppresses or even destroys the market for the original work or its potential
derivatives, but

[464 F.Supp.3d 609]
whether the secondary use usurps the market of the original work.

NXIVM Corp. 364 F.3d at 481-82 . Put differently, the focus of the inquiry is ""on whether the copy brings to the marketplace
a competing substitute for the original, ... so as to deprive the rights holder of significant revenues because of the likelihood
that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original."" Yang , 405 F. Supp. 3d at 547 (quoting
Harper & Row. 471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ). Moreover, the Court must question ""not only the market harm caused by
the particular infringement, but also ... whether, if the challenged use becomes widespread, it will adversely affect the
potential market for the copyrighted work."" Barcroft Media , 297 F. Supp. 3d at 355 (quoting Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling
Kindersley Ltd._. 448 F.3d 605 , 613 (2d Cir. 2006) ). ""This inquiry ‘is necessarily intertwined with Factor One; the more the
objective of [the] secondary use differs from that of the original, the less likely it will supplant the commercial market for the
original.’"" Yang , 405 F. Supp. 3d at 547 (quoting Harper & Row._ 471 U.S. at 566 , 105 S.Ct. 2218 ).

Defendant notes correctly that the Amended Complaint alleges no facts regarding the existence of a market for the
Photograph or any usurpation of that market by Defendant's reproduction. (Def. Br. 20-21). However, as previously noted,
the burden of proving fair use is Defendant's, see May , 399 F. Supp. 3d at 187, and therefore it is irrelevant whether Plaintiff
has pleaded market usurpation. Moreover, as the Supreme Court has noted, there is a presumption of market harm ""when a
commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of an original."" Campbell__510 U.S. at 591 , 114 S.Ct. 1164 . As



--- Page 7 ---
already noted in the Court's analysis of the first factor, Defendant's use of the Photograph was both commercial and a mere
duplication of the original, as opposed to constituting a transformative use. Thus, the presumption applies here. See
Ferdman , 342 F. Supp. 3d at 541 (finding a presumption of market harm applicable where the defendant's commercial use
of the infringing photograph was a ""duplication of the entirety of an original""). And given the applicability of the presumption
and the lack of any countervailing considerations in the pleadings, the Court finds that the final factor favors Plaintiff.

In sum, the Court finds that the first and fourth factors favor Plaintiff, while the second and third factors are neutral. Under
these circumstances, it is not possible for the Court to conclude that Defendant's use of the Photograph was fair as a matter
of law. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss based on its alleged fair use of the Photograph is denied.

3. Plaintiff Has Adequately Pleaded Willfulness

In his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has requested that he be awarded statutory damages pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2).
(Am. Compl. { 21, 27). Such enhanced statutory damages are proper only where the copyright owner has sustained the
burden of proving, and the court has found, that the defendant's infringement was committed willfully. 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's request for enhanced damages must be dismissed because Plaintiff has only offered
conclusory allegations to support his prayer for relief. (Def. Br. 21). This, however, is not the case. Plaintiff alleges that he
sent a cease and desist letter to Defendant regarding the Photograph, and that Defendant maintained its use of the
Photograph in spite of that letter. (Am. Compl. § 11). Although the pleadings are sparse, they are enough to

[464 F.Supp.3d 610]

raise a plausible inference that Defendant acted willfully in its infringement of the Photograph. See Gossip Cop , 196 F.
Supp. 3d at 411 (noting that willfulness ""requires only knowledge or reckless disregard on the part of the defendant"").
Accordingly, Defendant's request that Plaintiff's prayer for enhanced damages be dismissed is denied.

C. The Court Grants Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Claims for Contributory and Vicarious Infringement

Defendant has moved to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for contributory and vicarious infringement. (Def. Br. 22-25). Defendant
argues that the Amended Complaint alleges no facts whatsoever to support any theory of secondary liability, and instead
merely recites conclusory language. ( /d. at 23). In order to allege a claim of contributory infringement, a plaintiff must allege
facts showing that the defendant, with knowledge of the infringing activity, materially contributed to the infringing conduct of
a third party. See Smith v. BarnesandNoble.com, LLC , 143 F. Supp. 3d 115, 124 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). By contrast, a claim of
vicarious infringement requires a plaintiff to allege ""that a defendant has declined to exercise the right and ability to
supervise or control the infringing activity [by a third party] and enjoys a direct financial benefit from the infringing activity.""
Rams v. Def Jam Recordings, Inc. , 202 F. Supp. 3d 376, 385 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).

Defendant is correct that the Amended Complaint fails to allege any facts that would support a claim of either contributory or
vicarious liability. Indeed, apart from alleging that unidentified defendants ""contributed to the infringement of Plaintiff's
copyrights, or have engaged in one or more of the wrongful practices alleged herein"" (Am. Compl. 46), there are no facts
supporting the existence of any third parties, as both theories clearly require. All of Plaintiff's allegations regarding his claims
for contributory and vicarious infringement are no more than ""threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,""
Harris , 572 F.3d at 72 , and therefore fail to meet the pleading standards required bylqbal and Twombly . £ Accordingly,
Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for contributory and vicarious infringement is granted.

D. The Court Denies Plaintiff's Request for Leave to Amend

While Plaintiff ""maintains that there are no deficiencies in his [Amended] Complaint,"" he asks the Court for leave to amend
should the Court find his pleadings deficient in any way. (PI. Opp. 23). Although the Court acknowledges that Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) embodies a liberal policy in regard to amendments, Plaintiff's request here is denied. The Court
has already given Plaintiff the opportunity to amend his complaint, with no noticeable change to the specificity of his
allegations, and Plaintiff has offered no indication as to how he would correct the deficiencies in his claims for contributory
and vicarious infringement. Indeed, as already noted, Plaintiff maintains that there are no deficiencies. Under these
circumstances, the

[464 F.Supp.3d 611]

Court sees no reason to give Plaintiff a third bite at the apple. See Rosner v. Star Gas Partners, L.P. , 344 F. App'x 642, 645
(2d Cir. 2009) (summary order) (holding there was no abuse of discretion in denying leave to amend where plaintiffs had
already been given opportunity to amend and offered no indication as to how they would correct deficiencies in complaint).

CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth in this Opinion, Defendant's motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.
Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claim of direct copyright infringement is DENIED, as is Defendant's motion to
dismiss Plaintiff's prayer for enhanced damages. However, Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for contributory
and vicarious infringement is GRANTED. In turn, Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the Amended Complaint is DENIED.

The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motion at docket entry 20. On or before June 22, 2020, Defendant shall file a


--- Page 8 ---
responsive pleading. On or before June 29, 2020, the parties shall submit a proposed Case Management Plan, as well as
the joint status letter contemplated by the Plan.

SO ORDERED.

Notes:

1The facts in this Opinion are drawn from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (""Am. Compl.” (Dkt. #17)), which is the operative pleading in this action. The
Court also relies on the exhibits attached to the Declaration of Nancy E. Wolff (""Wolff Decl., Ex. [ ]"" (Dkt. #22)) insofar as those exhibits show Plaintiff's
Instagram page, the Photograph, and the Article, all of which are incorporated by reference into the Amended Complaint.

For ease of reference, the Court refers to Defendant's opening brief as ""Def. Br."" (Dkt. #21); to Plaintiffs opposing brief as ""PI. Opp."" (Dkt. #26); to
Plaintiff's supplemental opposition brief as ""PI. Supp. Opp.” (Dkt. #28); and to Defendant's reply brief as ""Def. Reply"" (Dkt. #34). The Court also refers to,
but does not rely on, exhibits to the Declaration of Scott Alan Burroughs as ""Burroughs Decl., Ex. [ ]"" (Dkt. #27).

2The Court takes judicial notice of Instagram's Sign-Up Page (Wolff Decl., Ex. D); Instagram's Terms of Use ( id. , Ex. E); Instagram's Privacy Policy ( id.
, Ex. F); and Instagram's Platform Policy ( id. , Ex. G). All four items are publicly accessible; there is no dispute as to the authenticity of the items; and
while the meaning of the terms in the items may be in dispute, the existence of the terms themselves is not. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2) ; Force v.
Facebook, Inc.__934 F.3d 53 , 59 n.5 (2d Cir. 2019) (finding that Facebook's publicly available Terms of Service and Community Standards were subject
to judicial notice). However, the Court notes that the above cited items represent Instagram's terms and policies as of February 28, 2020 ( see Wolff
Decl., Ex. D-G), and may not represent Instagram's current policies and terms.

3The ""API"" or ""application programming interface,” is a service that ""enable[s] users to access and share content posted by other users whose accounts
are set to ‘public’ mode."" Sinclair v. Ziff Davis, LLC , No. 18 Civ. 790 (KMW), 454 F.Supp.3d 342, 344 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13, 2020).

4 Plaintiff urges the Court to take note of a comment allegedly posted on his Instagram post of the Photograph, purporting to be from a Newsweek
reporter and asking for permission to use the Photograph. (Burroughs Decl., Ex. 2). However, this comment is nowhere in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint,
and the Court does not find it proper to take judicial notice of Plaintiff's exhibit. It would therefore be improper for the Court to consider the comment on
this Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See Goel v. Bunge, Ltd.__ 820 F.3d 554 , 559 (2d Cir. 2016) (explaining that courts adjudicating Rule 12(b)(6) motions generally
do not look beyond ""facts stated on the face of the complaint, ... documents appended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by reference, and
... Matters of which judicial notice may be taken"").

2As a final matter, Defendant argues that there ""is a strong presumption that the first factor favors [a] defendant if the allegedly infringing use is among
the illustrative statutory categories of fair use enumerated in [17 U.S.C.] § 107"" (Def. Br. 16), of which categories ""news reporting"" is one, see 17 U.S.C.
§ 107. While such a strong presumption may exist, see Hosseinzadeh v. Klein , 276 F. Supp. 3d 34, 42 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (quoting Wright v. Warner
Books, Inc__953 F.2d 731 , 736 (2d Cir. 1991) ), it is nonetheless clear that the presumption alone is insufficient to support a finding that the first factor
favors Defendant, see, e.g. , BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, LLC , 87 F. Supp. 3d 499, 507 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).

SIt is true that such conclusory language could potentially pass muster were the identities of the third parties or other details regarding Defendant's or the
third parties’ conduct ""peculiarly within the possession and control of the defendant."" See Rosenfeld v. Lenich , 370 F. Supp. 3d 335, 348 (E.D.N.Y.
2019) (quoting Citizens United v. Schneiderman__882 F.3d 374 , 384 (2d Cir. 2018) ). However, Plaintiff has offered no information that might lead the
Court to believe that such is the case.

States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Pauley, J.) granting Appellees’ motion for summary judgment on
the ground that the alleged


--- Page 2 ---
Page 3

copyright infringement was fair use. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and
specification of issues for review.

We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. Blanch v . Koons, 467 F.3d 244 , 249 (2d Cir. 2006).
""Summary judgment should be granted if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to

judgment as a matter of law."" /d. at 250. ""Although fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, this court has on a number
of occasions resolved fair use determinations at the summary judgment stage where there are no genuine issues of material
fact."" /d. (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted).

While the law affords copyright protection to promote the progress of science and useful arts, ""the law has long
recognized that some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials is necessary to promote [that] progress."" TCA
Television Corp . v.McCollum__839 F.3d 168 , 177-78 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). The statutory
framework for analyzing fair use, codified in 17 U.S.C. § 107, provides four nonexclusive factors that should be considered
when deciding if a particular work makes fair use of another:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

These factors are analyzed individually but weighed together. TCA__839 F.3d at 179.

We agree with the district court that Defendants’ use of the ""Jimmy Smith Rap"" in ""Pound Cake"" is fair use. The
statutory factors support our conclusion in this case.

The first factor supports fair use because the use was transformative. A work is transformative when it ""uses the

copyrighted material itself for a purpose, or imbues it with a character, different from that for which it was created."" TCA__ 839
F.3d at 180 . ""Pound Cake"" does just that. The message of the ""Jimmy Smith Rap"" is one about the supremacy of jazz to the
derogation of other types of music, which—unlike jazz—will not last. On the other hand, ""Pound Cake"" sends a counter
message—that it is not jazz music that reigns supreme, but rather all ""real music,"" regardless of genre. App'x at 325.

Beyond the text of the lyrics themselves, ""Pound Cake"" situates its sampling of approximately thirty-five seconds of the
""Jimmy Smith Rap"" at the beginning of an approximately seven-minute-long hip-hop song in which Drake and Shawn Carter,
professionally known as Jay-Z, rap about the greatness and authenticity of their work. Through both the alteration of the
""Jimmy Smith Rap"" and the rest of the rap's lyrics, ""Pound Cake"" emphasizes that it is not the genre but the authenticity of
the music that matters. In this manner, ""Pound Cake"" criticizes the jazz-elitism that the ""Jimmy Smith Rap"" espouses. By
doing so, it uses the copyrighted work for ""a purpose, or imbues it with a character, different from that for which it was
created."" TCA__ 839 F.3d at 180.

We need not spend much time on the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work. This factor ""has rarely played
a significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute,"" and when a work is transformative, the factor may nonetheless
support fair use. Authors Guild v.

Page 4

Google , Inc ., 804 F.3d 202 , 220 (2d Cir. 2015). The district court found that the second factor weighs against a finding of
fair use here. This factor is of ""limited usefulness,"" however, where, as we have determined applies here, ""the creative work
of art is being used for a transformative purpose."" Bill Graham Archives v . Dorling Kindersley Ltd ., 448 F.3d 605 , 612 (2d
Cir. 2006).

The third factor too supports fair use. This factor looks at ""whether the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying."" TCA__839 F.3d at 185
(alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted). We have been clear, however, that ""the law does not require that
the secondary artist may take no more than is necessary."" Cariou v . Prince__714 F.3d 694 , 710 (2d Cir. 2013). ""The
secondary use must be permitted to conjure up at /east enough of the original to fulfill its transformative purpose."" /d.
(brackets, internal quotation marks, and citations omitted). Here, the amount used by Defendants is reasonable. While
""Pound Cake"" borrows language from the ""Jimmy Smith Rap"" detailing the production process for Off the Top , this was
necessary to emphasize its own message: that the ultimate attribute of music is its authenticity, not the production process
that created it.

Finally, the fourth factor also weighs in favor of fair use. ""The final statutory factor considers the effect of the use upon
the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, focusing on whether the secondary use usurps demand for the
protected work by serving as a market substitute."" TCA_, 839 F.3d at 186 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In
the case at hand, there is no evidence that ""Pound Cake"" usurps demand for ""Jimmy Smith Rap"" or otherwise cause a
negative market effect. ""Pound Cake,"" a piece by a hip-hop artist about rap and hip-hop music, appeals to a much different
audience than does ""Jimmy Smith Rap,"" which was a piece by a jazz musician on a jazz album about jazz music. See



--- Page 3 ---
Cariou__714 F.3d at 709 (emphasizing that ""Prince's work appeals to an entirely different sort of collector than Cariou's""). Nor
is there evidence of the existence of an active market for ""Jimmy Smith Rap,"" which is vital for defeating Defendants' fair use
defense. See TCA__839 F.3d at 186-87 ; Cariou__714 F.3d at 709 (weighing in favor of fair use that ""Cariou has not
aggressively marketed his work""); Blanch__467 F.3d at 258 (noting that Blanch had never published or licensed ""Silk
Sandals"" subsequent to its appearance in Allure when holding fair use applied).

We have considered the remainder of Appellants’ arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the order
of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.

ROSS INTELLIGENCE INC., Defendant.

No. 1:20-cv-613-SB
|
Filed February 11, 2025

Synopsis

Background: Company that operated legal-research platform
and parent media company brought action for copyright
infringement and for tortious interference with contract under
state law against competitor, which had entered legal-research
market with product driven by artificial intelligence (AJ),
alleging claims arising from competitor's use of subcontractor
with license to plaintiffs' platform to create materials that
competitor used to develop its product and that were
based on plaintiffs' copyrighted numbering system for legal
topics and plaintiffs' annotations, or headnotes, summarizing
points of law in judicial opinions. The District Court,
Stephanos Bibas, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation, 694
F. Supp. 3d 467, denied summary judgment for plaintiffs on
claims for copyright infringement and contributory copyright
infringement, denied summary judgment for competitor on
its fair-use defense, granted partial summary judgment to
competitor on one aspect of plaintiffs' tortious-interference
claim, and denied summary judgment for plaintiffs on their
tortious-interference claim. At the District Court's invitation,
the parties renewed their summary-judgment motions on the
copyright claims and defenses.

Holdings: The District Court, Stephanos Bibas, Circuit
Judge, sitting by designation, held that:

if plaintiffs sought to try their copyright-infringement claim
ona theory of infringement of headnotes as individual works,
not parts of a compilation, factual disputes about copyright
validity would bar summary judgment of infringement;

WESTLAW

each of plaintiffs' headnotes was sufficiently original to be
eligible as an individual work for copyright protection;

plaintiffs' numbering system for legal topics was sufficiently
original to be eligible for copyright protection;

factual disputes precluded summary judgment on plaintiffs'
copyright-infringement claim as to the numbering system;

factual disputes precluded summary judgment on plaintiffs'
copyright-infringement claims as to 500 judicial opinions and
5,367 headnotes;

plaintiffs established the actual-copying and substantial-
similarity elements of their copyright-infringement claim as
to 2,243 headnotes;

competitor was not protected by the defenses of innocent
infringement, copyright misuse, merger of expression and
idea, or scenes a faire; and

competitor was not protected by the fair-use defense.
Plaintiffs' motion granted in part and denied in part;

competitor's motion denied; court's prior summary-judgment
opinion revised in part and left undisturbed in part.

Procedural Posture(s): Motion for Summary Judgment.

MEMORANDUM OPINION
BIBAS, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation.

*1 A smart man knows when he is right; a wise man knows
when he is wrong. Wisdom does not always find me, so I try to
embrace it when it does—even if it comes late, as it did here.

I thus revise my 2023 summary judgment opinion and order
in this case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); D.L 547, 548;
Thomson Reuters Enter. Ctr. GmbH vy. Ross Intel. Inc., 694
F. Supp. 3d 467 (D. Del. 2023). Now I (1) grant most of
Thomson Reuters's motion for partial summary judgment
on direct copyright infringement and related defenses, D.1.
674; (2) grant Thomson Reuters's motion for partial summary
judgment on fair use, D.I. 672; (3) deny Ross's motion
for summary judgment on fair use, D.I. 676; and (4) deny
Ross's motion for summary judgment on Thomson Reuters's
copyright claims, D.1. 683.

I. ROSS MAKES A LEGAL AI TOOL
AND WESTLAW'S OWNER SUES

The law is no longer a brooding omnipresence in the sky;
it now dwells in legal-research platforms. Thomson Reuters
owns one of the biggest of those platforms: Westlaw. D.1.
752-1 at 4. Users can pay to access its contents, including
“case law, state and federal statutes, state and federal
regulations, law journals, and treatises.” Jd. “Westlaw also
contains editorial content and annotations,” like the headnotes
here. /d. Those headnotes summarize key points of law and
case holdings. Westlaw organizes its content using the Key
Number System, a numerical taxonomy. /d. Thomson Reuters
owns copyrights in Westlaw's copyrightable material. Jd.

Ross, a new competitor to Westlaw, made a legal-research
search engine that uses artificial intelligence. /d. To train its
Al search tool, Ross needed a database of legal questions and
answers. Id. at 5. So Ross asked to license Westlaw's content.
Id. But because Ross was its competitor, Thomson Reuters
refused. Jd. at 4-5.

WESTLAW

So to train its Al, Ross made a deal with LegalEase to
get training data in the form of “Bulk Memos.” Jd. at 5.
Bulk Memos are lawyers’ compilations of legal questions
with good and bad answers. LegalEase gave those lawyers a
guide explaining how to create those questions using Westlaw
headnotes, while clarifying that the lawyers should not just
copy and paste headnotes directly into the questions. D.I.
678-36 at 5-9. LegalEase sold Ross roughly 25,000 Bulk
Memos, which Ross used to train its AI search tool. See D.I.
752-1 at 5; D.I. 769 at 30 (10:48:35). In other words, Ross
built its competing product using Bulk Memos, which in turn
were built from Westlaw headnotes. When Thomson Reuters
found out, it sued Ross for copyright infringement.

In 2023, I largely denied Thomson Reuters's motions for
summary judgment on copyright infringement and the fair-
use defense, and the case moved ahead toward trial. D.I.
547, 548. In the run-up to the August 2024 trial date, I
studied the case materials more closely and realized that my
prior summary-judgment ruling had not gone far enough. So
I continued the trial and invited the parties to renew their
summary-judgment briefing. D.I. 663.

Thomson Reuters once again moved for partial summary
judgment on direct copyright infringement and related
defenses. D.I. 674. Ross moved for summary judgment on
Thomson Reuters's copyright claims. D.I. 683. And both sides
again moved for summary judgment on fair use. D.I. 672, 676.
I now revise parts of my 2023 summary-judgment opinion.
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).

*2 | may grant summary judgment only if there is “no
genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
I view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor
of the nonmovant. Tundo v. County of Passaic, 923 F.3d 283,
286-87 (3d Cir. 2019).

IL. I GRANT PARTIAL SUMMARY
JUDGMENT TO THOMSON REUTERS,
NOT ROSS, ON DIRECT COPYRIGHT
INFRINGEMENT AND RELATED DEFENSES

The dispute boils down to whether the LegalEase Bulk
Memo questions copied Thomson Reuters's headnotes or


--- Page 3 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

were instead taken from uncopyrightable judicial opinions. To
decide many issues here, one must compare the Bulk Memo
questions, headnotes, and opinions side by side. I include the
table below as an example. The questions and headnotes in
this case are sealed. So the headnote and question in this table

Question

Does originality for copyright
purposes mean that the work
was independently created
and has some minimal
degree of creativity?

As | later explain, I hold that:

* Ross infringed 2,243 headnotes. As to those headnotes,
the only remaining factual issue is whether some of their
copyrights have expired.

* Ross's innocent infringement, copyright misuse, merger,
and scenes a faire defenses all fail.

A. Direct copyright infringement

Thomson Reuters alleges that Ross directly infringed its
copyrights. To show that, Thomson Reuters must show both
that (1) it owned a valid copyright and (2) Ross copied
protectable elements of the copyrighted work. Feist, 499 U.S.
at 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282. The second element requires showing
both that (2a) Ross actually copied the work and that (2b) its
copy was substantially similar to the work. Dam Things from
Den. v. Russ Berrie & Co., 290 F.3d 548, 561-62 (3d Cir.
2002).

(i) Copyright validity
Copyright validity is a question of law, not fact, making it
suitable for summary judgment. See Silvertop Assocs. Inc. v.
Kangaroo Mfg. Inc., 931 F.3d 215, 219 (3d Cir. 2019). But an
underlying factual dispute remains here. So the jury may need
to decide this issue, but for reasons different from the ones I
gave in my prior summary-judgment opinion.

Thomson Reuters must show that it had a valid copyright.

Copyright registrations are “prima facie evidence of the
validity of the copyright” if “made before or within five

Thomson Reuters has copyright registrations for Westlaw's
copyrightable content. D.I. 752-1 at 4. And it docketed
registrations from 1981 to 2019. D.I. 1-1. So it has a valid
compilation copyright. But if Thomson Reuters chooses to
try this case based on a theory of infringement of individual
headnotes as individual works rather than infringement of
the compilation as a whole, there is still a factual dispute
about which individual headnotes are both within the period
covered by Thomson Reuters's registrations and not in the
public domain. See D.I. 755, 757, 761, 763. So, if Thomson
Reuters advances a theory of damages that depends on the
infringement of specific headnotes, this evidentiary matter
must be taken up at trial.

In my 2023 opinion, | concluded that this issue would need
to go to a jury, but for a different reason. | held that a jury
would need to decide whether the headnotes and Key Number
System were original enough. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 477-78.

*3 Originality is central to copyright. The Constitution
limits copyright protection to original works. See Feist, 499
U.S. at 346, 111 S.Ct. 1282. So even if Thomson Reuters
gets a presumption of validity because of the copyright
registrations, Ross could rebut the presumption by showing
that the works are not original. | previously thought that
originality “depend[ed] on how much the headnotes overlap
with the [uncopyrightable text of] opinions.” 694 F. Supp.
3d at 478. And | explained that the Key Number System's
originality was a jury question because Ross alleges that
“most of the organization decisions are made by a rote
computer program and the high-level topics largely track


--- Page 4 ---

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

common doctrinal topics taught as law school courses.” /d. at
477 (internal quotation marks omitted).

But the originality threshold is “extremely low,” requiring
only “some minimal degree of creativity .... some creative
spark.” Jd. at 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282. The key question, then,
is whether a work is original, not how much effort went into
developing it. /d. at 359-60, 111 S.Ct. 1282. So I now revise
those parts of my prior opinion. Now | see no genuine dispute
that the headnotes and Key Number System clear Feist’s
minimal threshold for originality.

1. The headnotes are original. A headnote is a short, key point
of law chiseled out of a lengthy judicial opinion. The text of
judicial opinions is not copyrightable. Banks v. Manchester,
128 USS. 244, 253-54, 9 S.Ct. 36, 32 L.Ed. 425 (1888). And
even if it were, Thomson Reuters would not get that copyright
because it did not write the opinions. But a headnote can
introduce creativity by distilling, synthesizing, or explaining
part of an opinion, and thus be copyrightable. That is why I
have changed my mind.

First, the headnotes are a compilation. “Factual compilations”
are original if the compiler makes “choices as to selection and
arrangement” using “a minimal degree of creativity.” Feist,
499 US. at 348, 111 S.Ct. 1282. Thomson Reuters's selection
and arrangement of its headnotes easily clears that low bar.

More than that, each headnote is an individual, copyrightable
work. That became clear to me once | analogized the lawyer's
editorial judgment to that ofa sculptor. A block of raw marble,
like a judicial opinion, is not copyrightable. Yet a sculptor
creates a sculpture by choosing what to cut away and what
to leave in place. That sculpture is copyrightable. 17 U.S.C.
§ 102(a)(5). So too, even a headnote taken verbatim from an
opinion is a carefully chosen fraction of the whole. Identifying
which words matter and chiseling away the surrounding mass
expresses the editor's idea about what the important point of
law from the opinion is. That editorial expression has enough
“creative spark” to be original. Feist, 499 U.S. at 345, 111
S.Ct. 1282. So all headnotes, even any that quote judicial
opinions verbatim, have original value as individual works.

That belated insight explains my change of heart. In my 2023
opinion, I wrongly viewed the degree of overlap between
the headnote text and the case opinion text as dispositive of
originality. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 478. I no longer think that

WESTLAW

is so. But I am still not granting summary judgment on any
headnotes that are verbatim copies of the case opinion (for
reasons that I explain below).

2. The Key Number System is original too. There is no
genuine issue of material fact about the Key Number
System's originality. Recall that Westlaw uses this taxonomy
to organize its materials. Even if “most of the organization
decisions are made by a rote computer program and the high-
level topics largely track common doctrinal topics taught
as law school courses,” it still has the minimum “spark”
of originality. /d. at 477 (internal quotation marks omitted);
Feist, 499 U.S. at 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282. The question is
whether the system is original, not how hard Thomas Reuters
worked to create it. Feist, 499 U.S. at 359-60, 111 S.Ct.
1282. So whether a rote computer program did the work is
not dispositive. And it does not matter if the Key Number
System categorizes opinions into legal buckets that any
first-year law student would recognize. To be original, a
compilation need not be “novel,” just “independently created
by” Thomson Reuters. /d. at 345-46, 111 S.Ct. 1282. There
are many possible, logical ways to organize legal topics by
level of granularity. It is enough that Thomson Reuters chose
a particular one.

*4 Thus, I grant summary judgment for Thomson Reuters

on whether the headnotes and the Key Number System
are original enough to prevent Ross from rebutting any
presumption of validity.

(ii) Copying of original elements
Next, I turn to whether there was “copying of constituent
elements of the work that are original.” Feist, 499 U.S. at 361,
111 S.Ct. 1282. I must decide whether Thomson Reuters has
proven both (a) actual copying and (b) substantial similarity.
Dam Things, 290 F.3d at 561-62.

1. A few preliminaries. Before applying that analysis, | must
determine which parts of the case to apply it to. Ross moves
for summary judgment on all the pieces that Thomson Reuters
accuses Ross of infringing: 21,787 headnotes, the editorial
decisions in 500 judicial opinions, and West's Key Number
System. D.L. 684 at 9-11. I see no proof sufficient to take all
these items away from a jury.


--- Page 5 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

Thomson Reuters, for its part, moves for summary judgment
on only two subsets of the headnotes. D.1. 694 at 20 n.8. The
two batches contain 5,367 and 2,830 headnotes each.

I reach no new decision on the Key Number System. There
are still factual disputes about whether Ross used it and how,
so I cannot analyze what protected elements Ross may have
used. So I leave my prior ruling on this topic in place. Nor
do I decide the fate of the 500 judicial opinions containing
Thomson Reuters's editorial decisions, because there are still
factual questions about how and how much Ross accessed
that material. For now, I consider only the batch of 2,830
headnotes identified by Thomson Reuters.

I leave the 5,367 for trial because Thomson Reuters's
argument for summary judgment on that batch is flawed.
Thomson Reuters points out that after I ordered Ross to
submit a list of headnotes that are verbatim or near-verbatim
quotations of judicial opinions, Ross did not submit these
5,367. D.I. 675 at 24. And it contends that Ross thereby
admitted that these headnotes are protectable. /d. Perhaps
I could view that as a concession about how similar the
headnotes are to the judicial opinions. But Ross's omission
makes no concession about the more important issue: whether
the Bulk Memo questions copied these headnotes, or even
whether the questions are closer to the headnote or to the
judicial opinion. So it is not appropriate to grant summary
judgment to Thomson Reuters on the 5,367 headnotes based
on this reasoning. (Because I did not look at this batch, I
need not address Ross's objection that it had no chance to
respond to Thomson Reuters's expert's opinion on the 5,367
headnotes. D.IL. 749.)

But it is appropriate to address the other 2,830 now at
summary judgment. Before I explain why and how | address
this batch, I must first clean up whether the batch in fact
has 2,830 headnotes. There are two disputes. First, Ross's
expert, Barbara Frederiksen-Cross, put 3,384 headnotes in
this category, but the parties dispute whether 554 of them are
still covered by valid copyright registrations. To resolve this,
I looked at all 3,384 but make summary judgment contingent
on the jury's findings about which 2,830 (or other number)
still have valid copyrights.

Second, Ross claims that Thomson Reuters never asserted

that 1,623 of the 2,830 headnotes were infringed, so at first, I
denied summary judgment on them. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 479.

WESTLAW

Ross says I should again deny summary judgment because
Thomson Reuters did not include these 1,623 headnotes when
lordered it to produce a list of allegedly infringing headnotes.
D.I. 201; D.I. 324 4] 28-30; D.L. 324-23 (Ross's spreadsheet
identifying the 1,623). But on the same day that Thomson
Reuters docketed its interrogatory response lacking those
1,623 headnotes, Ross docketed the expert report conceding
them. D.I. 266-1 at 431 (Frederiksen-Cross's report); D.I.
281-3—281-8 (Thomson Reuters's interrogatory response). So
Thomson Reuters did not have a chance to analyze Ross's
expert report before submitting its list of headnotes. Plus,
Ross had the chance to respond to these 1,623 headnotes when
Thomson Reuters raised them at summary judgment. And
Ross's own expert analyzed them, so there was no danger
of unfair surprise. | revise my prior ruling and now consider
these 1,623 headnotes as fairly part of the case.

*5 Having sorted through that morass, I apply the actual-
copying and substantial-similarity analyses to the 3,384
headnotes, which include the 2,830.

2. Actual copying. Actual copying means that “the defendant
did, in fact, use the copyrighted work in creating his own.”
Tanksley v. Daniels, 902 F.3d 165, 173 (3d Cir. 2018). One
can prove this directly, with evidence that the defendant
copied the work, or indirectly, by showing that the defendant
had access to it and produced something similar (“probative
similarity”). Jd.

When evaluating copying, | may consider expert opinions.
See Kay Berry, Inc. v. Taylor Gifts, Inc., 421 F.3d 199, 208
(3d Cir. 2005). Frederiksen-Cross submitted an expert report
stating that the Bulk Memo questions for this batch closely
resemble the headnotes’ text and that the headnotes differ
significantly from the text of the judicial opinions. D.I. 266-1
at 431, 435; D.I. 675 at 10. Her finding suggests that these
questions were created by copying Westlaw headnotes, not by
summarizing the underlying opinions. I view that as Ross's
expert conceding that the 2,830 were actually copied.

But to make sure, the Court has now compared how similar
each of the 2,830 Bulk Memo questions, headnotes, and
judicial opinions are, one by one. The parties agree that
LegalEase had access to Westlaw and used it to make the
Bulk Memos. Of course, access alone is not proof. But
a Bulk Memo question that looks more like a headnote
than it does like the underlying judicial opinion is strong


--- Page 6 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

circumstantial evidence of actual copying. My comparison of
the questions, headnotes, and opinions can decide whether
probative similarity is present, so long as | think no reasonable
jury could reach a different conclusion. Access plus probative
similarity adds up to evidence of actual copying. To be sure,
there was some confusion at the summary judgment hearing
about whether Ross used all the Bulk Memos. See D.I. 769 at
30 (10:48:35), 162 (14:36:24). Ross's counsel said that some
Bulk Memos were discarded but twice confirmed that Ross
had used 80% for initial training and 20% for later validation.
D.I. 769 at 30 (10:48:35), 162 (14:36:24). So taking counsel
at his word, Ross used practically 100% to train its Al.

Having slogged through all 2,830 headnotes, I grant summary
judgment to Thomson Reuters on actual copying, finding
actual copying of 2,243. Appendix A to this opinion,
filed under seal, catalogues the specific headnotes. I grant
summary judgment only on the headnotes for which actual
copying is so obvious that no reasonable jury could find
otherwise.

3. Substantial similarity. Substantial similarity requires
evaluating whether “the later work materially appropriates
the copyrighted work.” Zanksley, 902 F.3d at 173. That
means deciding which parts of the actually copied work are
original expression and so protected by copyright. Substantial
similarity is often “an extremely close question of fact,” and
thus well suited to the jury. /d. at 171 (internal quotation
marks omitted). But summary judgment can be “appropriate”
when “no reasonable jury could find” otherwise. /d. (internal
quotation marks omitted). The question is whether an
ordinary user of a product would find it substantially similar
to the copyrighted work. Dam Things, 290 F.3d at 562.
As a lawyer and judge, I am myself an ordinary user of
Westlaw headnotes. So I am well positioned to determine
substantial similarity here. I do so cautiously, and only on
those headnotes for which I am confident that a reasonable
jury could not conclude otherwise.

*6 Ross argues that the Bulk Memo questions must be
not just substantially similar to the headnotes, but virtually
identical. The Ninth Circuit takes this approach to “thin”
copyrights because “the range of protectable ... expression
is narrow.” Apple Comput., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 35 F.3d
1435, 1439, 1446 (9th Cir. 1994). But substantial similarity is
always a spectrum, whether the copyright is “thin” or “thick.”
“More similarity is required when less protectable matter is at

WESTLAW

issue.” 4 Nimmer on Copyright § 13D.32[A]. Other terms for
this concept include Nimmer's “supersubstantial similarity”
and the Second Circuit's “more discerning” ordinary-observer
test. Id.; Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd., 71 F.3d 996, 1002—
03 (2d Cir. 1995). Though I do not apply the Ninth Circuit's
test explicitly, | do apply the concept underlying all these
terms: The less protectable expression a work contains, the
more similar the allegedly infringing work must be to it.

Applying this standard, | grant summary judgment on
substantial similarity for Thomson Reuters on the 2,243
headnotes listed in Appendix A, finding that the Bulk
Memo questions were substantially similar to them. Again,
I grant summary judgment only on the headnotes for which
substantial similarity is so obvious that no reasonable jury
could find otherwise. In practice, this means that I am
granting summary judgment only on the headnotes whose
language very closely tracks the language of the Bulk Memo
question but not the language of the case opinion. The rest
of the headnotes must go to trial. I do not grant summary
judgment to Ross on any headnotes because there are none
for which I am confident that a reasonable jury could not find
infringement. I do not decide at summary judgment the factual
question of which headnotes are still covered by Thomson
Reuters's existing copyrights and leave this question open for
trial.

B. Ross's defenses to copyright infringement fail
None of Ross's possible defenses holds water. I reject them all.

First, innocent infringement does not apply. Ross claims that
any infringement was innocent. As the parties agree, innocent
infringement does not limit liability, just damages. 17 U.S.C.
§ 504(c)(2). But this limit does not apply when the infringed
work bears a copyright notice, as Westlaw's headnotes do. 17
U.S.C. § 401(d).

Second, copyright misuse does not apply either. Ross claims
that Thomson Reuters misused its copyright. Copyright
misuse is a defense when a copyright holder weaponizes
the copyright against the public interest, typically for “anti-
competitive behavior.” Video Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista
Home Ent., Inc., 342 F.3d 191, 203-06 (3d Cir. 2003). But
as I already ruled at summary judgment on Ross's antitrust
counterclaims, Ross has not shown that Thomson Reuters
misused its copyrights to stifle competition. D.I. 669.

For Educational Use Only

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

Third, the merger defense is inapt. Ross claims that any ideas
were so close to the expression that they merged with the
expression, making it uncopyrightable. Educ. Testing Servs.
vy. Katzman, 793 F.2d 533, 539 (3d Cir. 1986). But there are
many ways to express points of law from judicial opinions,
so | reject this defense as well.

Fourth, the scenes a faire defense does not fit. This defense
covers stock elements that follow from the work's nature, like
a historical romance novel's damsel in distress. Atari, Inc. v.
N. Am. Philips Consumer Elecs. Corp., 672 F.2d 607, 616
(7th Cir. 1982). But nothing about a judicial opinion requires
it to be slimmed down to Thomson Reuters's headnotes or
categorized by key numbers.

IH. THOMSON REUTERS, NOT ROSS,
PREVAILS ON THE FAIR-USE DEFENSE

There remains one more defense. In my 2023 opinion, I
denied summary judgment on fair use. D.1. 548; 694 F. Supp.
3d at 482-87. But with new information and understanding,
I vacate those sections of that order and its accompanying
opinion addressing fair use. Fair use is an affirmative defense,
so Ross bears the burden of proof. Video Pipeline, 342 F.3d
at 197.

*7 | must consider at least four fair-use factors: (1) the use's
purpose and character, including whether it is commercial or
nonprofit; (2) the copyrighted work's nature; (3) how much of
the work was used and how substantial a part it was relative to
the copyrighted work's whole; and (4) how Ross's use affected
the copyrighted work's value or potential market. 17 U.S.C.
§ 107(1)+(4). The first and fourth factors weigh most heavily
in the analysis. Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202,
220 (2d Cir. 2015) (Leval, J.).

“Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact.” Harper & Row,
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 560, 105
S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). But “[i]n this case, the
ultimate ‘fair use’ question primarily involves legal work.”
Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc., 593 U.S. 1, 24, 141 S.Ct.
1183, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021). The undisputed facts here
push this case squarely into the legal realm. Once we get past
actual copying, the remaining issues that matter are not ones

WESTLAW

of historical fact, intent, or factual prediction. They are about
how to apply the law to the facts. So here, fair use is a question
for the judge, not the jury. Thomson Reuters prevails on the
two most important and on the overall balancing.

A. Factor one goes to Thomson Reuters

First, I consider the purpose and character of Ross's use. 17
U.S.C. § 107(1). [look mainly at whether it was commercial
and whether it was transformative. Andy Warhol Found. for
the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508, 529-31, 143
S.Ct. 1258, 215 L.Ed.2d 473 (2023). If Ross and Thomson
Reuters use copyrighted material like the headnotes for very
similar purposes and Ross's use is commercial, this factor
likely disfavors fair use. /d. at 532-33, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

1. Ross's use is commercial. Ross admits as much. D.I. 727
at 29. It “stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted
material without paying the customary price.” Harper & Row,
471 U.S. at 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218. But commerciality is not
dispositive. | must balance it against how different this work's
purpose or character is. Warhol, 598 U.S. at 525, 143 S.Ct.
1258.

2. Ross's use is not transformative. Transformativeness is
about the purpose of the use. “If an original work and a
secondary use share the same or highly similar purposes, and
the second use is of a commercial nature, the first factor is
likely to weigh against fair use, absent some other justification
for copying.” Warhol, 598 U.S. at 532-33, 143 S.Ct. 1258. It
weighs against fair use here. Ross's use is not transformative
because it does not have a “further purpose or different
character” from Thomson Reuters's. /d. at 529, 143 S.Ct.
1258.

Ross was using Thomson Reuters's headnotes as Al data
to create a legal research tool to compete with Westlaw. It
is undisputed that Ross's Al is not generative Al (AI that
writes new content itself). Rather, when a user enters a legal
question, Ross spits back relevant judicial opinions that have
already been written. D.I. 723 at 5. That process resembles
how Westlaw uses headnotes and key numbers to return a
list of cases with fitting headnotes. Thomson Reuters uses its
headnotes and Key Number System primarily to help legal
researchers navigate Westlaw and (possibly, as the parties
dispute this) to improve Westlaw's internal search tool. D.I.
769 at 14 (10:24:52). The parties agree that Ross and Westlaw


--- Page 8 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

are competitors. D.I. 752-1 at 4. So at first glance, this factor
looks simple.

But, as Ross argues, the headnotes do not appear as part of
the final product that Ross put forward to consumers. The
copying occurred at an intermediate step: Ross turned the
headnotes into numerical data about the relationships among
legal words to feed into its AI. D.I. 727 at 22. That makes this
factor much trickier.

*8 Ross is right that intermediate copying has been
permitted under fair use factor one in analyzing computer
programs. See Google, 593 U.S. at 30-32, 141 S.Ct. 1183;
Sony Comput. Ent., Inc. v. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d 596,
599, 606-07 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that copying source code
to create a product that lets people play Sony games on a
personal computer, rather than a separate Sony game station,
is transformative); Sega Enters. Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977
F.2d 1510, 1514-1515, 1522-23 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that
copying source code to create games that are compatible with
an existing gaming system is transformative).

But those cases are inapt. First and foremost, those cases are
all about copying computer code. This case is not. (Though
Ross did computer programming, the material it allegedly
copied from Thomson Reuters was not computer code.) In
copyright, “computer programs differ from books, films, and
many other literary works in that such programs almost
always serve functional purposes.” Google, 593 U.S. at 21,
141 S.Ct. 1183 (internal quotation marks omitted). So the fair-
use considerations for these programs do not always apply to
cases about copying written words.

Second and relatedly, these computer-programming cases
about intermediate copying rely on a factor absent here:
The copying was necessary for competitors to innovate. In
Google, Google had copied part of a computer-programming
language—specifically, the code that lets programmers speak
to software in a particular way. /d. at 6, 29-33, 141 S.Ct.
1183. That copying was “necessary for different programs to
speak to each other.” /d. at 31, 141 S.Ct. 1183. The copying
in Sony was also necessary. The Ninth Circuit “appl[ied]

fair use to intermediate copying [that was] necessary to
reverse engineer access to unprotected functional elements
within a program.” /d. at 22, 141 S.Ct. 1183. “[I]ntermediate
copying ... was a fair use for the purpose of gaining access
to the unprotected elements of Sony's software.” Sony, 203

WESTLAW

F.3d at 602. Likewise, Sega addressed copying that occurred
“solely in order to discover the functional requirements for
compatibility.” 977 F.2d at 1522. Here, though, there is no
computer code whose underlying ideas can be reached only
by copying their expression. The “copying is [not] reasonably
necessary to achieve the user's new purpose.” Warhol, 598
USS. at 532, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

My prior opinion wrongly concluded that I had to send
this factor to a jury. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 483-84. I based
that conclusion on Sony and Sega. Since then, I have
realized that the intermediate-copying cases (1) are computer-
programming copying cases; and (2) depend in part on the
need to copy to reach the underlying ideas. Neither is true
here. Because of that, this case fits more neatly into the newer
framework advanced by Warhol. 1 thus look to the broad
purpose and character of Ross's use. Ross took the headnotes
to make it easier to develop a competing legal research tool.
So Ross's use is not transformative. Because the AI landscape
is changing rapidly, I note for readers that only non-generative
Al is before me today.

3. Even if relevant, bad faith would not move the needle.
The Supreme Court has expressed “some skepticism about
whether bad faith has any role in a fair use analysis.” Google,
593 U.S. at 32, 141 S.Ct. 1183. If it does, a reasonable jury
might find that Ross, by going forward and arguably inducing
LegalEase's copying after Thomson Reuters refused to license
its content, acted in bad faith. But because Ross's use was
commercial and not transformative, I need not consider this
possible element. Even if I found no bad faith, that finding
would not outweigh the other two considerations.

B. Factor two goes to Ross
*9 Second, | ask about the nature of the original work. 17
U.S.C. § 107(2). That involves “focus[ing] on the degree
of creativity inherent to the work.” 4 Nimmer on Copyright
§ 13F.06. More creative works get more protection. Jd. §
13F.06[A].

Westlaw's material has more than the minimal spark of
originality required for copyright validity. But the material
is not that creative. Though the headnotes required editorial
creativity and judgment, that creativity is less than that of a
novelist or artist drafting a work from scratch. And the Key


--- Page 9 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

Number System is a factual compilation, so its creativity is
limited.

I signaled a similar leaning before. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 484—
85. Yet I stopped short of granting summary judgment based
on factual disputes about how much creativity was involved.
Now, as I concluded above, there is no factual dispute that the
head-notes have creative elements but are far from the most
creative works.

So factor two goes for Ross. Note, though, that this factor “has
rarely played a significant role in the determination of a fair
use dispute.” Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at 220.

C. Factor three goes to Ross

Third, I focus on how much of the work was used and how
substantial a part it was relative to the whole. 17 U.S.C. §
107(3). Lask whether that usage was “reasonable in relation to
the purpose of the copying.” Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music,
Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994). Courts consider both “the quantity of the materials
used” and “their quality and importance.” /d. at 587, 114 S.Ct.
1164. To win on this factor, the alleged copier must not take
the “heart” of the work. /d.

My prior opinion did not decide factor three but suggested that
it leaned towards Ross. The opinion focused on Ross's claim
that its output to an end user is a judicial opinion, not a West
headnote, so it “communicates little sense of the original.”
694 F. Supp. 3d at 485 (quoting Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at
223).

I stand by that reasoning, but now go a step further and decide
factor three for Ross. There is no factual dispute: Ross's output
to an end user does not include a West headnote. What matters
is not “the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
making a copy, but rather the amount and substantiality of
what is thereby made accessible to a public for which it may
serve as a competing substitute.” Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at
222 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Ross did not
make West headnotes available to the public, Ross benefits
from factor three.

In its briefing, Ross emphasized that the number of headnotes

allegedly taken amounted to only a small percentage of the
total headnotes owned by Westlaw. That argument is inapt.

WESTLAW

If taking 300 words out of President Ford's memoirs could
count as taking the heart of the work, so too can taking several
thousand headnotes out of Westlaw. Campbell, 510 U.S. at
587, 114 S.Ct. 1164. The percentage of a total work copied
is neither necessary nor sufficient to decide factor three. But
Ross wins this factor anyway.

D. Factor four goes to Thomson Reuters

Factor four “is undoubtedly the single most important element
of fair use.” Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218.
For this factor, I consider the “likely effect [of Ross's copying]
on the market for the original.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590,
114 S.Ct. 1164. I must consider not only current markets but
also potential derivative ones “that creators of original works
would in general develop or license others to develop.” Jd.
at 592, 114 S.Ct. 1164. I also consider any “public benefits
the copying will likely produce.” Google, 593 U.S. at 35,
141 S.Ct. 1183. The original market is obvious: legal-research
platforms. And at least one potential derivative market is also
obvious: data to train legal Als.

*10 My prior opinion left this factor for the jury. I thought
that “Ross's use might be transformative, creating a brand-
new research platform that serves a different purpose than
Westlaw.” 694 F. Supp. 3d at 486. If that were true, then Ross
would not be a market substitute for Westlaw. Plus, I worried
whether there was a relevant, genuine issue of material fact
about whether Thomson Reuters would use its data to train AI
tools or sell its headnotes as training data. /d. And | thought
a jury ought to sort out “whether the public's interest is better
served by protecting a creator or a copier.” Jd.

In hindsight, those concerns are unpersuasive. Even taking all
facts in favor of Ross, it meant to compete with Westlaw by
developing a market substitute. D.I. 752-1 at 4. And it does
not matter whether Thomson Reuters has used the data to train
its own legal search tools; the effect on a potential market for
Al training data is enough. Ross bears the burden of proof. It
has not put forward enough facts to show that these markets
do not exist and would not be affected.

Nor does a possible benefit to the public save Ross. Yes, there
is a public interest in accessing the law. But legal opinions
are freely available, and “the public's interest in the subject
matter” alone is not enough. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 569,
105 S.Ct. 2218. The public has no right to Thomson Reuters's

parsing of the law. Copyrights encourage people to develop
things that help society, like good legal-research tools. Their
builders earn the right to be paid accordingly. This case is
distinguishable from Google, where the API was valuable
“because users, including programmers, [were] just used to
it.” 593 U.S. at 38, 141 S.Ct. 1183. There is nothing that
Thomson Reuters created that Ross could not have created
for itself or hired LegalEase to create for it without infringing
Thomson Reuters's copyrights.

E. Balancing the factors, I reject Ross's fair-use
defense
Factors one and four favor Thomson Reuters. Factors two and
three favor Ross. Factor two matters less than the others, and
factor four matters more. Weighing them all together, I grant
summary judgment for Thomson Reuters on fair use.

kK KKK

I grant partial summary judgment to Thomson Reuters on
direct copyright infringement for the headnotes in Appendix
A. For those headnotes, the only remaining factual issue on
iability is that some of those copyrights may have expired
or been untimely created. This factual question underlying
copyright validity is for the jury. I also grant summary
judgment to Thomson Reuters against Ross's defenses of
innocent infringement, copyright misuse, merger, scenes a
faire, and fair use. I deny Ross's motions for summary
judgment on direct copyright infringement and fair use. I
revise all parts of my prior opinions that conflict with this
one. I leave undisturbed the parts of my prior opinion not
addressed in this one, such as my rulings on contributory
iability, vicarious liability, and tortious interference with
contract.

v.

ROSS INTELLIGENCE INC., Defendant.

No. 1:20-cv-613-SB
|
Filed February 11, 2025

Synopsis

Background: Company that operated legal-research platform
and parent media company brought action for copyright
infringement and for tortious interference with contract under
state law against competitor, which had entered legal-research
market with product driven by artificial intelligence (AJ),
alleging claims arising from competitor's use of subcontractor
with license to plaintiffs' platform to create materials that
competitor used to develop its product and that were
based on plaintiffs' copyrighted numbering system for legal
topics and plaintiffs' annotations, or headnotes, summarizing
points of law in judicial opinions. The District Court,
Stephanos Bibas, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation, 694
F. Supp. 3d 467, denied summary judgment for plaintiffs on
claims for copyright infringement and contributory copyright
infringement, denied summary judgment for competitor on
its fair-use defense, granted partial summary judgment to
competitor on one aspect of plaintiffs' tortious-interference
claim, and denied summary judgment for plaintiffs on their
tortious-interference claim. At the District Court's invitation,
the parties renewed their summary-judgment motions on the
copyright claims and defenses.

Holdings: The District Court, Stephanos Bibas, Circuit
Judge, sitting by designation, held that:

if plaintiffs sought to try their copyright-infringement claim
ona theory of infringement of headnotes as individual works,
not parts of a compilation, factual disputes about copyright
validity would bar summary judgment of infringement;

WESTLAW

each of plaintiffs' headnotes was sufficiently original to be
eligible as an individual work for copyright protection;

plaintiffs' numbering system for legal topics was sufficiently
original to be eligible for copyright protection;

factual disputes precluded summary judgment on plaintiffs'
copyright-infringement claim as to the numbering system;

factual disputes precluded summary judgment on plaintiffs'
copyright-infringement claims as to 500 judicial opinions and
5,367 headnotes;

plaintiffs established the actual-copying and substantial-
similarity elements of their copyright-infringement claim as
to 2,243 headnotes;

competitor was not protected by the defenses of innocent
infringement, copyright misuse, merger of expression and
idea, or scenes a faire; and

competitor was not protected by the fair-use defense.
Plaintiffs' motion granted in part and denied in part;

competitor's motion denied; court's prior summary-judgment
opinion revised in part and left undisturbed in part.

MEMORANDUM OPINION
BIBAS, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation.

*1 A smart man knows when he is right; a wise man knows
when he is wrong. Wisdom does not always find me, so I try to
embrace it when it does—even if it comes late, as it did here.

I thus revise my 2023 summary judgment opinion and order
in this case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); D.L 547, 548;
Thomson Reuters Enter. Ctr. GmbH vy. Ross Intel. Inc., 694
F. Supp. 3d 467 (D. Del. 2023). Now I (1) grant most of
Thomson Reuters's motion for partial summary judgment
on direct copyright infringement and related defenses, D.1.
674; (2) grant Thomson Reuters's motion for partial summary
judgment on fair use, D.I. 672; (3) deny Ross's motion
for summary judgment on fair use, D.I. 676; and (4) deny
Ross's motion for summary judgment on Thomson Reuters's
copyright claims, D.1. 683.

I. ROSS MAKES A LEGAL AI TOOL
AND WESTLAW'S OWNER SUES

The law is no longer a brooding omnipresence in the sky;
it now dwells in legal-research platforms. Thomson Reuters
owns one of the biggest of those platforms: Westlaw. D.1.
752-1 at 4. Users can pay to access its contents, including
“case law, state and federal statutes, state and federal
regulations, law journals, and treatises.” Jd. “Westlaw also
contains editorial content and annotations,” like the headnotes
here. /d. Those headnotes summarize key points of law and
case holdings. Westlaw organizes its content using the Key
Number System, a numerical taxonomy. /d. Thomson Reuters
owns copyrights in Westlaw's copyrightable material. Jd.

Ross, a new competitor to Westlaw, made a legal-research
search engine that uses artificial intelligence. /d. To train its
Al search tool, Ross needed a database of legal questions and
answers. Id. at 5. So Ross asked to license Westlaw's content.
Id. But because Ross was its competitor, Thomson Reuters
refused. Jd. at 4-5.

WESTLAW

So to train its Al, Ross made a deal with LegalEase to
get training data in the form of “Bulk Memos.” Jd. at 5.
Bulk Memos are lawyers’ compilations of legal questions
with good and bad answers. LegalEase gave those lawyers a
guide explaining how to create those questions using Westlaw
headnotes, while clarifying that the lawyers should not just
copy and paste headnotes directly into the questions. D.I.
678-36 at 5-9. LegalEase sold Ross roughly 25,000 Bulk
Memos, which Ross used to train its AI search tool. See D.I.
752-1 at 5; D.I. 769 at 30 (10:48:35). In other words, Ross
built its competing product using Bulk Memos, which in turn
were built from Westlaw headnotes. When Thomson Reuters
found out, it sued Ross for copyright infringement.

In 2023, I largely denied Thomson Reuters's motions for
summary judgment on copyright infringement and the fair-
use defense, and the case moved ahead toward trial. D.I.
547, 548. In the run-up to the August 2024 trial date, I
studied the case materials more closely and realized that my
prior summary-judgment ruling had not gone far enough. So
I continued the trial and invited the parties to renew their
summary-judgment briefing. D.I. 663.

Thomson Reuters once again moved for partial summary
judgment on direct copyright infringement and related
defenses. D.I. 674. Ross moved for summary judgment on
Thomson Reuters's copyright claims. D.I. 683. And both sides
again moved for summary judgment on fair use. D.I. 672, 676.
I now revise parts of my 2023 summary-judgment opinion.
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).

*2 | may grant summary judgment only if there is “no
genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
I view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor
of the nonmovant. Tundo v. County of Passaic, 923 F.3d 283,
286-87 (3d Cir. 2019).

IL. I GRANT PARTIAL SUMMARY
JUDGMENT TO THOMSON REUTERS,
NOT ROSS, ON DIRECT COPYRIGHT
INFRINGEMENT AND RELATED DEFENSES

The dispute boils down to whether the LegalEase Bulk
Memo questions copied Thomson Reuters's headnotes or

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

were instead taken from uncopyrightable judicial opinions. To
decide many issues here, one must compare the Bulk Memo
questions, headnotes, and opinions side by side. I include the
table below as an example. The questions and headnotes in
this case are sealed. So the headnote and question in this table

Question

Does originality for copyright
purposes mean that the work
was independently created
and has some minimal
degree of creativity?

As | later explain, I hold that:

* Ross infringed 2,243 headnotes. As to those headnotes,
the only remaining factual issue is whether some of their
copyrights have expired.

* Ross's innocent infringement, copyright misuse, merger,
and scenes a faire defenses all fail.

A. Direct copyright infringement

Thomson Reuters alleges that Ross directly infringed its
copyrights. To show that, Thomson Reuters must show both
that (1) it owned a valid copyright and (2) Ross copied
protectable elements of the copyrighted work. Feist, 499 U.S.
at 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282. The second element requires showing
both that (2a) Ross actually copied the work and that (2b) its
copy was substantially similar to the work. Dam Things from
Den. v. Russ Berrie & Co., 290 F.3d 548, 561-62 (3d Cir.
2002).

(i) Copyright validity
Copyright validity is a question of law, not fact, making it
suitable for summary judgment. See Silvertop Assocs. Inc. v.
Kangaroo Mfg. Inc., 931 F.3d 215, 219 (3d Cir. 2019). But an
underlying factual dispute remains here. So the jury may need
to decide this issue, but for reasons different from the ones I
gave in my prior summary-judgment opinion.

Thomson Reuters must show that it had a valid copyright.

Copyright registrations are “prima facie evidence of the
validity of the copyright” if “made before or within five

are not actual materials from the record, but an example |
created based on Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv.
Co., 499 U.S. 340, 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358
(1991).

Case Opinion

Original, as the term is used
in copyright, means only that
the work was independently
created by the author (as
opposed to copied from other
works), and that it possesses
at least some minimal degree
of creativity.

years after first publication of the work.” 17 U.S.C. § 410(c).
Thomson Reuters has copyright registrations for Westlaw's
copyrightable content. D.I. 752-1 at 4. And it docketed
registrations from 1981 to 2019. D.I. 1-1. So it has a valid
compilation copyright. But if Thomson Reuters chooses to
try this case based on a theory of infringement of individual
headnotes as individual works rather than infringement of
the compilation as a whole, there is still a factual dispute
about which individual headnotes are both within the period
covered by Thomson Reuters's registrations and not in the
public domain. See D.I. 755, 757, 761, 763. So, if Thomson
Reuters advances a theory of damages that depends on the
infringement of specific headnotes, this evidentiary matter
must be taken up at trial.

In my 2023 opinion, | concluded that this issue would need
to go to a jury, but for a different reason. | held that a jury
would need to decide whether the headnotes and Key Number
System were original enough. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 477-78.

*3 Originality is central to copyright. The Constitution
limits copyright protection to original works. See Feist, 499
U.S. at 346, 111 S.Ct. 1282. So even if Thomson Reuters
gets a presumption of validity because of the copyright
registrations, Ross could rebut the presumption by showing
that the works are not original. | previously thought that
originality “depend[ed] on how much the headnotes overlap
with the [uncopyrightable text of] opinions.” 694 F. Supp.
3d at 478. And | explained that the Key Number System's
originality was a jury question because Ross alleges that
“most of the organization decisions are made by a rote
computer program and the high-level topics largely track


--- Page 4 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

common doctrinal topics taught as law school courses.” /d. at
477 (internal quotation marks omitted).

But the originality threshold is “extremely low,” requiring
only “some minimal degree of creativity .... some creative
spark.” Jd. at 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282. The key question, then,
is whether a work is original, not how much effort went into
developing it. /d. at 359-60, 111 S.Ct. 1282. So I now revise
those parts of my prior opinion. Now | see no genuine dispute
that the headnotes and Key Number System clear Feist’s
minimal threshold for originality.

1. The headnotes are original. A headnote is a short, key point
of law chiseled out of a lengthy judicial opinion. The text of
judicial opinions is not copyrightable. Banks v. Manchester,
128 USS. 244, 253-54, 9 S.Ct. 36, 32 L.Ed. 425 (1888). And
even if it were, Thomson Reuters would not get that copyright
because it did not write the opinions. But a headnote can
introduce creativity by distilling, synthesizing, or explaining
part of an opinion, and thus be copyrightable. That is why I
have changed my mind.

First, the headnotes are a compilation. “Factual compilations”
are original if the compiler makes “choices as to selection and
arrangement” using “a minimal degree of creativity.” Feist,
499 US. at 348, 111 S.Ct. 1282. Thomson Reuters's selection
and arrangement of its headnotes easily clears that low bar.

More than that, each headnote is an individual, copyrightable
work. That became clear to me once | analogized the lawyer's
editorial judgment to that ofa sculptor. A block of raw marble,
like a judicial opinion, is not copyrightable. Yet a sculptor
creates a sculpture by choosing what to cut away and what
to leave in place. That sculpture is copyrightable. 17 U.S.C.
§ 102(a)(5). So too, even a headnote taken verbatim from an
opinion is a carefully chosen fraction of the whole. Identifying
which words matter and chiseling away the surrounding mass
expresses the editor's idea about what the important point of
law from the opinion is. That editorial expression has enough
“creative spark” to be original. Feist, 499 U.S. at 345, 111
S.Ct. 1282. So all headnotes, even any that quote judicial
opinions verbatim, have original value as individual works.

That belated insight explains my change of heart. In my 2023
opinion, I wrongly viewed the degree of overlap between
the headnote text and the case opinion text as dispositive of
originality. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 478. I no longer think that

WESTLAW

is so. But I am still not granting summary judgment on any
headnotes that are verbatim copies of the case opinion (for
reasons that I explain below).

2. The Key Number System is original too. There is no
genuine issue of material fact about the Key Number
System's originality. Recall that Westlaw uses this taxonomy
to organize its materials. Even if “most of the organization
decisions are made by a rote computer program and the high-
level topics largely track common doctrinal topics taught
as law school courses,” it still has the minimum “spark”
of originality. /d. at 477 (internal quotation marks omitted);
Feist, 499 U.S. at 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282. The question is
whether the system is original, not how hard Thomas Reuters
worked to create it. Feist, 499 U.S. at 359-60, 111 S.Ct.
1282. So whether a rote computer program did the work is
not dispositive. And it does not matter if the Key Number
System categorizes opinions into legal buckets that any
first-year law student would recognize. To be original, a
compilation need not be “novel,” just “independently created
by” Thomson Reuters. /d. at 345-46, 111 S.Ct. 1282. There
are many possible, logical ways to organize legal topics by
level of granularity. It is enough that Thomson Reuters chose
a particular one.

*4 Thus, I grant summary judgment for Thomson Reuters

on whether the headnotes and the Key Number System
are original enough to prevent Ross from rebutting any
presumption of validity.

(ii) Copying of original elements
Next, I turn to whether there was “copying of constituent
elements of the work that are original.” Feist, 499 U.S. at 361,
111 S.Ct. 1282. I must decide whether Thomson Reuters has
proven both (a) actual copying and (b) substantial similarity.
Dam Things, 290 F.3d at 561-62.

1. A few preliminaries. Before applying that analysis, | must
determine which parts of the case to apply it to. Ross moves
for summary judgment on all the pieces that Thomson Reuters
accuses Ross of infringing: 21,787 headnotes, the editorial
decisions in 500 judicial opinions, and West's Key Number
System. D.L. 684 at 9-11. I see no proof sufficient to take all
these items away from a jury.


--- Page 5 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

Thomson Reuters, for its part, moves for summary judgment
on only two subsets of the headnotes. D.1. 694 at 20 n.8. The
two batches contain 5,367 and 2,830 headnotes each.

I reach no new decision on the Key Number System. There
are still factual disputes about whether Ross used it and how,
so I cannot analyze what protected elements Ross may have
used. So I leave my prior ruling on this topic in place. Nor
do I decide the fate of the 500 judicial opinions containing
Thomson Reuters's editorial decisions, because there are still
factual questions about how and how much Ross accessed
that material. For now, I consider only the batch of 2,830
headnotes identified by Thomson Reuters.

I leave the 5,367 for trial because Thomson Reuters's
argument for summary judgment on that batch is flawed.
Thomson Reuters points out that after I ordered Ross to
submit a list of headnotes that are verbatim or near-verbatim
quotations of judicial opinions, Ross did not submit these
5,367. D.I. 675 at 24. And it contends that Ross thereby
admitted that these headnotes are protectable. /d. Perhaps
I could view that as a concession about how similar the
headnotes are to the judicial opinions. But Ross's omission
makes no concession about the more important issue: whether
the Bulk Memo questions copied these headnotes, or even
whether the questions are closer to the headnote or to the
judicial opinion. So it is not appropriate to grant summary
judgment to Thomson Reuters on the 5,367 headnotes based
on this reasoning. (Because I did not look at this batch, I
need not address Ross's objection that it had no chance to
respond to Thomson Reuters's expert's opinion on the 5,367
headnotes. D.IL. 749.)

But it is appropriate to address the other 2,830 now at
summary judgment. Before I explain why and how | address
this batch, I must first clean up whether the batch in fact
has 2,830 headnotes. There are two disputes. First, Ross's
expert, Barbara Frederiksen-Cross, put 3,384 headnotes in
this category, but the parties dispute whether 554 of them are
still covered by valid copyright registrations. To resolve this,
I looked at all 3,384 but make summary judgment contingent
on the jury's findings about which 2,830 (or other number)
still have valid copyrights.

Second, Ross claims that Thomson Reuters never asserted

that 1,623 of the 2,830 headnotes were infringed, so at first, I
denied summary judgment on them. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 479.

WESTLAW

Ross says I should again deny summary judgment because
Thomson Reuters did not include these 1,623 headnotes when
lordered it to produce a list of allegedly infringing headnotes.
D.I. 201; D.I. 324 4] 28-30; D.L. 324-23 (Ross's spreadsheet
identifying the 1,623). But on the same day that Thomson
Reuters docketed its interrogatory response lacking those
1,623 headnotes, Ross docketed the expert report conceding
them. D.I. 266-1 at 431 (Frederiksen-Cross's report); D.I.
281-3—281-8 (Thomson Reuters's interrogatory response). So
Thomson Reuters did not have a chance to analyze Ross's
expert report before submitting its list of headnotes. Plus,
Ross had the chance to respond to these 1,623 headnotes when
Thomson Reuters raised them at summary judgment. And
Ross's own expert analyzed them, so there was no danger
of unfair surprise. | revise my prior ruling and now consider
these 1,623 headnotes as fairly part of the case.

*5 Having sorted through that morass, I apply the actual-
copying and substantial-similarity analyses to the 3,384
headnotes, which include the 2,830.

2. Actual copying. Actual copying means that “the defendant
did, in fact, use the copyrighted work in creating his own.”
Tanksley v. Daniels, 902 F.3d 165, 173 (3d Cir. 2018). One
can prove this directly, with evidence that the defendant
copied the work, or indirectly, by showing that the defendant
had access to it and produced something similar (“probative
similarity”). Jd.

When evaluating copying, | may consider expert opinions.
See Kay Berry, Inc. v. Taylor Gifts, Inc., 421 F.3d 199, 208
(3d Cir. 2005). Frederiksen-Cross submitted an expert report
stating that the Bulk Memo questions for this batch closely
resemble the headnotes’ text and that the headnotes differ
significantly from the text of the judicial opinions. D.I. 266-1
at 431, 435; D.I. 675 at 10. Her finding suggests that these
questions were created by copying Westlaw headnotes, not by
summarizing the underlying opinions. I view that as Ross's
expert conceding that the 2,830 were actually copied.

But to make sure, the Court has now compared how similar
each of the 2,830 Bulk Memo questions, headnotes, and
judicial opinions are, one by one. The parties agree that
LegalEase had access to Westlaw and used it to make the
Bulk Memos. Of course, access alone is not proof. But
a Bulk Memo question that looks more like a headnote
than it does like the underlying judicial opinion is strong

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

circumstantial evidence of actual copying. My comparison of
the questions, headnotes, and opinions can decide whether
probative similarity is present, so long as | think no reasonable
jury could reach a different conclusion. Access plus probative
similarity adds up to evidence of actual copying. To be sure,
there was some confusion at the summary judgment hearing
about whether Ross used all the Bulk Memos. See D.I. 769 at
30 (10:48:35), 162 (14:36:24). Ross's counsel said that some
Bulk Memos were discarded but twice confirmed that Ross
had used 80% for initial training and 20% for later validation.
D.I. 769 at 30 (10:48:35), 162 (14:36:24). So taking counsel
at his word, Ross used practically 100% to train its Al.

Having slogged through all 2,830 headnotes, I grant summary
judgment to Thomson Reuters on actual copying, finding
actual copying of 2,243. Appendix A to this opinion,
filed under seal, catalogues the specific headnotes. I grant
summary judgment only on the headnotes for which actual
copying is so obvious that no reasonable jury could find
otherwise.

3. Substantial similarity. Substantial similarity requires
evaluating whether “the later work materially appropriates
the copyrighted work.” Zanksley, 902 F.3d at 173. That
means deciding which parts of the actually copied work are
original expression and so protected by copyright. Substantial
similarity is often “an extremely close question of fact,” and
thus well suited to the jury. /d. at 171 (internal quotation
marks omitted). But summary judgment can be “appropriate”
when “no reasonable jury could find” otherwise. /d. (internal
quotation marks omitted). The question is whether an
ordinary user of a product would find it substantially similar
to the copyrighted work. Dam Things, 290 F.3d at 562.
As a lawyer and judge, I am myself an ordinary user of
Westlaw headnotes. So I am well positioned to determine
substantial similarity here. I do so cautiously, and only on
those headnotes for which I am confident that a reasonable
jury could not conclude otherwise.

*6 Ross argues that the Bulk Memo questions must be
not just substantially similar to the headnotes, but virtually
identical. The Ninth Circuit takes this approach to “thin”
copyrights because “the range of protectable ... expression
is narrow.” Apple Comput., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 35 F.3d
1435, 1439, 1446 (9th Cir. 1994). But substantial similarity is
always a spectrum, whether the copyright is “thin” or “thick.”
“More similarity is required when less protectable matter is at

WESTLAW

issue.” 4 Nimmer on Copyright § 13D.32[A]. Other terms for
this concept include Nimmer's “supersubstantial similarity”
and the Second Circuit's “more discerning” ordinary-observer
test. Id.; Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd., 71 F.3d 996, 1002—
03 (2d Cir. 1995). Though I do not apply the Ninth Circuit's
test explicitly, | do apply the concept underlying all these
terms: The less protectable expression a work contains, the
more similar the allegedly infringing work must be to it.

Applying this standard, | grant summary judgment on
substantial similarity for Thomson Reuters on the 2,243
headnotes listed in Appendix A, finding that the Bulk
Memo questions were substantially similar to them. Again,
I grant summary judgment only on the headnotes for which
substantial similarity is so obvious that no reasonable jury
could find otherwise. In practice, this means that I am
granting summary judgment only on the headnotes whose
language very closely tracks the language of the Bulk Memo
question but not the language of the case opinion. The rest
of the headnotes must go to trial. I do not grant summary
judgment to Ross on any headnotes because there are none
for which I am confident that a reasonable jury could not find
infringement. I do not decide at summary judgment the factual
question of which headnotes are still covered by Thomson
Reuters's existing copyrights and leave this question open for
trial.

B. Ross's defenses to copyright infringement fail
None of Ross's possible defenses holds water. I reject them all.

First, innocent infringement does not apply. Ross claims that
any infringement was innocent. As the parties agree, innocent
infringement does not limit liability, just damages. 17 U.S.C.
§ 504(c)(2). But this limit does not apply when the infringed
work bears a copyright notice, as Westlaw's headnotes do. 17
U.S.C. § 401(d).

Second, copyright misuse does not apply either. Ross claims
that Thomson Reuters misused its copyright. Copyright
misuse is a defense when a copyright holder weaponizes
the copyright against the public interest, typically for “anti-
competitive behavior.” Video Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista
Home Ent., Inc., 342 F.3d 191, 203-06 (3d Cir. 2003). But
as I already ruled at summary judgment on Ross's antitrust
counterclaims, Ross has not shown that Thomson Reuters
misused its copyrights to stifle competition. D.I. 669.

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

Third, the merger defense is inapt. Ross claims that any ideas
were so close to the expression that they merged with the
expression, making it uncopyrightable. Educ. Testing Servs.
vy. Katzman, 793 F.2d 533, 539 (3d Cir. 1986). But there are
many ways to express points of law from judicial opinions,
so | reject this defense as well.

Fourth, the scenes a faire defense does not fit. This defense
covers stock elements that follow from the work's nature, like
a historical romance novel's damsel in distress. Atari, Inc. v.
N. Am. Philips Consumer Elecs. Corp., 672 F.2d 607, 616
(7th Cir. 1982). But nothing about a judicial opinion requires
it to be slimmed down to Thomson Reuters's headnotes or
categorized by key numbers.

IH. THOMSON REUTERS, NOT ROSS,
PREVAILS ON THE FAIR-USE DEFENSE

There remains one more defense. In my 2023 opinion, I
denied summary judgment on fair use. D.1. 548; 694 F. Supp.
3d at 482-87. But with new information and understanding,
I vacate those sections of that order and its accompanying
opinion addressing fair use. Fair use is an affirmative defense,
so Ross bears the burden of proof. Video Pipeline, 342 F.3d
at 197.

*7 | must consider at least four fair-use factors: (1) the use's
purpose and character, including whether it is commercial or
nonprofit; (2) the copyrighted work's nature; (3) how much of
the work was used and how substantial a part it was relative to
the copyrighted work's whole; and (4) how Ross's use affected
the copyrighted work's value or potential market. 17 U.S.C.
§ 107(1)+(4). The first and fourth factors weigh most heavily
in the analysis. Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202,
220 (2d Cir. 2015) (Leval, J.).

“Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact.” Harper & Row,
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 560, 105
S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). But “[i]n this case, the
ultimate ‘fair use’ question primarily involves legal work.”
Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc., 593 U.S. 1, 24, 141 S.Ct.
1183, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021). The undisputed facts here
push this case squarely into the legal realm. Once we get past
actual copying, the remaining issues that matter are not ones

WESTLAW

of historical fact, intent, or factual prediction. They are about
how to apply the law to the facts. So here, fair use is a question
for the judge, not the jury. Thomson Reuters prevails on the
two most important and on the overall balancing.

A. Factor one goes to Thomson Reuters

First, I consider the purpose and character of Ross's use. 17
U.S.C. § 107(1). [look mainly at whether it was commercial
and whether it was transformative. Andy Warhol Found. for
the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508, 529-31, 143
S.Ct. 1258, 215 L.Ed.2d 473 (2023). If Ross and Thomson
Reuters use copyrighted material like the headnotes for very
similar purposes and Ross's use is commercial, this factor
likely disfavors fair use. /d. at 532-33, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

1. Ross's use is commercial. Ross admits as much. D.I. 727
at 29. It “stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted
material without paying the customary price.” Harper & Row,
471 U.S. at 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218. But commerciality is not
dispositive. | must balance it against how different this work's
purpose or character is. Warhol, 598 U.S. at 525, 143 S.Ct.
1258.

2. Ross's use is not transformative. Transformativeness is
about the purpose of the use. “If an original work and a
secondary use share the same or highly similar purposes, and
the second use is of a commercial nature, the first factor is
likely to weigh against fair use, absent some other justification
for copying.” Warhol, 598 U.S. at 532-33, 143 S.Ct. 1258. It
weighs against fair use here. Ross's use is not transformative
because it does not have a “further purpose or different
character” from Thomson Reuters's. /d. at 529, 143 S.Ct.
1258.

Ross was using Thomson Reuters's headnotes as Al data
to create a legal research tool to compete with Westlaw. It
is undisputed that Ross's Al is not generative Al (AI that
writes new content itself). Rather, when a user enters a legal
question, Ross spits back relevant judicial opinions that have
already been written. D.I. 723 at 5. That process resembles
how Westlaw uses headnotes and key numbers to return a
list of cases with fitting headnotes. Thomson Reuters uses its
headnotes and Key Number System primarily to help legal
researchers navigate Westlaw and (possibly, as the parties
dispute this) to improve Westlaw's internal search tool. D.I.
769 at 14 (10:24:52). The parties agree that Ross and Westlaw


--- Page 8 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

are competitors. D.I. 752-1 at 4. So at first glance, this factor
looks simple.

But, as Ross argues, the headnotes do not appear as part of
the final product that Ross put forward to consumers. The
copying occurred at an intermediate step: Ross turned the
headnotes into numerical data about the relationships among
legal words to feed into its AI. D.I. 727 at 22. That makes this
factor much trickier.

*8 Ross is right that intermediate copying has been
permitted under fair use factor one in analyzing computer
programs. See Google, 593 U.S. at 30-32, 141 S.Ct. 1183;
Sony Comput. Ent., Inc. v. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d 596,
599, 606-07 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that copying source code
to create a product that lets people play Sony games on a
personal computer, rather than a separate Sony game station,
is transformative); Sega Enters. Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977
F.2d 1510, 1514-1515, 1522-23 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that
copying source code to create games that are compatible with
an existing gaming system is transformative).

But those cases are inapt. First and foremost, those cases are
all about copying computer code. This case is not. (Though
Ross did computer programming, the material it allegedly
copied from Thomson Reuters was not computer code.) In
copyright, “computer programs differ from books, films, and
many other literary works in that such programs almost
always serve functional purposes.” Google, 593 U.S. at 21,
141 S.Ct. 1183 (internal quotation marks omitted). So the fair-
use considerations for these programs do not always apply to
cases about copying written words.

Second and relatedly, these computer-programming cases
about intermediate copying rely on a factor absent here:
The copying was necessary for competitors to innovate. In
Google, Google had copied part of a computer-programming
language—specifically, the code that lets programmers speak
to software in a particular way. /d. at 6, 29-33, 141 S.Ct.
1183. That copying was “necessary for different programs to
speak to each other.” /d. at 31, 141 S.Ct. 1183. The copying
in Sony was also necessary. The Ninth Circuit “appl[ied]

fair use to intermediate copying [that was] necessary to
reverse engineer access to unprotected functional elements
within a program.” /d. at 22, 141 S.Ct. 1183. “[I]ntermediate
copying ... was a fair use for the purpose of gaining access
to the unprotected elements of Sony's software.” Sony, 203

WESTLAW

F.3d at 602. Likewise, Sega addressed copying that occurred
“solely in order to discover the functional requirements for
compatibility.” 977 F.2d at 1522. Here, though, there is no
computer code whose underlying ideas can be reached only
by copying their expression. The “copying is [not] reasonably
necessary to achieve the user's new purpose.” Warhol, 598
USS. at 532, 143 S.Ct. 1258.

My prior opinion wrongly concluded that I had to send
this factor to a jury. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 483-84. I based
that conclusion on Sony and Sega. Since then, I have
realized that the intermediate-copying cases (1) are computer-
programming copying cases; and (2) depend in part on the
need to copy to reach the underlying ideas. Neither is true
here. Because of that, this case fits more neatly into the newer
framework advanced by Warhol. 1 thus look to the broad
purpose and character of Ross's use. Ross took the headnotes
to make it easier to develop a competing legal research tool.
So Ross's use is not transformative. Because the AI landscape
is changing rapidly, I note for readers that only non-generative
Al is before me today.

3. Even if relevant, bad faith would not move the needle.
The Supreme Court has expressed “some skepticism about
whether bad faith has any role in a fair use analysis.” Google,
593 U.S. at 32, 141 S.Ct. 1183. If it does, a reasonable jury
might find that Ross, by going forward and arguably inducing
LegalEase's copying after Thomson Reuters refused to license
its content, acted in bad faith. But because Ross's use was
commercial and not transformative, I need not consider this
possible element. Even if I found no bad faith, that finding
would not outweigh the other two considerations.

B. Factor two goes to Ross
*9 Second, | ask about the nature of the original work. 17
U.S.C. § 107(2). That involves “focus[ing] on the degree
of creativity inherent to the work.” 4 Nimmer on Copyright
§ 13F.06. More creative works get more protection. Jd. §
13F.06[A].

Westlaw's material has more than the minimal spark of
originality required for copyright validity. But the material
is not that creative. Though the headnotes required editorial
creativity and judgment, that creativity is less than that of a
novelist or artist drafting a work from scratch. And the Key


--- Page 9 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

Number System is a factual compilation, so its creativity is
limited.

I signaled a similar leaning before. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 484—
85. Yet I stopped short of granting summary judgment based
on factual disputes about how much creativity was involved.
Now, as I concluded above, there is no factual dispute that the
head-notes have creative elements but are far from the most
creative works.

So factor two goes for Ross. Note, though, that this factor “has
rarely played a significant role in the determination of a fair
use dispute.” Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at 220.

C. Factor three goes to Ross

Third, I focus on how much of the work was used and how
substantial a part it was relative to the whole. 17 U.S.C. §
107(3). Lask whether that usage was “reasonable in relation to
the purpose of the copying.” Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music,
Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994). Courts consider both “the quantity of the materials
used” and “their quality and importance.” /d. at 587, 114 S.Ct.
1164. To win on this factor, the alleged copier must not take
the “heart” of the work. /d.

My prior opinion did not decide factor three but suggested that
it leaned towards Ross. The opinion focused on Ross's claim
that its output to an end user is a judicial opinion, not a West
headnote, so it “communicates little sense of the original.”
694 F. Supp. 3d at 485 (quoting Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at
223).

I stand by that reasoning, but now go a step further and decide
factor three for Ross. There is no factual dispute: Ross's output
to an end user does not include a West headnote. What matters
is not “the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
making a copy, but rather the amount and substantiality of
what is thereby made accessible to a public for which it may
serve as a competing substitute.” Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at
222 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Ross did not
make West headnotes available to the public, Ross benefits
from factor three.

In its briefing, Ross emphasized that the number of headnotes

allegedly taken amounted to only a small percentage of the
total headnotes owned by Westlaw. That argument is inapt.

WESTLAW

If taking 300 words out of President Ford's memoirs could
count as taking the heart of the work, so too can taking several
thousand headnotes out of Westlaw. Campbell, 510 U.S. at
587, 114 S.Ct. 1164. The percentage of a total work copied
is neither necessary nor sufficient to decide factor three. But
Ross wins this factor anyway.

D. Factor four goes to Thomson Reuters

Factor four “is undoubtedly the single most important element
of fair use.” Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218.
For this factor, I consider the “likely effect [of Ross's copying]
on the market for the original.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590,
114 S.Ct. 1164. I must consider not only current markets but
also potential derivative ones “that creators of original works
would in general develop or license others to develop.” Jd.
at 592, 114 S.Ct. 1164. I also consider any “public benefits
the copying will likely produce.” Google, 593 U.S. at 35,
141 S.Ct. 1183. The original market is obvious: legal-research
platforms. And at least one potential derivative market is also
obvious: data to train legal Als.

*10 My prior opinion left this factor for the jury. I thought
that “Ross's use might be transformative, creating a brand-
new research platform that serves a different purpose than
Westlaw.” 694 F. Supp. 3d at 486. If that were true, then Ross
would not be a market substitute for Westlaw. Plus, I worried
whether there was a relevant, genuine issue of material fact
about whether Thomson Reuters would use its data to train AI
tools or sell its headnotes as training data. /d. And | thought
a jury ought to sort out “whether the public's interest is better
served by protecting a creator or a copier.” Jd.

In hindsight, those concerns are unpersuasive. Even taking all
facts in favor of Ross, it meant to compete with Westlaw by
developing a market substitute. D.I. 752-1 at 4. And it does
not matter whether Thomson Reuters has used the data to train
its own legal search tools; the effect on a potential market for
Al training data is enough. Ross bears the burden of proof. It
has not put forward enough facts to show that these markets
do not exist and would not be affected.

Nor does a possible benefit to the public save Ross. Yes, there
is a public interest in accessing the law. But legal opinions
are freely available, and “the public's interest in the subject
matter” alone is not enough. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 569,
105 S.Ct. 2218. The public has no right to Thomson Reuters's


--- Page 10 ---
Colby, Alexandra 3/2/2025
For Educational Use Only

Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross..., --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2025)

parsing of the law. Copyrights encourage people to develop
things that help society, like good legal-research tools. Their
builders earn the right to be paid accordingly. This case is
distinguishable from Google, where the API was valuable
“because users, including programmers, [were] just used to
it.” 593 U.S. at 38, 141 S.Ct. 1183. There is nothing that
Thomson Reuters created that Ross could not have created
for itself or hired LegalEase to create for it without infringing
Thomson Reuters's copyrights.

E. Balancing the factors, I reject Ross's fair-use
defense
Factors one and four favor Thomson Reuters. Factors two and
three favor Ross. Factor two matters less than the others, and
factor four matters more. Weighing them all together, I grant
summary judgment for Thomson Reuters on fair use.

kK KKK

I grant partial summary judgment to Thomson Reuters on
direct copyright infringement for the headnotes in Appendix
A. For those headnotes, the only remaining factual issue on
iability is that some of those copyrights may have expired
or been untimely created. This factual question underlying
copyright validity is for the jury. I also grant summary
judgment to Thomson Reuters against Ross's defenses of
innocent infringement, copyright misuse, merger, scenes a
faire, and fair use. I deny Ross's motions for summary
judgment on direct copyright infringement and fair use. I
revise all parts of my prior opinions that conflict with this
one. I leave undisturbed the parts of my prior opinion not
addressed in this one, such as my rulings on contributory
iability, vicarious liability, and tortious interference with
contract.

SUMMARY ORDER

Plaintiff-Appellant Lawrence Marano appeals from an order
dismissing his complaint entered on July 13, 2020, and an
order denying his motion for reconsideration entered on
August 14, 2020, in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York (Valerie E. Caproni,
J.). In 2019, Marano brought a copyright action against
the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the “Met”). Marano
alleged that the Met infringed his copyright by featuring a
1982 photograph he took of Eddie Van Halen playing his
“Frankenstein” guitar (the “Photo”) in an exhibition of rock
n’ roll instruments on the Met's website. After briefing on
the fair use exception of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 107,
the district court dismissed Marano's complaint for failure to
state a claim, finding that Marano had “failed to show why
the Met's use of [the Photo] is not protected by the fair use
exception.” *438 Marano v. Metro. Museum of Art, 472 F.
Supp. 3d 76, 80 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), reconsideration denied, No.
19-CV-8606, 2020 WL 4735117 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 2020).
We assume the reader's familiarity with the record.

Marano challenges the district court's determination that the
Met's display of the Photo in its exhibition constitutes fair use.

2021 Copr.L.Dec. P 31,826
For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the
district court.

“Section 107 of the Copyright Act permits the unauthorized
use or reproduction of copyrighted work if it is “for purposes
such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching ...,
scholarship, or research.’ ” Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling
Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605, 608 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting
17 U.S.C. § 107). Courts properly consider four nonexclusive
factors in “determining whether the use made of a work in any
particular case is a fair use”:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether
such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. § 107. These factors “must be viewed collectively,
with their results ‘weighed together, in light of the purposes
of copyright,’ ” namely, “to promote progress in science and
art.” TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168, 178—
79 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music,
Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994)).

“We review de novo a judgment of dismissal under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 12(b)(6), accepting all factual allegations in the ...
complaint and its incorporated exhibits as true and drawing
all reasonable inferences in [the plaintiff's] favor.” Jd. at 177.
Fair use may be “so clearly established by a complaint as to
support dismissal of a copyright infringement claim.” /d. at
178.

Accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, we
conclude that the Met's display of the Photo in its website
exhibition constituted fair use. We begin with the first factor
—often framed as whether the use is “transformative’—
which constitutes the “heart of the fair use inquiry.” Blanch
vy. Koons, 467 F.3d 244, 251 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Davis
v. The Gap, Inc., 246 F.3d 152, 174 (2d Cir. 2001)). The
Met's exhibition transformed the Photo by foregrounding

the instrument rather than the performer. Whereas Marano's
stated purpose in creating the Photo was to show “what
Van Halen looks like in performance,” App'x at 29, the Met
exhibition highlights the unique design of the Frankenstein
guitar and its significance in the development of rock n’
roll instruments. Further, the Photo appears alongside other
photographs showing the physical composition of the guitar,
which are collectively accompanied by text discussing the
guitar's genesis, specifications, and impact on rock n’ roll
music, not Van Halen's biography or discography. This
context “adds something new, with a further purpose or
different character, altering the [Photo] with new expression,
meaning, or message.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164.

Marano contends that the Met's display of the Photo is
not sufficiently transformative for fair use because the Met
charges admission and provides entertainment. Yet the Met
was founded “for the purpose of establishing and maintaining
in [New York City] a Museum and library of art,” and
it remains a nonprofit that “collects, studies, conserves,
and presents significant works of art.” App'x 70. Although
the Met charges a nominal fee to out-of-state visitors
who visit the physical museum, the museum's website—the
subject of Marano's *439 copyright claim—is both free and
publicly available, serving to “extend [the Met's] cultural and
academic reach ... by welcoming without charge millions of
virtual visitors every year.” App'x 44, 95. These purposes are
not commercial; to the contrary, they align the Met's fair use
of the Photo with “copyright's very purpose, ‘[t]o promote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts.’ ” Campbell, 510 U.S. at
578, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 8).

This transformative use of the Photo is consistent with the
remaining factors under Section 107 tipping in favor of
fair use. While the Photo is a “creative work of art,” that
determination is of “limited usefulness” given that the Met is
using the Photo “for a transformative purpose.” Bill Graham,
448 F.3d at 612. Similarly, the Met's “copying the entirety of
[the Photo] [was] ... necessary to make a fair use of the image”
as one of many “historical artifacts” in the exhibition. /d. at
613. Likewise, a “transformative market” does not qualify as
a “traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed market,”
id. at 614 (quoting Am. Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60
F.3d 913, 930 (2d Cir. 1994)), and therefore Marano cannot
“prevent others from entering fair use markets merely ‘by
developing or licensing a market for ... transformative uses

of [his] own creative work,’ ” id. at 615 (quoting Caséle
Rock Ent., Inc. v. Carol Pub. Grp., Inc., 150 F.3d 132, 146
n.ll (2d Cir. 1998)). There is no indication in the record
that the Met's use of the Photo on a web page describing
the Frankenstein guitar could, in any way, impair any other
market for commercial use of the Photo, or diminish its value.
On balance, these factors indicate that the Met's display of the
Photo qualifies for the fair use exception under Section 107.

Marano protests that this holding would extinguish copyright
protections for photographers because museums displaying
copyrighted photographs will always be able to assert a fair
use defense by claiming a scholarly, transformative purpose
behind the exhibition. But it has long been established that
“the determination of fair use is an open-ended and context-
sensitive inquiry.” Blanch, 467 F.3d at 251. Here, the district
court appropriately conducted a fair-use analysis that was

“deeply case-specific,” such that “[a] different use by a
museum or art exhibition and combination of factors could
have tipped the scales in the other direction.” Marano, 2020
WL 4735117, at *1. Such individualized analysis is precisely
what Section 107 requires, and we discern no error in the
district court's conclusion that the fair use exception applies
to the Met's display of the Photo.

We have considered Marano's remaining arguments and find
them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the
judgment of the district court.

SUMMARY ORDER

Plaintiff-Appellant Lawrence Marano appeals from an order
dismissing his complaint entered on July 13, 2020, and an
order denying his motion for reconsideration entered on
August 14, 2020, in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York (Valerie E. Caproni,
J.). In 2019, Marano brought a copyright action against
the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the “Met”). Marano
alleged that the Met infringed his copyright by featuring a
1982 photograph he took of Eddie Van Halen playing his
“Frankenstein” guitar (the “Photo”) in an exhibition of rock
n’ roll instruments on the Met's website. After briefing on
the fair use exception of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 107,
the district court dismissed Marano's complaint for failure to
state a claim, finding that Marano had “failed to show why
the Met's use of [the Photo] is not protected by the fair use
exception.” *438 Marano v. Metro. Museum of Art, 472 F.
Supp. 3d 76, 80 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), reconsideration denied, No.
19-CV-8606, 2020 WL 4735117 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 2020).
We assume the reader's familiarity with the record.

Marano challenges the district court's determination that the
Met's display of the Photo in its exhibition constitutes fair use.

For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the
district court.

“Section 107 of the Copyright Act permits the unauthorized
use or reproduction of copyrighted work if it is “for purposes
such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching ...,
scholarship, or research.’ ” Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling
Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605, 608 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting
17 U.S.C. § 107). Courts properly consider four nonexclusive
factors in “determining whether the use made of a work in any
particular case is a fair use”:

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether
such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work.

17 U.S.C. § 107. These factors “must be viewed collectively,
with their results ‘weighed together, in light of the purposes
of copyright,’ ” namely, “to promote progress in science and
art.” TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168, 178—
79 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music,
Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994)).

“We review de novo a judgment of dismissal under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 12(b)(6), accepting all factual allegations in the ...

all reasonable inferences in [the plaintiff's] favor.” Jd. at 177.
